  I couldn't find anything by that name in the textbook, so I am assuming you mean the "Principle of Repeated Improvement:. This just means that the more we iterate this procedure, the more refined/"better" our outcomes will be. Given that we start with all scores at 1, running our hub-authority calculation once won't give us a great sense of how these values will change. It is when we iterate multiple times that the scores of hubs and authorities really start to differentiate themselves and give us some clear conclusions
