 For this question, I am not exactly sure how to start/think about these questions. Could I please get some insight on potentially how to go about these questions?
</p>
<p>
 Additionally for q 4a, when the question says "influenced by their signal," does it refer to the high/low value that each person gets or the accept/reject value that they get from the previous individual?

  Recall how we went about this in lecture, where the person's decision depended on which marble they drew. There was a point reached when a person's best guess didn't depend on what they drew. This would mean that they are no longer "influenced by their signal", where being "influenced" means that your best decision depends on the signal you receive (for clarification, look to the definition - we get
  <b>
   signals
  </b>
  as our private information and the
  <b>
   choices
  </b>
  (decisions) of those before us)
