  When it comes to using the VCG procedure for ad slots, how can we prove / argue if a set of matching (advertisers to slots)
  <bold>
   <italic>
    IS NOT
   </italic>
  </bold>
  the Nash Equilibrium (NE)?

  I understand that to prove / argue that a set of matching
  <bold>
   <italic>
    IS
   </italic>
  </bold>
  the Nash Equilibrium, we can argue how each advertiser would not want to change their ad slot because their payoffs are maximized; but, I am wondering what the key points are in demonstrating that a set of matching is NOT the NE.

  Furthermore, can there be more than one NE in such scenarios?

  I think if one can show an advertiser can do better by changing the bid, then the setup is not NE

  To answer your other question, yes; it was mentioned in class, but never shown. However, consider a setup where a few bidders bid 1, 2, 3, 4, and the fifth bidder bids 1000. If this is a NE, then the fifth bidder changing their bid to 999 is unlikely to actually impact whether it's a NE or not.
