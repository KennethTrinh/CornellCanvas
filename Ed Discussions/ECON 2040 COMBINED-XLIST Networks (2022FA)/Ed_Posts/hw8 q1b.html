<p>
 can a set be r-dense if it has r fraction of its neighbors in the set or only if it has &gt; r fraction of its neighbors in the set?

  Terminology clarification: a
  <i>
   node
  </i>
  has neighbors, whereas a
  <i>
   cluster
  </i>
  (of nodes) has density. A cluster is considered to have density
  <code>
   n
  </code>
  if all nodes in the cluster have
  <underline>
   at least
  </underline>
  a fraction
  <code>
   n
  </code>
  of their neighbors also in the cluster. Clusters are similar to a set (of nodes), but we consider them clusters when talking about their density.
 </p>
 <p>
  As a (hopefully helpful) example, consider the network below:
 </p>
 <figure>
  <image height="141" src="https://static.us.edusercontent.com/files/CdjEJS9wYXeAW1ogkI4Yakee" width="191"/>
 </figure>
 <p>
  Specifically, consider the cluster (A,B,C,D):
 </p>
 <list style="bullet">
  <li>
   <p>
    A has 100% (1) of its neighbors also in the set
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    B has 75% (3/4) of its neighbors also in the set
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    C has 100% (1) of its neighbors also in the set
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    D has 75% (3/4) of its neighbors also in the set
   </p>
  </li>
 </list>
 <p>
  Therefore, the maximum density this cluster can be considered to have is 3/4
