 I wanted to make sure the blog due dates by last name on the pdf (
 <a href="www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs2850/2022fa/blog-guidelines.pdf">
  www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs2850/2022fa/blog-guidelines.pdf
 </a>
 ) are correct. I think in class we were told A last names had blogs due the 12 but the pdf says the 22. Am I just remembering wrong?

  The professor said the first group is due on September 12, which is not actually A names.
