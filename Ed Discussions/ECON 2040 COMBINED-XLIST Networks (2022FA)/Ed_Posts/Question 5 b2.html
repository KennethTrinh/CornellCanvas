 Are we assuming values per click are restricted to natural numbers or could advertiser W have a value per click of any positive real number?
</p>
<p>
 Also, are we assuming that the values per click for other bidders have remained the same from part a? I would think not because I solved it assuming this and proved that X would have to be wrong about knowing W has the lowest value per click.

  The values remain the same from Part A (at least from my interpretation)
