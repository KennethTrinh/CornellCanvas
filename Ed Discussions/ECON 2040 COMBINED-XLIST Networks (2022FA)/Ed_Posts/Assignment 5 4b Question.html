  This question is about 4b on assignment 5:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  In the question's scenario, is it possible that a bidder could raise their own value to improve their payoffs? Or is it safe to say that will they never pay more than they bet originally, as it is too risky? (ex: bidder y, who is bellow x, raises his bet from 6 to 7 to achieve a higher payoff overall).

  1) A bidder's
  <bold>
   value
  </bold>
  will never raise, but their
  <bold>
   bid
  </bold>
  may - the two are separate
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2) If it is possible for a bidder to improve their payoff by raising their bet, then they will do so - in general, bidders will always seek a better payoff, with their bid as a ways to achieve that.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  3) What do you mean by "risky"? There isn't really a sense of "risk" in this problem - we are simply analyzing whether we're at an equilibrium (where we assume we know all aspects, including private bids, in order to analyze, so there is no unknown information or risk)

  In problem 4 in general, are the bids the Clicks-Per-Value? And we determine if said bids are at equilibrium when neither raising nor dropping said bids yields a better payoff?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I'm doing problem 4 by comparing payoffs (CTR*(1st - 2nd value)) before and after raising / lowering individual bids. Is this a proper way of proving equilibrium? Or are their extra steps?

  The bids are given in "per click" form (we never have a "Clicks-Per-Value" notion). They are independent of values.

  Yes, that is the definition of being at equilibrium - you should prove that no matter how much one raises/lowers their bid, they never get a better payoff. You have to show this in general (for any increase/decrease), but it is helpful to note that a buyer's payoff only changes when their bid changes which item they get.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  On a side note, we don't have any notion of 1st and 2nd values - each buyer only has one value. A buyer's payoff can be expressed as
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  CTR_{\text{item received}}\cdot\left(\text{Value}_{per\ click}-\text{Price}_{per\ click}\right)
 </math>
