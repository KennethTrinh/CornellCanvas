  In class on 11/16, we saw how if strategy A is an evolutionarily stable strategy, then (A, A) is a Nash Equilibrium. Does this work the other way as well, where if a strategy is a Nash equilibrium, the strategy is an evolutionarily stable strategy?

  No, there's a counterexample in the lecture notes.

  I think the answer to Q4 on HW9 also shows this :)

  what about the complement? if a strategy is not an ESS, does that mean it is not a NE? or does it only work for if a strategy is an ESS then it is a NE?

  Nope, that logic doesn't quite hold: if A implies B, then (not A) doesn't necessarily imply (not B). However, a valid assertion would be (not B) implies (not A) (in this case, that would be saying that if A isn't a Nash Equilibria, then it can't be an ESS).

  Additionally, the counterexample above would also disprove this (the one where a Nash Equilibria is not an ESS)
