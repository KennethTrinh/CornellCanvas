  because it's the outside options (in this case 0 and 3) + the surplus/2 (9/2)

  if we're given a graph and we're asked to find a stable &amp; nash bargaining outcome, what would the easiest way be to do this?

  Find the outside options for each of the nodes, calculate the surplus between those two nodes, divide the surplus by two and add that back to each outside option ^ (for any pair of nodes) - there's more info on this in chapter 12/on the slides on canvas, though

  how do we know the oo though? Like for example in 7, if we weren't provided with the values of 3 and 9, how would we know that the oo is $3.

  if you aren't given any values, I'm not sure that there's any way to know ... the reason we know that the outside option for B is 3 (in 7b) is because we know the values of C and D (and the total on the edges, and B's value, etc)

  the total possible value on the edge is 12, so you'd treat that like we usually treat 1 in our other examples: surplus = 1 - x - y, so instead of 1 you use 12:

  s = 12 - 0 - 3 = 9
