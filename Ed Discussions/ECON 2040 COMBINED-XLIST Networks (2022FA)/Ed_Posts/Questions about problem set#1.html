 1.a:
</p>
<p>
 (1) Where do the edges of A-E connect after the F node is taken out? Are they just considered nodes in space without any edges?
</p>
<p>
 (2) Can a node by itself without any edges be considered a component?
</p>
<p>
 1.b &amp; 1.c:
</p>
<p>
 (3) Can we have two answers to this question, or is there only one correct answer?
</p>
<p>
 2.b, 2.c, 2.d
</p>
<p>
 (4) Do we have to use polygons for our drawings, or are curves and lines okay?
</p>
<p>
 4.a
</p>
<p>
 (5) "Letâ€™s suppose that there is a strong tie between each pair of people who live on the same floor"
</p>
<p>
 What does "strong tie between each pair of people" mean?
</p>
<p>
 Does this mean that if there are 20 people living on the same floor, there are 10 ties?
</p>
<p>
 For example... Let's say that Brandon, Marcus, Alissa, and Taylor all live on the same floor. If Brandon and Marcus have a strong tie and Alissa and Taylor have a strong tie, does Alissa and Marcus have weak/no ties?
</p>
<p>
 Or is it that everyone on the same floor has strong ties with each other (Brandon, Marcus, Alissa, and Taylor all have strong ties with each other)?

  (1) When a node is taken out, so are all the edges that leave/enter the node.
 </p>
 <p>
  (2) Yes, a single node with no edges still fits the definition of a connected component: "a subset of the nodes such that: (i) every node in the subset has a path to every other; and (ii) the subset is not part of some larger set with the property that every node can reach every other" (Chapter 2)
 </p>
 <p>
  (3) If there are multiple nodes that fit the property, you are only required to mention one example.
 </p>
 <p>
  (4) I believe a scene should only be "geometric arrangement of points and filled-in polygons" as defined in question 2.

  (5) A "strong tie between each pair of people" means everyone on the floor has strong ties with each other, your second example. Brandon would have a strong tie with Marcus, Alissa, and Taylor (everyone on their floor). Similarly, Marcus would have a strong tie with Brandon (as mentioned before, because it goes both ways), Alissa, and Taylor too.
