 Is it possible for the next problem sets to be spaced out a bit so students working on tablets can put their answers right below the questions?

   As stated in the course syllabus, we require homework to be typed. We recommend using Latex or (less ideally) Microsoft word to type up your solutions.

    Will .tex templates be provided? Or should we create our own?

     On the instructions for Homework 1 it says that "it is fine to create the homework in any format provided it's handed in as a single PDF file". I think many students may interpret this as meaning it is allowed to hand write solutions on a tablet and export to PDF. To clarify, this is not allowed?

      When I took the class last year, all homeworks were only allowed to be typed up (ie no handwriting of any form). However, Professor Halpern taught the class last year so Professor Kleinberg may have a different opinion regarding this policy. I will check with the professors regarding this. For now, I suggest typing up the homework
