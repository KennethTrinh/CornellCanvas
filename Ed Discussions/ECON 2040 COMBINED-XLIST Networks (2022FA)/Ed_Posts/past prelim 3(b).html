  Isn't stating that "the nash equilibrium will be when the 2 routes cost the same time" a better explanation for 3(b).

  For the first part, I wouldn't say so - there can be Nash Equilibria when the two routes don't take the same time. A basic example would be when there are two routes from A to B; the first takes 1 hour, and the second takes 2 hours, regardless of the number of travellers on either. The Nash Equilibria will be everyone taking the first route,
  <italic>
   but this doesn't make the two routes cost the same time
  </italic>
  . We need to first establish that both routes would be taken (because if one wasn't it would be a better option than the route everyone is taking).

  The second part of the explanation is synonymous to what you're saying, so you might include it as further explanation there (although given their answer I'm not sure it's necessary, but if you want to play it safe). You definitely need the first part though
