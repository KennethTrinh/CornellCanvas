 If eqilibrium are values that don't change on the next step, it isn't clear that's possible with the values in 3b.

 given that the formulas are very simple I made a spreadsheet to track the steps after doing extensive calculations by hand, and got nothing that remained the same from one iteration to the next.

  In 3b, you can use the equilibrium values you found in 3a for each node, which should be in relation to x (the equilibrium value for node A). Then, remember that PageRank should sum to 1. Hope this helps!

   So again I ask which step this is at. Because at step 0, values are, per the book, all equal. So is 3a step 0 and 3b step 1?

    This is not a step - the problem doesn't ask you to step through. The answer above is correct. The algorithm for finding equilibrium values for this problem (covered in class) doesn't involve stepping
