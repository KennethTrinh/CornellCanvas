  Hi, I see the idea that market-clearing prices are socially optimal. Is the idea just that there exists one perfect-matching that is market-clearing and most socially optimal or is that every single one is optimal? I don't understand because wouldn't just the one set of market-clearing prices where the prices are at a minimum be social welfare maximizing, and every other set would be less optimal? Thanks

  To my understanding, any market-clearing prices will result in social welfare maximizing: "Optimality of Market-Clearing Prices: For any set of market-clearing prices, a perfect matching in the resulting preferred-seller graph has the maximum total valuation of any assignment of sellers to buyers."

  the maximum total valuation here is the same thing as social-welfare maximizing.

  It doesn't really matter if the market clearing prices are the minimum, and the reason is that when calculating the social-welfare, we are adding the sum of prices and the sum of net value for buyers. Imagine prices go up, net value goes down, but overall if it's market clearing, it's still the same social welfare. I hope this helps!

  Hi, I think I'm starting to understand, but could you provide an example that quantifies the social welfare and shows how it remains the same. Thank you!!

  sure! so in this example, the market clearing price in the picture is A =2, B=2, C=0, and total value = sum of prices + sum of total net values for buyers = 25. And if we increases all the prices by 1, it is still market clearing and the net value is still 25. 25 is the social welfare maximizing.

  Thank you so much! My confusion came from thinking we subtracted the prices.
