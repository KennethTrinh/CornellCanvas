  Can someone please explain how to solve for the equilibrium PageRank values of all nodes in terms of actual numbers? I can't find a good explanation in notes/videos and I am very confused

  Does the example from the Practice Final, 6b work? For this, we've already found the values in terms of
  <code>
   a
  </code>
  in Part A (as we can use the Basic PageRank Update Rule to see how PageRank would flow and get equilibrium values, knowing that PageRank is split evenly among outward paths and becomes the sum of PageRank flowing on inward paths for every node)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  From there, going to actual numbers is simply remembering our convention is that the sum of PageRank in the network is equal to 1. By summing the PageRank of all nodes (in terms of
  <code>
   a
  </code>
  ) and setting it equal to 1, we can solve for
  <code>
   a
  </code>
  , and use that value to translate values in terms of
  <code>
   a
  </code>
  into actual numbers.
