 Hi, can anyone help explain why the lowest market-clearing price is 9, and why the highest market-clearing price is 12? Thanks.

  The lowest possible price is 9 because it is the lowest price where a perfect matching is present in the preferred seller network. X would still have A as a favorite outcome, and Y and Z both have at least one of their preferred outcomes being not getting A (Y has negative payoff and doesn't want it, and Z could go either way, as the payoffs for getting and not getting A are 0). In class, we demonstrated this by creating "fake items" with zero value to represent the choice of not getting any of the other items

  Similarly, if we increase the price beyond 12, then nobody will have buying A as a preferred outcome (X would still have a preferred outcome of taking A at price 12, even with zero payoff, but would prefer not to at a higher price). This would mean that we can't have a perfect matching in the preferred seller network (there is no buyer for item A), meaning that prices beyond 12 can't be market-clearing
