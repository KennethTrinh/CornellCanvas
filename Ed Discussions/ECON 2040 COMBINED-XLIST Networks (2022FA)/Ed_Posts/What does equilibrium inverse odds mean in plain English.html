  It is the inverse (raised to the -1) of the odds that we should offer in an equilibrium state (where we pay out exactly what we receive). We use the inverse because of it's relation to probability; if an outcome is more likely (higher probability), then to be in equilibrium, we should offer lower odds, meaning higher inverse odds, allowing for the trend in probability to be in the same direction as inverse equilibrium odds
