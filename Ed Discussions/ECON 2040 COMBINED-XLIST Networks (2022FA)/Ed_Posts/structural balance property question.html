<p>
 does the structural balance property only apply for graphs of at least 3 nodes? can we use the property to determine balance between a one node or two nodes graph? thank you.

  By the definition in Chapter 5.1, the structural balance property does not apply for graphs of 1 or 2 nodes. However, it does apply for graphs that have 3 or more nodes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here's the definition:
 </p>
 <p>
  "Structural Balance Property: For every set of three nodes, if we consider the three edges connecting them, either all three of these edges are labeled +, or exactly one of them is labeled +."
 </p>

   okay i see. then what would be the correct answer for this question? i was thinking of k = 1 and k= 2 bc k &gt; 2 does not satisfy the structural balance property.

    Assuming that a social group contains 3 or more people, I agree that k = 1 and k = 2 is the correct answer. If k &gt;= 3, then you could pick out three nodes, each from different social groups, to form a structurally unbalanced graph.
