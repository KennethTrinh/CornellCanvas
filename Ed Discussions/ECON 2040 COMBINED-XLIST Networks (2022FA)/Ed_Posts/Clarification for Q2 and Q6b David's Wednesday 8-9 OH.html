  Q2: If both bidders bid 15, then the price the item is sold at would be 15.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Q6b: Welfare-maximizing just means the values for each item each bidder gets before the prices are applied. If I told you to subtract prices to calculate welfare then please don't do that. The prices determine the distribution of the items, which in turn determine the welfare.
