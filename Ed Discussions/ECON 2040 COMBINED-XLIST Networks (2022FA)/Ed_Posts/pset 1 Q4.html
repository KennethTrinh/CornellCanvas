 1. is there any significance in the fact that there are strong ties amongst students on the same floor? if so, how would this affect the STC property?
</p>
<p>
 2. should we look at the graph holistically and only consider whether or not there are strong ties between one floor and another and disregard the fact that there are strong ties between students of the same floor?
</p>

  You should think of ties as being between students, not floors. So all ties (whether between students on the same floor or different floors) are important to consider. Feel free to ask a follow-up if this didn't clarify your questions.

   let's say that I am drawing a graph for the situation in 4a. should I only consider whether or not there are strong ties between the floors or should I also factor in the fact that students on the same floor have strong ties between them?

     I am having a hard time understanding how the strong ties between the students would impact the graph overall. Is there any way to give an example of such?

      Here's an example. Let's suppose that there are 3 students on floor 1 and 3 students on floor 2. Suppose that students that are on the same floor have strong ties between them, and that students on different floors have weak ties between them. Then the above graph visualizes these relationships (the triangle on the left is floor 1, and the triangle on the right is floor 2), with bold lines being strong ties and thin lines being weak ties.
     </p>
     <p>
      We can then check if a node satisfies strong triadic closure by examining which nodes it shares strong ties with. In the problem, where there are 20 students, it will be hard to draw the network out, but you can still think about the types of ties each individual student has. Hope this helps!
