  If you have wealth $w$ and belief that $A$ will win of $a$, then the textbook says you get $w \cdot a \cdot O_A$ as a payoff when $A$ wins.

  For question one, the race track is the one that pays according to the bets (i.e. if horse A wins then the race track gives some amount of money to the bettors). The bettors are not directly betting against each other, they are just trying to maximize expected utility of wealth. If p = q, then it just means that bettor A and bettor B both think that horse A will win with the same probability.
