  I'm confused on question 2A -- are we supposed to find market-clearing prices using the VCG procedure or through a market-clearing price-finding procedure previously learned? What is the difference between 2A and 2B?

  2A didn't specify that you have to use VCG, so it's okay if you use the procedure that we previously learned. However, 2B did specify that the search engine runs the VCG procedures, in which case you have to VCG.
