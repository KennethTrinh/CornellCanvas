 What happens if two advertisers x and y have the same bid in a GSP auction with advertisers x, y, and z (assume that the bids from x and y are greater than the one from z)? Will both x and y pay z's bid, will both x and y pay their own bids, or will something else happen entirely?

  Based on how we handled it with the single-unit second-price auction (#315, as well as a couple others), a winner will be chosen somehow (up to the specific auction), but will pay the value of the equivalent bid
