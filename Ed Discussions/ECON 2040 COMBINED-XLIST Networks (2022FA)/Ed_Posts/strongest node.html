  why is nodes b, c, and d the strongest? why wouldn't just node c be the most powerful node? node c has most outside options that nodes b and d, so shouldn't that make it more powerful?

  I think it's because A and E both have no other options, which means they get abt 0, and B and D get about 1. Same applies for F and C... since B and D both have 1 C can't get anything from them and therefore they are equally as powerful.
