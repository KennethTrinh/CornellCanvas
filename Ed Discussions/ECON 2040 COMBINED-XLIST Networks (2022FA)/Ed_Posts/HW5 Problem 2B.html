 How are we supposed to do VCG to get prices
 <b>
  without
 </b>
 the values per click if all I have is the CTR and the slot assignment?
</p>
<p>
 My TA didn't know how to do it either...

  As it turns out, you
  <b>
   DO
  </b>
  have the values per click, they are just not given obviously. Remember that there is always a dominant strategy for buyers who participate in the VCG algorithm, and that the VCG algorithm can determine the values of the buyers using this...

   Sorry, I'm still confused.

  <p>
   I believe the dominant strategy is to bid your value, but all I have for the bid is that X bid the highest, Y bid the lowest, and Z bid in the middle.
  </p>
  <p>
   I think I'm supposed to use bid*CTR to determine the 3x3 and get the prices... but I don't have bids. Are we supposed to treat the value per click as a bid?

    I think your first statement ("I believe the dominant strategy is to bid your value") answers your question ("Are we supposed to treat the value per click as a bid"). The key is to keep track what numbers are "per click" and what are absolute - hope this helps!
