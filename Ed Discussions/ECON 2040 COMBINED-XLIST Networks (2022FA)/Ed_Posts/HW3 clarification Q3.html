  Hello,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  In the network traffic question with an x and a y both defined as the traffic on a certain road, can we assume that x=y? If not, should we look for some other equation (besides the Nash Equilibrium one) that will create a system of equations for us to solve so we can find both variables?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thank you!

  We cannot assume that x=y, as they are completely separate roads, and therefore will likely contain different numbers of drivers. Using the result from imposing Nash Equilibrium conditions on the problem should be sufficient to solve it
