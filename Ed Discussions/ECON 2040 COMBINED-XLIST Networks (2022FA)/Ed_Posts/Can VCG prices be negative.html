  This would not intuitively make sense, as negative harm would be not harm
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I need to know if my approach and calculations are thus wrong

  if harm is negative, meaning the other bidders must change their slot to a worse one without the presence of this bidder, which is not possible as they can just stay at their original slot.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  So not possible

  In 3b, can that table be operated on like it’s a table of values in the VSG videos, or does it need manipulation?

  I am pretty sure it is the table. VCG is not just for ad slots, we use CTR and value/click just for the sake of demonstarting a "real life" application

  Lmk where my thinking is wrong then:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Without Y the VSG price for B would go to Z, so that would result in X(10) + Z (7) - X(10) + Z(8)

  when x picks 10--aka item a, without y, z can choose from item b and c, why does it pick 7 over 8?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  without y, x picks item a, and z picks item c, the total value is 10+8=18
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  with y picking item a, x can only do item c, and z can only do item b, so the total value is 9+7=16
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>

 <paragraph>
  It seems to me is ur VCG matching is not correct, are you sure the matching maximizes your total valuation?

  I actually did get that matching, but the prices resulted in some negative values. Ie, applying a price of1 across the three values for C (9,0,8) resulted in (8,-1,7) which I didn’t know if that was ok

  if the price is larger than the value, the value is just 0, because the value can never be negative as the person can just not buy it
