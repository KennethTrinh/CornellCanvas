 Hey! Just wondering if there's an error on the solution for practice prelim 2b? Shouldn't it be 5p +
 <b>
  <underline>
   3
  </underline>
 </b>
 <underline>
  (
 </underline>
 1 −p) = 2p + 4(1 −p) and 5q + 2(1 −q) =
 <b>
  <underline>
   1
  </underline>
 </b>
 q + 4(1 −q) according to the payoff matrix ?
</p>
<p>
 Thanks!
</p>

  Not quite - looks like you're mixing up p and q.
 </p>
 <p>
  p is A's probability of playing U, so given that 3 is a payoff for A, it shouldn't be dependent on A's probability. Same logic can go for the other change you noted. The first entry is A's payoff, and the second is B's payoff. The solution should be correct
