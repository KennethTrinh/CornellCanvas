  The textbook specifies in part (c) of 18.3 that "This describes the creation of a single link from page j; one can repeat this process to create multiple, independently generated links from page j. (However, to keep things simple, we will suppose that each page creates just one outbound link.)" For 4A, does this mean that a node can't have more than one outgoing link? Thanks!
