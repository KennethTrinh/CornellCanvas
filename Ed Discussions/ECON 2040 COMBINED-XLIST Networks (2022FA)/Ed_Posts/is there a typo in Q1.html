  p and q are two probabilities for winning, not one for winning the other for losing? though, arguably, if one is greater than the other it could represent that...

  Correct me if I'm wrong- From what I gathered in office hours p and q are each independent probabilities of A winning. I think of p and q as guesses, and as horse A wins or loses, each guess is revealed to be closer or further from the true probability of horse A winning. The probability of A losing would then be 1-p or 1-q respectively.

  1) Yup - p and q are what the bettors believe the probabilities are

  2) We're not too concerned with how close a guess is to the true probability - it's just what they believe. However, they may have updated probabilities after observing that horse A wins. That comes in part (d), so you're basing a probability on an event happening - sounds like Bayes' Rule to me!
