 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 For problem 4a, how do we evaluate a payoff for receiving an advertising slot at a certain price. Would it be value gained subtracted by price or should we only consider value earned?

  Your logic is correct. Think about how much value can a bidder gets from the transaction: the payoff for receiving a slot at a certain price is the value that the bidder has for a slot subtracts the price the bidder has to pay
