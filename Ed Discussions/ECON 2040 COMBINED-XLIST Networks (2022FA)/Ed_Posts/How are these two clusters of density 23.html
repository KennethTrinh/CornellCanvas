  Looking at the definition right below:
 </p>
 <p>
  "We say that a cluster of density p is a set of nodes such that each node in the set has at least a p fraction of its network neighbors in the set"
 </p>
 <p>
  For each of the circles clusters, the maximum value p can take is 2/3 (The first cluster is limited by Node 2, who has 2/3 of its neighbors in the cluster, and the second is limited by Nodes 11 and 14, each of which have 2/3 of their neighbors in the cluster - all other nodes in the clusters have a greater fraction of their neighbors in the cluster)
 </p>

    Whatâ€™s a limiting node

    <p>
     "Limiting node" sounds a bit technical, but a node that limits the density of the cluster is the one with the least fraction of its neighbors also inside the cluster. The density of this cluster can therefore be no more than this fraction
