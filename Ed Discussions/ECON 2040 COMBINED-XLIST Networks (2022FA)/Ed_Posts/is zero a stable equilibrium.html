 I don't think the stability of zero was mentioned during our discussion of network effects. Would an equilibrium of z = 0, be considered stable?

  Yes*

  To elaborate: z=0 is considered a stable equilibria in this class, but one interesting point is to consider why. For z=0, the reservation price is below the actual price, so we'd expect the fraction of people buying to decrease,
  <i>
   except they can't decrease below zero
  </i>
  , so it is an equilibria in the sense that the number of people won't change.
 </p>
 <p>
  The stability comes into play when considering how small perturbations will affect it. If we have
  <i>
   slightly
  </i>
  more than z=0, those additional people will have reservation price below the actual price, and wouldn't actually want to buy for that value of z. This means that if we were to shift slightly away from the equilibria, these people would stop buying and we'd shift back towards z=0, making it stable.

  Lastly, I believe it was mentioned in lecture - see the slides from Halloween
