 I understand how to approach this problem using the VCG procedure, but can't figure out how to get these prices in the regular market-clearing procedure.
</p>
<p>
 Could you explain the process behind this? Thank you so much

  The procedure Varun mentioned does work and is a good intuitive way to get to an answer quickly. The more "step-by-step" process learned in class would be to find the constricted set (buyers x, y, and z all want item a) and raise that price by 1 (or to speed it up, raise it until one of the buyers switches to being indifferent between item a and another item). Repeat this process until you no longer have a constricted set, or so that some buyers are indifferent between certain items and are willing to take an item that no one else wants.

   The way I like to go about it is to try to find prices to ensure x prefers a, z prefers b, and y prefers c.
  </p>
  <p>
   In order for x to prefer a, the price of a should be &lt;= 25, because otherwise b would be preferable for x. So we could do something like 23.
  </p>
  <p>
   Now, z currently prefers b (15 &gt; 7,3) but so does y (10 &gt; -3,2). In order for y to prefer c but z to still prefer b, we need a price on b that is &lt;= 12 but also &gt;= 8. So a price of 8 would work for b.
  </p>
  <p>
   Then, the price on c would be 0.
