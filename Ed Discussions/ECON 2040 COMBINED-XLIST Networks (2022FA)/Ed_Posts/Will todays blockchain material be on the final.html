  From lecture, I believe the answer was that there could be a question about the high-level ideas covered (what happens when the committee size increases, what is the equilibrium number of miners, etc.), but nothing about the actual implementation of these schemes (at least, not without the question explaining it - it could be a nice substrate for a Bayes' Rule question) No clue about if/when lecture notes will be posted though
