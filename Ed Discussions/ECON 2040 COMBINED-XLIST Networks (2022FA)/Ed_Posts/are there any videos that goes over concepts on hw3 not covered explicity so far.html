 I was relying on the textbook readings to get through some of the questions that were a little challenging and I wasn't exactly sure what parts of the readings were covered and what wasn't. Overall, I felt that learning this material through the textbook was a little confusing. Are there any videos that cover this (specifically on seller revenue, social-welfare, disparity minimization) or would we ever go in-depth about these topics in lecture?

 I was really craving example problems. Are answer keys for the exercise problems on the textbook ever listed? The readings were great as they touched on the topics but the exercise problems were the problems I wish we went over.
