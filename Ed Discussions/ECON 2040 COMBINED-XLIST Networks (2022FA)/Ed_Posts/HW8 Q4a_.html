 In the question, it says, "When a feature starts in region X, it might spread to everyone in X, but it doesn't spread to region Y."
</p>
<p>
 Does this mean that for any person in region X, it only take 1 of their 12 region X friends to play the game in order for them to start playing?
</p>
<p>
 In the second part of that sentence, it says that it doesn't spread to region Y. Does that mean that for any person in region Y, even if both of their 2 friends in region X play the game, they will not play?
</p>
<p>
 Also, do we need to consider the potential overlap (reciprocal relationship) between a person in region X's 4 friends in region Y and a person in region Y's 2 friends in region X? In other words, between X and Y, are there 6 links (4 from X to Y and 2 from Y to X)?

  A couple of clarifications:
 </p>
 <list style="bullet">
  <li>
   <p>
    We don't assume only one initial starter - the problem qualifies this by saying "with a sufficient number of initial users". Therefore, in the cluster that it starts, you can assume enough initial users that the feature/cheat code spreads
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    It means that no matter what the spread, nobody in Y will adopt it (that would be a valid conclusion to come to based on that, though)
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    I don't think we need to ever consider this - we're really only concerned with whether the spread can get from X to Y or vice versa, so we don't need to worry about the spread possibly going back and forth between clusters. We know it will always spread across the cluster it starts in, but are concerned with whether it spreads to the other cluster
   </p>
  </li>
 </list>
 <p>
  Hope this helps!
