  Do all games have a Mixed Strategy Equilibrium. Because there is no game in which I cannot find p and q.
 </paragraph>

  And if there is always a Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium, is it enough to only states the probabilities for the exam?

  You should always be able to find p and q, but if either is greater than 1, that is not a valid mixed strategy.

  Seeing #236 may help as well. Based on the answer to 2b in the practice exam, I believe it would be sufficient
