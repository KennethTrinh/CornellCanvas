  If a potential buyer wants the item for a price greater than p, will they get the item at all? For example, if the posted price is 5 and there is a "bid" (a buyer offering) 15, would the buyer get the item for 5, 15, or not at all?

  If the posted price of an item is 5 and a buyer has a value of 15 for the item, the buyer will want to purchase that item. They would pay the posted price of 5.

  What is the meaning of having a specification on having a 1/2 chance of choosing between two bidders if they end up paying the reserve price regardless? Wouldn't the end result of the revenue be the same regardless of probability of choice due to both bidders ending up paying the posted price?

  In the case of a tie, the bidder is chosen randomly. But yes, the end result is the same in the case of posted prices as either bidder would pay the posted price should they purchase the item.
