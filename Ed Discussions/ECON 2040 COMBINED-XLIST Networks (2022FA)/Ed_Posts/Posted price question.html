  For the posted price determined by the seller, what happens if a buyer bids more than the posted price? do they get the object for that price? does no one get the object? also is the posted price the seller's value of the object?

  (Assuming you mean question 2) There is no bidding for a posted price, as it's not an auction. Buyers either want it or don't want it at that price, so there's no sense in "bidding" more than the price. You would never "bid", but even if you did, you'd never voluntarily pay more than the posted price
