 The TA in office hours wasn't able to clarify this but I was wondering for 6b and 6c if you could just use your own values instead of those in the chart for 6a?
</p>
<p>
 Also, for 6a, would you count it as 1 round if you raised the price of two constricted sets at the same time, or would this count as 2 rounds? I was told the algorithm is to raise them at the same time, but I don't know if this counts as one round. Thanks!

  Yes, 6b and 6c asks for you to provide your own example/values that fulfill the given properties.
