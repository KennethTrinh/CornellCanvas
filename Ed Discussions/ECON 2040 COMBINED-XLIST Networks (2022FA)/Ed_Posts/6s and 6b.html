  The TA in office hours wasn't able to clarify this but I was wondering for 6b and 6c if you could just use your own values instead of those in the chart for 6a?

  Also, for 6a, would you count it as 1 round if you raised the price of two constricted sets at the same time, or would this count as 2 rounds? I was told the algorithm is to raise them at the same time, but I don't know if this counts as one round. Thanks!
