  I think you might be mixing up two concepts. The STC property is based on strong/weak ties and balanced triangles are based on positive/negative relationships.

  So does the STC property require the triangle in question to consist of three strong ties or are weak ties allowed?

  Node A satisfies the STC property if, for every two nodes A has strong ties to, those two nodes are connected by at least a weak tie (it can also be a strong tie).
