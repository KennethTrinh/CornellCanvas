 Do we need to first calculate the market clearing prices? Or should we use the prices each advertiser pays (the second price auction prices, where advertiser X bids 10 but pays 9 since that's the second highest price)?
</p>
<p>
 I'm not sure how we're supposed to find the payoffs each advertiser could have if they went with another slot, without doing this?

  I'm unsure as to what you're asking - if you already have the price that the advertiser pays, what other price are you computing? Each item only has one price, so if you know the price that's paid for it, there's nothing else to do...
