 I get the answer for question 2 (a) but I don't know how to answer (b). Should we consider that the first student gets a red marble or not? Because getting a red marble is important information to consider but the second student doesn't know. So should be considered from a third-person perspective who knows everything or the second student's perspective.

  The question asks "How should the second student guess" - I think you can assume that it's from the second student's perspective, as it's how
  <i>
   they
  </i>
  (not some external observer) should guess

   Doesn't the second student also know the value of p? Thus, they would not need the first student's guess anyway?

    The second student knows the value of p. I think the second part of your question hints to what the question is getting at...a nice way of answering this is asking "what information does the guess of the first student add"

     Would the second student assume that the first student drew a blue marble, since the first student guessed MB?

      Nope (and that's really important!) Given that the first student guesses MB regardless, the second student can't assume
      <i>
       anything
      </i>
      about what the first student drew
