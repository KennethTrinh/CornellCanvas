  Does every single page have a hub score and an authority score? Or are there some pages that are designated as "hubs" which point to other pages, and some pages that are designated as "authority" that get pointed to by other pages? When we show the resulting values for hub scores and authority scores, do we need to show hub scores for all nodes (even nodes that don't point to anything) and authority scores for all nodes (even nodes that don't get pointed to)?

  Every page has both, but we often only show the "relevant" score(s) (see #372)

  Agreed, in this case it is sufficient to show the "relevant" scores. If you want to be thorough, you can always include a short sentence like: the hub scores of ____ pages are 0.
