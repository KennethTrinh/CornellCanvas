  For question 4, if students on one floor do not satisfy the STC with all students they have a strong or weak tie to, do they violate the STC as a whole? Or can we say that they satisfy the STC in certain cases and in other cases they do not?

  I think its a pretty safe bet to say that if STC is violated in some instances, its violated everywhere
