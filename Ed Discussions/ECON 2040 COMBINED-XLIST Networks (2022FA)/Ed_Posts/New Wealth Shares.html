 In general, how do we calculate new wealth shares and how does that factor into the updated equilibrium inverse odds?

  If the a bettor bets x on a horse A with odds o_A, the bettor's new wealth is x*o_A if horse A wins. Then their new wealth share is x*o_A / total wealth. You can use these new wealth shares in combination with the bettor's beliefs to calculate the updated equilibrium inverse odds (see page 701 of the textbook here for details: https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/networks-book/networks-book-ch22.pdf)
