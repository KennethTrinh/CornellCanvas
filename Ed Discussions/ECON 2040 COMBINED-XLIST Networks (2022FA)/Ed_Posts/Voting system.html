  The theorem is basically stating that if the group prefers X to Y in a ranking, introducing a new alternative Z shouldn't change this (the group ranking should still rank X higher than Y).

  This intuitively makes sense (Z shouldn't change a preference it's not involved in), but the point it introduced is that none of our voting systems (aside from a dictatorship, where the group ranking is the same as a selected individual's) can guarantee this. An example of when this doesn't hold can be found in the same lecture notes (from 11/30) with the Borda count - introducing an alternative Z changes the group ranking's preference of X versus Y
