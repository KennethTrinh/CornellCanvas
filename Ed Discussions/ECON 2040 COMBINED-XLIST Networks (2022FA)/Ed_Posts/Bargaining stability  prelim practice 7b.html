  Initially, I believed stability in networke exchange to mean that the sum of an edge is summed up to 1 or the edge value. But in practice prelim 1 (7c), I saw the case where an outcome was stable when it did not sum up to it's edge value.

  Could someone explain to me in the case where BCD is given 8$ and AEF is given 4$. Why that is stable? Initially, I thought no because the edge value between c and d would sum up greater than 12 but that's not valid reasoning

  A stable outcome is when, for all edges, the values that the nodes at the end of the edge receive is
  <italic>
   <bold>
    less
   </bold>
  </italic>
  than the value of the edge. This is because it means that the edge isn't used, but the nodes collectively would get more by doing a deal along it (as they would split a total value more than their current total value).
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For the given scenario, C and D are currently earning $8 in the setup. Because C and D have a collective value higher than that of an edge, doing a deal along C-D instead means that they would collectively earn less, so neither would want to do it (in order to convince the other, they'd have to adopt a deal to get &lt;4, which is less than they earn currently, so they would not)

  Yes - Nash Bargaining outcomes are a subset of stable outcomes (there can be multiple stable outcomes, but only one Nash Bargaining). Stable is when there is a positive surplus, and Nash Bargaining is when said surplus is split equally
