  I have a general idea of what a stable value is for z, but I was wondering if someone could clearly define what makes a node stable vs unstable an why…

  A stable value of z for the fraction of the population using a product would be a value at which point there is no tendency to move one way or another. A tipping point is not stable because there needs to be exactly that fraction of a population using a good, and if you think about it, the fraction of the population using a product is not likely to stay exactly the same over time.

  On the other hand, if a there are no people using a product, and the price that people are willing to pay depends on other using the product, then it is not likely for any singular person to start using the product, or if few people use the product, eventually the lack of network effects will cause the product to be worth less and less to them until we are back to 0. Therefore, z = 0 is a stable equilibrium.
