 Hi! I have SDS accommodations but i haven't received an email about where to take my exam. Can someone please reach one to me? I have a linear algebra exam almost directly after at 1pm. If i start taking the exam at 9am like everyone else, that means i will complete the exam at 12:15, since I have 1.5 time. Which will give me 45 minutes before my next exam, which is fine, i just need to know where and when i'm taking it. Thank you so much!
</p>

  I'd email the professors directly right away - they asked in lecture a couple times that anyone with SDS who hadn't received an email go talk to them, so not sure what can be done now, but always worth a shot
