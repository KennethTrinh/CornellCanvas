  Is route 3 still a possible route?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Can a Nash equilibrium be found when there is some route that is still worse than all routes and some travelers will need to take it for all of the other routes to find a balance? For project 2, it seems that AB will always be worse than the other routes, but for a balance to be reached, some travelers will need to take it. Thank you!

  Not quite sure what Route 3 is here...and if some travelers would still prefer to take it in a Nash Equilibrium, then it can't be a worse route than all others (or else they would switch to the better route)
