 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 I'm a bit iffy bout predicting trends of some z fraction of potential users when compared to equilibrium in network effects situation.
</p>
<p>
 <break>
 </break>
 So let say equilibrium values are 0, .4 and .6. (like on the practice final)
</p>
<p>
 If some z is less than .4, is the trend that z will eventually die out since fraction of users who thinks ppl are buying &lt; who are actually buy it
</p>
<p>
 If some z is between .4 and .6, is the trend that it will explode in popularity because fraction of users who think ppl buying &gt; who are actually buying OR will it explode if less than midpoint ( .5 )and die down to .6 if z is greater than the midpoint (.5).
</p>
<p>
 If some z is greater than .6, what is the predicted trend ? will it consolidate at .6 ? This is the one i was very iffy on
</p>

  It will die down to .6, assuming we have a decreasing r(x) with x (like 1-x) and increasing f(z) with z (like 4z). This is because the person z will not buy the product at the current price if he believes z fraction are using it, because f(z)*r(z)&lt;p. In order to compensate for this, the guess has to decrease until it reaches a self fulfilling equilibrium.

   is this for a z being between [.5,.6] ?

    Nope - also holds for any z &gt; 0.4. If z's in (0.4,0.6), then person z and their near neighbors will want to buy the product( f(z)r(z)&gt;p ), causing usage to increase. Conversely, if z &gt; 0.6, person z will not want to buy the product ( f(z)r(z)&lt;p ), causing usage to decrease. This naturally converges to the equilibrium at z=0.6

     but wouldn't that be after it explodes in popularity? If a z is just slightly bigger than .4. i.e .41 or something, wouldn't it just be past the tipping point and explode due to upwards pressure. Then eventually go to .6

      Exactly - it will increase to 0.6, as will any value in (0.4,0.6)
     </p>
     <p>
      (not sure if you're intending "explode" to have a different meaning than increase - we haven't looked at the rate of increase (just whether it would or not), but being only slightly past the tipping point wouldn't cause it to necessarily increase faster than other values. That would depend more on the exact functions and derivatives, which isn't in scope)
