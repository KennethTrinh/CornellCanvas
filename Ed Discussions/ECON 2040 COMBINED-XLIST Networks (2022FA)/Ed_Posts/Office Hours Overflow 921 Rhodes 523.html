  Hey all, because of office hours overflow in Rhodes 514, we are moving some people to Rhodes 523 at 5PM. There will likely be only one TA present at a time between the two rooms, so check in at Rhodes 514 to see if it is still full. If so, you can move to the overflow room to avoid crowding the hallways. Thanks!
