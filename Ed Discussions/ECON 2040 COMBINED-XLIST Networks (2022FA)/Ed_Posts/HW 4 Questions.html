 1.b
</p>
<p>
 1) Can you add a link to two nodes if there is already a link between them. For example (in Figure 1), can you add a link between nodes 12 and 11 that points in the opposite direction of the node that already exists there.
</p>
<p>
 2
</p>
<p>
 2) In networks like these, how can we determine which node we start the UpdateRule with?
</p>
<p>
 3) Is the question asking: If you run the PageRank Update rule starting from the given value of the most important node (Ex. D = 2/17), are the values for each node the same as the ones in Figure 2?
</p>
<p>
 4.a
</p>
<p>
 4) Is this just asking for the process found in Figures 14.1, 14.2, 14.3, and 14.4 in the textbook. Or is this question asking us to repeat this process twice?

  1. Yes, you may try drawing it in the opposite direction.
 </p>
 <p>
  2. I'm assuming you are asking about which node to start when trying to find the equilibrium set of PageRank values - if this is the case, you can start from any node and use expressions to represent PageRank values of other nodes. As long as you can use this method to calculate the equilibrium set, you should be fine.
 </p>
 <p>
  3. Quote from the question, "say whether the indicated set of numbers forms an equilibrium set of PageRank values under the Basic PageRank Update Rule". It's asking if the indicated set of numbers in Figure 2 forms an equilibrium set.
 </p>
 <p>
  4. Quote from the question, "One round of updates for the hub and authority rule applies the authority update rule using the current hub scores and then applies the hub update rule to the resulting authority scores â€”
  <b>
   so a single round consists of two updates, first to update the authority scores, and then to update the hub scores
  </b>
  ."  Figures 14.1, 14.2, 14.3, and 14.4 do not all belong to the process of updating authority scores and hub scores - so the question is not asking you to repeat this process twice. It asks you to do
  <b>
   two rounds
  </b>
  of updating authority and hub scores, and,
  <b>
   after the two rounds
  </b>
  ,
  <b>
   normalize
  </b>
  your answer.

   For 1, I have a question to clarify "try drawing it in the opposite direction." Can we add a new directed edge between nodes that already have a directed edge in the other direction, making a two-way edge between these nodes? Or are you saying this new edge would replace the existing edge, ending with a one-way edge in the opposite direction?

    Quote from the question, " Suppose you are allowed to add one link to the graph in Figure 1..." So you are adding a new directed edge between nodes instead of replacing the existing edge with a new edge.
