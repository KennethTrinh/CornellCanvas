  The answer key doesn't specify for question 7b on the practice prelim if the outcome is stable. I'm wondering if it is?

  The outcome described would be stable; no node would be better off making a deal with another node (outer nodes have an outside option of 0, and inner nodes have an outside option of 3. In all of these cases, a node switching would decrease from their current outcome)

  Just to make sure I'm getting this, in this case the inner nodes have OO's of 3 because they are all each other's OO's, right? So like for example C and D are B's OO, and since both C and D have $9, B's OO would be $3.
