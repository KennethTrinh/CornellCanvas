  Equilibria can't have negative probabilities (there wouldn't be a reasonable interpretation for what that means)

  to follow up- For example, When the probability for the one of the choice of player A is negative, does this means that there is no mixed Nash equilibrium for player A or does it impact player B mixed Nash equilibrium as well?

  You should think of a Nash equilibrium as a property of both the strategies of player A and player B (neither player would change what they are doing given the other player's strategy). Therefore, if any of the probabilities for a mixed strategy you find are negative, then it isn't valid.
