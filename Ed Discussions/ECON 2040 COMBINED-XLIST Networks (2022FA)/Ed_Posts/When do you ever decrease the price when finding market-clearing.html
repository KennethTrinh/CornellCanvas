  Hi, I'm looking at the steps for finding market-clearing prices. They are the following:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <bold>
   (i) At the start of each round, there is a current set of prices, with the smallest one equal to 0.
  </bold>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <bold>
   (ii) We construct the preferred-seller graph and check whether there is a perfect matching.
  </bold>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <bold>
   (iii) If there is, we’re done: the current prices are market-clearing.
  </bold>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <bold>
   (iv) If not, we find a constricted set of buyers S and their neighbors N(S).
  </bold>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <bold>
   (v) Each seller in N(S) (simultaneously) raises his price by one unit.
  </bold>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <bold>
   (vi) If necessary, we reduce the prices — the same amount is subtracted from each price so that the smallest price becomes zero.
  </bold>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <bold>
   (vii) We now begin the next round of the auction, using these new prices.
  </bold>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Could I please get an example of when we would ever reduce prices (step 6)? Thanks
 </paragraph>

  You decrease the price when it's too large that you get a negative net value for one of the players, which doesn't yield any meaning. By decreasing the price, the overall Energy / value doesn't change, but you will get non negative numbers.
