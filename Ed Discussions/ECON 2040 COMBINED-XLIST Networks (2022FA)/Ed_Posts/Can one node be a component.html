 Can one singular node be a component? For example, a group of 5 nodes all connected to each other but there is a 6th node in the graph not connected to any of the other 5. Does this mean there are two components or one? In class, I think we defined a component of a graph to be an internally connected group of nodes with no edges in or out. I'm assuming this means no, but I just wanted to be sure.

  A component is a set of nodes, all pairs of which are connected, with no edges

  in or out. If a singular node has no edges coming in or out of it, it does meet all the qualifications of being a component. The set of nodes in this case would be a set of 1.

   Would there be a distinction between a "connected component" and a "component?" Or are they just the same thing?
