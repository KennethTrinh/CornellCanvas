 How do I get started on this? I tried testing prices on the graph but was having difficulty. Is there a specific formula to use?

  One option is to brute-force it, but that may lead to difficulty having a better understanding for the second part. Instead, it may be helpful to think about when market-clearing prices occur - what combinations of favorites (a, b, or both) can exist between the buyers to have the market clear? What types of prices will make these happen?
