 I was not able to attend a lecture and feel very behind. What is the best way to recover?

  If you missed just one lecture it is unlikely you have fallen very far behind. You can read the chapter in the textbook corresponding to the lecture, and watch the related EdX videos. You can also come to office hours to ask any questions.
