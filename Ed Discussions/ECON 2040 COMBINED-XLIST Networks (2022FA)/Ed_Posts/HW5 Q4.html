  I'm not sure if I understand your question: what do you mean by "adjusting one bidder's price increases other bidder's price?" Advertisers can only change their own bid (which may be the price that you're referring to?).

 <paragraph>
  Do you mean increasing/decreasing their payoffs under different adjustments of bids? If this is what you meant, then: it would
  <bold>
   not
  </bold>
  be a nash equilibrium if the advertiser adjust their bid and can get higher payoffs with their adjusted bid, because the advertisers have incentive to change.
