 Hi! in this case, is C the weakest and gets 0, or is ACE all the same level of weakness? I wonder for these kinds of questions, how specific do we need to know what each nodes would end up getting?

  The scenario you described above is the case for 1-exchange rule. You may find more information in the Chapter 12.3. I also include a screenshot here for your reference.
