  Really hard to understand without the rest of the question.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, I hypothesize that you found that your best bet from a previous scenario (second-price) was $20, and you are now being introduced to this new one. Previously, you would bid $20 (your value) because the price you paid didn't depend on your bid, so your bid only affected at what price you won.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, however, your bid
  <i>
   does
  </i>
  affect your price; by bidding just below, the seller has effectively turned the auction from a second-price auction into a first-price one. Whatever you bid, you will end up paying your bid - (some small amount). Because of this, we can use the same reasoning as why you wouldn't bid your value in a first-price auction (if you bid your value, then you pay your value, and get no payoff - to get some positive payoff, you must bid somewhere below your value)
