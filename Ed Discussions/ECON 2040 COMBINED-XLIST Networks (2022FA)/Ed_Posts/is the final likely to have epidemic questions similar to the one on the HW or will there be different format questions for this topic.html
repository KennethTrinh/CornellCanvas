  just wondering if we perhaps could have examples of different format questions, since there are a number of possibilities. though this question could equally apply to all the topics on the exam.

  There is the possibility of having epidemic questions of a different format. For example, we can ask you a graph-based infection question or a fact-based question related to the SIR/SIRS model.
