  Social welfare maximizing values of what? Prices? I think some terms are getting thrown around, and it's useful to keep straight what adjectives apply to what. A perfect matching is a mapping (between buyers and items). Welfare maximizing is a quality of a perfect matching. Market-clearing prices case a welfare-maximizing perfect matching in the preferred seller network
