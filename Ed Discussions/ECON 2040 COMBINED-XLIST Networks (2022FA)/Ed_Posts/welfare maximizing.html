 Are social welfare maximizing values a perfect matching? or does it just assign the highest values possible to each buyer regardless if it is the item they want?

  Social welfare maximizing values of what? Prices? I think some terms are getting thrown around, and it's useful to keep straight what adjectives apply to what. A perfect matching is a mapping (between buyers and items). Welfare maximizing is a quality of a perfect matching. Market-clearing prices case a welfare-maximizing perfect matching in the preferred seller network

  Really hard to answer when "it" is unclear what it's referencing. However, you can't assign the highest value without factoring in what buyers want - the highest value a buyer has

  what they want. Or do you mean highest "value" of prices (aka highest price)? In that case, what do you mean by highest "possible"? You also assign prices to items, not buyers.
