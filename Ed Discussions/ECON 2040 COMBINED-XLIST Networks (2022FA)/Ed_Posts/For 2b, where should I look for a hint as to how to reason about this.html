  Without values, I donâ€™t see where the assignment of slots to advertisers can happen. What am I missing?

  Check out #403 to see if that helps. In general, you should try to reason about what values the buyers will report to the search engine as their values for the VCG procedure. Remember that the buyers know their own true values, it is just the search engine that does not know those true values. Buyers will always try to give themselves the best chance of getting the best payoff.
