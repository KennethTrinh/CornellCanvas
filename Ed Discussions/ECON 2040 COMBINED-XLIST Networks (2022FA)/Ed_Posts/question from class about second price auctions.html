  Hi, I was just confused regarding to what the professor said about the matching example we did during class being the same as a second-price auction. It was stated that in a second price auction, the highest value buyer gets the item and pays the second highest value.

  In our matching example, I am confused as to how that was the case.

  Here, how did person 1 pay the second highest value? Here, person 1 pays a price of 5-3 = 2. Wasn't the second highest value for A originally the value of 3 (offered by buyer 2)?

  The price that person 1 paid is 3, it is the payoff that they receive from purchasing that item that is 5 (their value) - 3 (the selling price) = 2 (payoff).
