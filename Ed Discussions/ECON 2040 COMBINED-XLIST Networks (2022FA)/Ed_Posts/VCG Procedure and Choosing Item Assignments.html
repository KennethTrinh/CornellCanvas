 In the textbook, it states that you should "Choose a socially optimal assignment of items to buyers — that is, a perfect matching that maximizes the total valuation of each buyer for what they get" in order to create a matching for the VCG procedure. Just to clarify, is this the same as social welfare maximizing? Or is this more focused on the individual buyers' valuations? Thanks!

  I'm not sure if I understand your question correctly - but in order to maximize social welfare, you'll have to maximize the sum of the players’ payoffs. What do you mean by "individual buyers' valuations"?

   I think this answered my question! Sorry if that was a bit unclear, I think I meant something to do with maximizing individual buyers' payoffs, but I realized that wouldn't make much sense. Thanks!
