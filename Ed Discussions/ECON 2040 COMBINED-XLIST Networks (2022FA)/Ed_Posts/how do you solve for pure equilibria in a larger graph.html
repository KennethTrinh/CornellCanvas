  In this course, we would not ask you to solve for pure equilibria in super large graphs. But there are generally some approaches to them:
 </p>
 <list style="bullet">
  <li>
   <p>
    think about what CANNOT be in the pure equilibria and then solve them by elimination
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    if the graph is too large to be calculated by hand, you may want to use calculator (but of course, you cannot, and do not need to, use this approach to solve the games in this course)
   </p>
  </li>
 </list>
