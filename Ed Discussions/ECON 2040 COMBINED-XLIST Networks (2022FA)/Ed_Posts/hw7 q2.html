<p>
 for hw7 q2, for parts b and c, can we simply find the equilibrium and state that because there is or is not an equilibrium less and greater than 1/4, we have our answer?

  Yes, but good luck doing so - given f(z) is different for different ranges, you would have to consider both ranges separately to find all equilibria (i.e. what the problem already directs you to do!)

   wouldn't it just be like a piecewise graph?
