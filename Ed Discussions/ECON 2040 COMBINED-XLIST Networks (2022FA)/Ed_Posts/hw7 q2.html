  for hw7 q2, for parts b and c, can we simply find the equilibrium and state that because there is or is not an equilibrium less and greater than 1/4, we have our answer?

  Yes, but good luck doing so - given f(z) is different for different ranges, you would have to consider both ranges separately to find all equilibria (i.e. what the problem already directs you to do!)
