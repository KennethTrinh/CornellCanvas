  Why is is not also a self fulfilling expectations equilibrium when good and medium cars are sold? Why do bad cars always have to be sold?

  If there was a expected price where good and medium cars were being sold but not bad cars, that would be impossible because the sellers of bad cars would just go ahead and sell bad cars. You basically arrive at a contradiction.

  For example, in the practice prelim if you imagined only good and medium cars being sold, the buyer's expected value would be 12.5. So at a price between 12 and 12.5, certainly both good and medium cars would be sold, but so would bad cars because the seller values those at 2. So it's impossible for both good and medium cars to be sold at an equilibrium.
