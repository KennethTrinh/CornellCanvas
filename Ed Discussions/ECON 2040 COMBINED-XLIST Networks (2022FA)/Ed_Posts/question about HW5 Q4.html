 For Q4(a) What is the definition of Nash Equilibrium? Does Market Clearing price mean Nash Equilibrium?

  A Nash Equilibrium means that no buyer would benefit from bidding a different value. This does not follow from Market Clearing Prices - in fact, for Question 4, all of these prices are market-clearing (each buyer gets an item), but you can guess from the question that not all of them will be Nash Equilibria. A market can be cleared with a buyer being able to do better by taking a different action

   As a follow up, as a general question, is it possible that a situation like the ones in question 4 has no NEs at all? Like if in the current matching, only one buyer can do better by bidding a different thing, but everyone else can't do better. So if that buyer does bid differently and does better, which makes everyone else do worse than the original case, it still wouldn't be a NE?

    Correct - a matching (along with a set of prices) is not a Nash Equilibria if
    <b>
     ANY
    </b>
    buyer can do better by changing their bid. It is only a NE when none of the buyers have any incentive to switch their bid (they are all bidding a best response to the others' bids)
