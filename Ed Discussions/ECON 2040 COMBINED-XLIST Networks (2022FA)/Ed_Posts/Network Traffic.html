  How do we determine whether or not a route is dominated, or if it will be used in a Nash equilibrium?

  For example, if I have a route that takes 4 hours and another route that takes 5+x/200 hours, then regardless of how many people use the second route, it is always going to be slower since 5 + x/200&gt;4. So choosing the first route is a dominant strategy here.

  To add to the other response, it could also depend on how many people you have. For instance, if there are 400 travelers deciding between two routes; one that take 5 hours, and another that takes x/100 hours. No matter the distribution, the latter will always be shorter (even with all 400 travelers on it), so everyone will choose to take it.

  In general, I think a good rule of thumb is that if two routes start and end at the same place, but one takes less time

  , then the other route is dominated.

  Often times, this will also show up in the math; when trying to calculate equilibria distributions of travelers with routes that are dominated, you usually get unrealistic numbers (such as more travelers than you have or negative travelers traveling on a route). In this case, the first thing to do would be to go back and try to find that dominated route.
