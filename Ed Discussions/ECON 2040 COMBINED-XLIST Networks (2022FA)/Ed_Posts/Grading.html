 I can see a breakdown of how much an assignment contributes to our grade in the syllabus, but I don't know about how that percentage will be converted to a letter grade. Is the class curved? If not, what scale is used to convert a percentage into a grade?

  This class has historically been curved, which is why there are no percentage conversions to letter grades. The way the class is curved changes each semester depending on the performance of the students, so there's no set curve for this semester. Grades are determined at the end of the semester.
