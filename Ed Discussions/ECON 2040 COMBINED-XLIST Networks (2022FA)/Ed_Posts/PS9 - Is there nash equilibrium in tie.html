 In problem 4, there could be a nash equilibrium, but it's a tie. What happens in this scenario? How do players choose from equal payoff strategies?

  It shouldn't matter, as the equilibria are relative to each player's own alternatives. There can be equilibria where both players benefit equally, and equilbria where both players lose*.

 <p>
  *by lose I mean both get low results, not that they 'lose' the game relative to the other player.

   So when the player's alternatives are equal, can both options be considered a Pure Nash equilibrium?

    I'm hesitant to say yes, as that depends on the game/rules/circumstances. Consider choices where both players are more likely to benefit the most.
