  Just to clarify, assuming this player gets the item by paying much more than the value, the player actually "loses" the auction? And "wins" only when the player has a payoff of 0 or more?

  You can think of it that way - it might be easier to think of whether their payoff is positive or negative, but if you wish to define the former as "winning" and the latter as "losing" to help with semantics, that's valid
