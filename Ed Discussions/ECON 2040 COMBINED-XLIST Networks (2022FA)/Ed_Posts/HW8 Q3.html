  In lecture, we learned that q = b/(a+b). However, the payoff matrix was different. How do we incorporate the fact that the off-diagonal payoffs are not (0,0) in this setup? As in, there are still positive payoffs if individuals choose different platforms.

  Think about the essence of calculating payoffs from a matrix - we adopted a similar approach when we studied mixed strategy nash equilibrium.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  And then think about the essence of the equation you referred to. What you want to compare are the payoffs of
  <italic>
   u
  </italic>
  when choosing A and B.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Hence, with these two pieces information, you may just want to compare the calculated payoffs to get the range of neighbors for
  <italic>
   u
  </italic>
  and then confirm the threshold
  <italic>
   q
  </italic>
  .

  How do I compare the payoffs for u? I am confused by the differentiation between x and q. Why would our calculations results in  a range of neighbors for u?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Do I still need to use the q = b / (a+b) formula here? It doesn't really make sense to me to do that, since we can calculate for x, the way we calculated the mixed strategy NE. Or, do we calculate x, plug that back into the payoff formula for a and b, then plug that into q = b/(a+b)?

  Thanks!

  Nope; q=b/(a+b) is a specific case of what's generalized above.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  You know that Player u should choose A if the payoff for A is greater than B. You can reduce this inequality to something of the form
  <code>
   x&gt;c
  </code>
  , indicating that we should choose A if x is above some value c. In this case, this is exactly what we described before with the threshold rule, with c serving the role of q
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  (Our calculations result in a range of neighbors for u because u will choose A for the range of possible neighbors such that
  <code>
   x&gt;c
  </code>
  )
