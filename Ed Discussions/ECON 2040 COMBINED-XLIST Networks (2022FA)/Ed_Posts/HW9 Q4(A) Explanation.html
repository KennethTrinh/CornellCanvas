  Hello,

  I was just looking at the solutions for HW 9 Q4 part a, and I noticed that there were only two pure Nash equilibrium. I remember at the start of the semester when studying game theory that there were only three possible outcomes of a game: one pure, zero pure one mix, and two pure one mixed strategies when two players with two different strategies.

  Also, I wanted some explanation regarding why (Y,Y) was a pure NE for this question because it looks like when Player A chooses strategy Y, Player B's receives the same payoff and vice versa.

  This is an example of a game in which there are only two pure Nash Equilibria and no mixed. It really depends on the payoffs/setup of the game, so it is worth it to check for both pure and mixed if asked. There are examples in which we analyze mixed strategies and ESS (see chapter 7.5 in the book.

  We call (Y,Y) weakly dominated strategies (because of the equivalent payoff that you mention). However, this does not exclude it from being a pure strategy Nash Equilibrium. Check out chapter 6 pg 192 and the Stag Hunt game for an example of this (
