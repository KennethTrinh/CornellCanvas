 Most question in HW5 except question 4 do not require explanation but just require the assignment of slots or prices advertiser pay. So, it means as long as we get the value or assignment of slots correct, no point will be deducted because we do not need to explain for most of the question.

  Obv not a course staff, so I can't say anything definite, but I would be cautious - not needing to show your work is only specified for 2a, not for the rest, so it may not hold. Showing work is usually a good idea though - it lets you get partial credit/show the grader your thinking, and if you're doing the work anyway to get the answer, why not include it?
