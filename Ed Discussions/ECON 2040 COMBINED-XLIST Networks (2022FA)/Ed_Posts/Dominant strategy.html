 For a strategy to be dominant, do all of its payoffs have to be the largest one or can it just be mostly dominant with the exception of one strategy for instance?

  Player 1's dominant strategy has to be the best strategy against
  <i>
   all
  </i>
  of Player 2's options, being either the largest payoff or equal to any of Player 1's other options. (

  dominant strategies mean strictly largest, not allowing equal/indifferent comparisons.)
