 Does normalization happen only after we are finished with both rounds of hub-authority updates, or should we normalize after each round (e.g. perform one round, normalize, then perform another round and normalize)?

  For this problem, normalization occurs after each round (the problem states that "Recall also that computing hub and authority values involves a final normalization step", so each time you compute hub and authority scores, you should normalize after)
 </p>
 <p>
  As an aside, it shouldn't affect your final outcome

   I agree that it doesn't affect the final outcome, but was curious about the specifics of what is expected since the question's wording is somewhat ambiguous. I interpreted it the same way as you initially, but the textbook seems to define the algorithm to only normalize at the very end so I wasn't sure.

    Yeah - I think for this problem, they want normalization at every step (certainly couldn't hurt :) )
