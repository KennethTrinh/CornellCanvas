  We can think of this from the insurance companies point of view. Suppose they think that only high-risk buyers are going to be purchasing insurance. Then, the expected cost of insurance to the insurance company is (1/1) * 12,000 = 12,000.
 </p>
 <p>
  Given this, the health insurance company is willing to sell health insurance at a price that is at or above the expected cost (12,000) and high-risk people are willing to buy the health insurance at a price that is at most 16,000. Note that low and medium risk people will not buy insurance as their values for insurance are far below the price of 12,000 that the seller set.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, we have an equilibrium where the insurance company thinks that only high-risk people will buy insurance and only high-risk people buy insurance at a price between $12,000-16,000.

   Okay thank you! That makes sense. If the roles were switched, and the buyer expects that only the high-quality item will be sold (and expects the cost to equal $12,000), then it would never be an equilibrium right? Because then, the sellers with medium and low-quality items would also want to sell their items at $12,000.
