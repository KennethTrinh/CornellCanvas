  Hi, could someone explain 8a -- why would you bid less than your actual valuation?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  And for 8c -- Is the correct logic: you would not bid your value is because of the discount, and so you would want to bid a value such that your bid, with the discount, is equal to your valuation?

  8a) This is essentially the same as a first-price auction (you pay what you bid), where we know that it is never a dominant strategy to bid at your value or above. This is because if you bid your value, supposing you win, you would then have to pay your value, making your payoff zero (and not winning also gets you zero payoff). The only way to get a positive payoff (what you desire) is to bid less than your value so that your payoff (value-price paid) is positive

  8c) Nope, not quite - if you bid such that you pay your value, you'd run into the same problem above that your payoff is always zero. The logic is that a lower bid would increase your payoff, but reduce your chances of winning. How much would it reduce your chances

    depends on what the other bidders bid

  . Given that your optimal bid depends on what other bidders are doing, you will never have a dominant strategy (as a dominant strategy has to be a best response to every possible action others could take)

  To explain this a bit further: imagine there is an item up for auction where you have a value of 5. If everyone else is bidding 1, then you would want to bid slightly higher than 1, as to maximize your payoff. If everyone else bids 2, you bid slightly higher than 2, and so on...your best bid depends on what others do, so there is no bid that is a dominant strategy

  Hi! for 8d - do you mind explaining further why is the bid dependent on other people's bids? Say you bid 5 and your value is 5, you pay 5*(1 - the percentage d), so your payoff is 5*the percentage d. Thus, isn't your payoff highly dependent on the percentage?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If you are personally happy with 5*percentage, you should bid; so it's more about where your satisfaction lies?

  Correct - you'd still get some payoff bidding your value, but you want to bid to maximize your payoff. If everyone else bids 1, then you'd get a better payoff bidding just above 1. However, if everyone bids 2, then this strategy wouldn't work. In this sense, your payoff-maximizing bid (a.k.a. the one you should make) depends on what others bid - bidding your value isn't a best response to every scenario. Hope this helps!
