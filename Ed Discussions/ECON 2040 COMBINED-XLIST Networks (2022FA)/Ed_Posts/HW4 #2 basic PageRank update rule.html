 For question 2 and when doing the basic PageRank update rule, does the node's value have to split evenly or can they just split in a way that adds up to the original value?
</p>
<p>
 For example, if node A's value is 3/4, and it has 2 outgoing nodes, B and C, with values 1/4 and 2/4, would this still be in equilibrium? Or does it need to be evenly split into 3/8 and 3/8?

  It splits evenly, so if a node E has two outgoing nodes (children) Z and S, Z gets half and S gets half.

   So if they don't split evenly, say one child gets all the value and the other none, would that mean the network is not in equilibrium?

    The edges coming out of a node always have to be equal. However, the nodes they lead to don't necessarily have to be in an equilibrium (specifically in the case where they get PageRank from other edges/nodes)
