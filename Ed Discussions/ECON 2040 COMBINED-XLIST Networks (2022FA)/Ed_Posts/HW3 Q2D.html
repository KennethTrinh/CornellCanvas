 Because it is a posted price style and not a second price auction if a buyer were to value the item at 15, would they still try to buy the item even if its posted price is 5?
</p>
<p>
 Post #155 says yes, while post #189 says no
</p>
<p>
 Am I to assume that if the buyer's value for the item is above the posted price they will not try and buy the item because it is not precisely the posted price, and vice versa if it is lower?

  To clarify from post #189: If you value an item at 15, and the price is 5, you
  <b>
   WOULD
  </b>
  buy it at the posted price. That post was saying that you wouldn't buy it above the posted price; if your value is 15, you would still prefer to pay 5 rather than 15 for the item

   If a buyer values an item at 15, then they would benefit from paying any price less than 15. That should help you reason through the problem.
