  it sounds like if I win an auction I then have to pay the value of what somebody else would’ve paid if I wasn’t there

  Somewhat - you have to pay the difference of what happens if you are and aren't there.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Imagine you and your sibling are trying to decide who gets what toy. You have two options - a nice Thomas the Tank Engine set (let me tell you, that was hot stuff when I was 5), and an ok-ish teddy bear. Let's say you, being the older sibling, get the train set, leaving your sibling with the teddy bear. Your sibling would prefer to have the train set, but because you're there, they're left getting the teddy bear. Therefore, the "harm" you inflict on your sibling is the decrease in value they get due to your presence - in this case, their value for the train set minus their value for the teddy bear. Some version of logic says that this "harm" is what you should have to pay to compensate for taking that value away from your sibling - this is what VCG does.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  This is the same thing in matching markets. Often, there's an item that multiple people want (have the most value for), but only one person can get. That person's presence means that the value all the other buyers get could be lesser. The VCG algorithm states that we should charge each person the "harm" they inflict on the rest of the buyers from taking that item. For a given Buyer X, compare the value the other buyers get without X present, versus the value they get with X present. The difference is the "harm" X causes, and is what we should charge X for the VCG algorithm.

  So if I was to take both the train and the teddy bear then I would have to comp my sibling for the value of both, but because I am leaving the teddy bear I subtract that from the “harm“ I’m compensating for

  Right track?

  (Edit: if your sibling was allowed to take both the train set and the teddy bear, you would be correct (essentially, you could view them as one item with the combined value) - sorry if I misunderstood the question)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>

 <paragraph>
  Not quite! We assume that you can only take one item, so I'm not sure if this is too relevant to what we do. However, we can see that in this case:
 </paragraph>
 <list style="bullet">
 </list>
 <list style="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    If you're not present, your sibling gets the train set - has the value of the train set
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    If you're present, your sibling gets nothing - no value
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
 </list>
 <paragraph>
  Therefore, the difference is only the value of the train set, NOT both. The "harm" is the difference of the two scenarios. In your proposed scenario, it would be the same as if the teddy bear didn't exist - it's never a relevant option, as your sibling would either get the train set or nothing. This somewhat applies to our problems as well - if an item was never the best option for a buyer, then the outcome and "harm" would be the same as if it never existed
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  This is why the buyer with the lowest value slot for the web search always gets it for 0 - their presence/taking it never inflicts any "harm", as none of the other buyers would choose it in either scenario
