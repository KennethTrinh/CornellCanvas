 Hi, I wanted to clarify some confusion on Q6b and correct some things I said during OH. The question states that "any perfect matching determined by a set of market-clearing prices must be welfare-maximizing". What this really means is that IF we ran the matching algorithm in chapter 10, we are guaranteed to get a matching that is welfare maximizing.
</p>
<p>
 However, there also exist perfect matchings that can be constructed without using the algorithm in chapter 10. In this case, since you are not constructing the matching through the algorithm you cannot guarantee that your matching is always welfare maximizing.
</p>
<p>
 The question asks you to construct an example where a matching can either be welfare maximizing OR baseline maximizing, but cannot be both. I said something wrong during OH and  I hope this clears up some confusion I might have caused. Thanks

  Does a perfect matching have to occur when values are the highest? Or can perfect matches be constructed with buyers and items that are not their preferred choice as long as there is no constricted set?

   According to the book:
  </p>
  <p>
   When there are an equal number of nodes on each side of a bipartite graph, a perfect matching is an assignment of nodes on the left to nodes on the right, in such a way that (i) each node is connected by an edge to the node it is assigned to, and (ii) no two nodes on the left are assigned to the same node on the right.
  </p>
  <p>
   So no, a perfect matching does not have to occur when values are the highest
