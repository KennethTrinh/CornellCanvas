  Hello,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  In class yesterday Professor Easley said that next week we will be studying Matching Markets from Chapter 10 of the textbook. Does this correspond to the EdX videos titled "Introduction to Matching Markets" under "Module Three: Matching Markets"? Will the "Bargaining on Networks" videos also be covered in lecture next week?
