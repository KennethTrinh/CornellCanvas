  Is bidding your true value always a dominant strategy in any auction? I know it is for second-price, sealed-bid auctions but not sure if it's true when it's not second-price or not a sealed-bid, or when other bidders are not bidding their true value.

  Nope, it's not! The main case to highlight this is the first price auction (you pay what you bid). In this case, if you lose, you get zero payoff, and if you win, your payoff (value - price you paid) is also zero. In this scenario, bidding our value always results in a net zero payoff, and we'd do better to bid below (to have a chance at a positive payoff), so we shouldn't bid our value in this case (see #254)
