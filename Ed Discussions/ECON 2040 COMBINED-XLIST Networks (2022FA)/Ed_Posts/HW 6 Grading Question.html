  Hello,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For HW6, I saw on Gradescope that questions 2 and 3 are only worth 2 points each, but on the handout it looks like their worth 7 points. Is the gradescope version accurate, or the handout?

  The version on Gradescope has been changed. Problem 2 and 3 are each 7 points.
