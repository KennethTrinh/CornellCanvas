  I was just wondering -- the students living on each floor would technically satisfy the STC with the other 19 students living on their floor, as they all have strong ties with one another. However, they might violate the STC with students living on other floors -- does this mean that they can no longer satisfy the STC at all, even with the other students living on their own floor?

  STC is either satisfied or violated. Two conditions have to be met in order for a student to violate STC.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  [1] The student has at least 2 strong ties.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  [2] The student has at least one pair of strong ties with other students despite those other two students not having any tie with each other.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Even though a student might have 19 strong ties with other students on a floor, if there's one instance in which the student has ties that would violate STC, such as with other students on different floors, then they can no longer satisfy STC.

  Using this logic, is there only one node that satisfies STC in question 3C?

  Any node that meets the two conditions I stated above would
  <bold>
   violate
  </bold>
  STC. Any node that doesn't meet the two conditions above would
  <bold>
   satisfy
  </bold>
  STC.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For question 3C, if all but one node meet the two conditions above, then all but one node would violate STC, and hence, only one node would satisfy STC.

  This explanation is not to confirm whether your answer is correct or not, just to explain a way to approach this.

  Do you mean that if all but one node violates STC, then all the other nodes would satisfy STC? It doesn't make sense to me that if only one node violates STC, then that somehow means that only one node satisfies STC

  If there are 10 nodes in a network, and 9 of them violate STC, then that would leave 1 node that does not violate STC.
