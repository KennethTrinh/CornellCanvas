 Question. Is it a fact that if reservation price is greater than actual price, the population is likely to reach z"?

  "Second equilibrium" and z'' don't generalize well if there's more equilibria than we've seen previously. However, I think your intuition is correct; if reservation price &gt; actual price, then the consumers around our current
  <code>
   z
  </code>
  want to buy as well, meaning that over time, the number of consumers that buy will increase (naturally, until this relation becomes false, which would occur at an equilibria)
