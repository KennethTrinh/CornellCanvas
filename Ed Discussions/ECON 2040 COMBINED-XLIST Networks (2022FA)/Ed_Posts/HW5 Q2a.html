 Does the answer have to be the result of running the algorithm shown in class, or can we use any market clearing price set?

  Aidan is correct - 2a only asks for some set of market clearing prices, while in 2b you must use the VCG Procedure to find a specific set of prices.

   From my interpretation, any set of market-clearing prices would be sufficient (they don't specify anything beyond market-clearing). However, it may be easiest to obtain these with the method from class, just for your own sake
