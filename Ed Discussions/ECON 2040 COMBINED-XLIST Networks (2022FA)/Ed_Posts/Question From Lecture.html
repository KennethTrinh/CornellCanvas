 I remember that someone asked Professor Kleinberg if $P(\neg A | B) = 1-P(A|B)$. Professor Kleinberg gave the example of someone eating breakfast and the weather being a counterexample. Clearly, the weather and someone's breakfast are independent. However, if $A$ and $B$ are dependent, and $P(A) + P(B) = 1$, does $P(\neg A | B) = 1-P(A|B)$ hold? Feel free to provide counterexamples if any exist. I'd appreciate any intuition behind your answer as well.

  Hi yes I was the one who asked the question. Checking my notes, it seems that the original question was if $\Pr[B|\neg A] = \neg\Pr[B|A]$, as that was true in some of the examples that we were given (but apparently it isn't true in general).

   Ah okay I guess I misremembered that then. I think I should be correct then. Thanks
