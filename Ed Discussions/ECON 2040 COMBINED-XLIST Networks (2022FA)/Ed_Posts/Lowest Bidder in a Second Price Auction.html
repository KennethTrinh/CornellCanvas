  How much does the lowest bidder pay in a second price auction?
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 I understand that in general, the i-th buyer pays the (i+1)-th bid, but the when the final spot is reached, there is no (i+1)-th buyer...

  From Question 4:
 </p>
 <p>
  "the advertiser with the third highest bid per click gets the third slot (c) and pays 0 per click for slot (as there is no lower bid) "

   For the generalized second price auction, the lowest bidder will get the worst "item/slot" at a price of 0.
