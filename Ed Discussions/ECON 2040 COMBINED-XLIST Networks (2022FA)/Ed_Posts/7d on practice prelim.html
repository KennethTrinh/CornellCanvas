  Hard to help with just "I do not understand" - anything specific? This is the graph, in case it helps:

  Aidan thank you for helping us so late. Really appreciate it.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I also had a question for this. I understand that A, E, and F become weaker because their only neighbor B is very powerful now. C and D also become weaker because B is more powerful now. B is very powerful because it has 3 very weak neighbors. Is this a good enough explanation?
 </paragraph>

 <paragraph>
  Questions:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1. Do the edges still have $12 where B, C, D have $8 and A, E and F have $4 (from 7c)?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. How to show that the network is balanced?

  The only issue I can see with your explanation is a little bit of circular logic (A/E/F are weak because B is strong, B is strong because A/E/F are weak) - it may be easiest to start with why A/E/F are weak (they are all held "captive" by B, and can only ever do a trade with B)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1) Nope (an immediate observation is that A, E, and F can't all get something, as B can only do a deal with one of them) - you have to analyze the re-structured network separately from before. Your analysis of power may provide a good starting place - see #266
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2) You have to show that for each deal being made, each node is getting their outside option plus half of the surplus
