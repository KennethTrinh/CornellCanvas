  Hello! I might have missed a prior announcement, but have midterm grades been released? I remember that a previous thread mentioned that they'd be posted before the weekend and the upcoming drop deadline, just wanted an updated on that. Thank you!

  The midterm grades have not been posted yet, but will be finalized and posted soon. The grades will be posted before the drop deadline so you will be able to take your grade into consideration when deciding to drop the course or not.
