 On edX, there are examples of traffic problems with toll roads. Because we never covered this in class, is it safe to say that we won't be tested on it?

  Not course staff, so no clue, but I think it could be, given what we've done. If you're given a way to fold in a toll into a driver's payoff (along with their travel time - for example, if each driver equated having to pay $10 as the same as travelling for an hour), you could formulate a payoff for a driver taking either road, and we know how to handle those from class. While not explicitly covered, I could imagine it coming up as a problem to see whether you can adapt and understand the ideas behind the material from lecture
