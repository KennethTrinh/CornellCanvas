 If we are doing math or scratch work or writing things out to better understand, is it okay if thats hand written if our final answer is typed? Or should we type up the the math/scratch work/notes in addition to our final answer/explanations?

  Hi! Thanks for your question. Your final answer and any explanations requested in the prompt should be typed,  but scratch work and figures/graphs may be handwritten, provided that the handwritten work is supplementary and not complementary. In other words, as long as all answers and explanations that the problem set asks for are typed, you may absolutely submit your scratch work.
 </p>
