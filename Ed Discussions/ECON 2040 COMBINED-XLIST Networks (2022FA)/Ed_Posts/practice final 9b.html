 What would be a sufficient explanation for why we can't tell what voter 3's ranking is? The answers just say there are several possibilities and lists a few of them. If I show math for different rankings and show there are more than one ranking possibility, would that be enough?

  Yes, if there are multiple rankings that explain the outcome, that means we can't be sure what the ranking was
