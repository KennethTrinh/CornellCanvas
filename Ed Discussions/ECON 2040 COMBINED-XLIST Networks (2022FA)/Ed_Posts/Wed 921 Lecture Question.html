  In lecture today (Wed, 9/21), Professor Kleinberg discussed a T-shaped network (A connected B; B connected A, C, D; C connected to B; D connected to B, E; and E connected to D.).
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  We were asked what the relative levels of power would be, considering the specific experimental method he discussed.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The answer was:
  <bold>
   B &gt; D, E &gt; A, C.
  </bold>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I didn't quite understand the logic behind the statement: B is not  a useful option for D, so D has no real reason to exclude E.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Could someone help clarify this point?

  B has a significant power advantage over A and C, so it doesnâ€™t benefit from negotiating with D unless D gets very little. However, D has no reason to negotiate for very little because it can get close to an even split with E.
