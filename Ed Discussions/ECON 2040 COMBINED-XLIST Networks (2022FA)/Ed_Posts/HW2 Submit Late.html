 Hello. I had some upload and connection issues last second when submitting HW2 (pages showed as selected when there was nothing selected error), which resulted in 10 minutes submission late. Will I still get railed with the 20% penalty?

  Got it. We won't deduct the 20 percent in this case. (In general, however, I would recommend trying to give yourself a buffer.)
