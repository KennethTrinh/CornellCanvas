  Hi! I was considering filing a regrade request, but figured I might bring it up on Ed first --

  Post #36 (
  <link href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/24349/discussion/1710283"/>
  https://edstem.org/us/courses/24349/discussion/1710283) references this, but initially a TA had replied saying that we should consider a node being "removed" to mean that it becomes a separate component (the response has since been edited) - I changed my pset solution to this, and then ended up losing points (as I didn't see a correction on this post until just today). I'm not sure if this warrants a regrade, but I'm assuming I wasn't the only one with this problem because of this post. I think going forward, it might be really helpful to have Ed announcements if anyone might need to go back on a prior answer just so we can avoid any similar situations! Thank you!!

  Hi, I was the person who originally made post #36 and also got points off after going with the TA's original response. I'm wondering if it's possible to get points back for this since I was given false information and was not aware that a correction had been made?
