 Can an scc only have 1 set of equilibrium PageRank values?

  Yes - due to the interconnected nature, if one node has more than it "should" have at equilibrium, then it will contribute more than it "should" to other nodes, causing them to deviate as well, until equilibrium is later reached
 </p>
 <p>
  (Note that this doesn't hold for non-SCC's - consider 3 non-connected nodes, where any distribution of PageRank is an equilibria)
