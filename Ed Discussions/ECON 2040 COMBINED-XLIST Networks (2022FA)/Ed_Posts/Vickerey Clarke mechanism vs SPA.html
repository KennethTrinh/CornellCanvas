  Does the Vickerey Clarke Mechanism and Second Price Auction yield the same results?? I believe that Professor Easley said that the VCG gives the same values as a SPA as mentioned in lecture notes October 17th but Professor Kleinberg showed the Generalized SPA yields a different value than the VCG in the October 19th lecture so I am having trouble in understanding the relation between VCG and SPA.

  Both VCG and the Generalized Second Price Auction will yield the same matching in the case of a Single Unit (making them "like" SPA). However, VCG will charge different prices. The reason we use VCG instead of the Generalized Second Price Auction when transitioning to multiple units is that it successfully ensures that truthful bidding is a dominant strategy, whereas GSPA does not
