  I am a bit confused on my intuition on how to do parts c, d and e for question 10.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For c, they ask how should the first person make a decision. Intuitively speaking, if they get a low signal, they should reject and if they get a high signal, they should adopt the tech.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For d, considering that the first person adopted, the second person should also adopt when they get a high signal. However, if the signal is different (low), then they should reject as they have greater trust in their own signal.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For e, considering that the first and second person adopted, the third person should adopt in either case of low or high signal. This is because most people at this point got high signals.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Is my understanding correct?
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  Moreover, how would I do this and set it up mathematically? The question gave 1, 0 or -1 payoff for either accepting the good tech, rejecting it, or accepting a bad one. Please help.

  c) Yes - it is because the probability of a good state is greater for a high signal, and a bad state is higher for a low signal
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  d) Yes (we determine that you go with your own signal in the event of equal probability, which can be calculated with Bayes' Rule, as we need to factor in the fact that the previous person got a high signal)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  d) Yup (looking at the conditional probability with Bayes Rule, we can see that in either case (high or low signal), a good state is still more likely)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Looks like your understanding is correct! Hopefully the comments gave some paths of how you might use formulae to show this?

  Thank you. That helped a lot.

  For part d, when finding the probability of Pr(G|HH), how would I set it up mathematically? What does the set up of HH look like or even HHH?

  So adoption is dependent on the conditional probability a signal denotes something as good or bad?

  Yes - they adopt or reject based on whether a good or bad state is more likely, the probability of which is conditional on the signal they receive
