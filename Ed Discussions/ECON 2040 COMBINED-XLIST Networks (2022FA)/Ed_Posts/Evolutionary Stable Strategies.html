  How exactly do you calculate it for both strategies? An example, where each pairing had different values, would be helpful, as all the models we have been provided use the same numbers making it difficult to know where each value was pulled from.

  If you wish, there are two examples on the slides from 11/16 that use different numbers. The general idea is that a strategy is ESS if, when a large majority of others adopt that strategy (a fraction 1-x for small x) and a small number adopt the other, the given strategy is the best response. You can just calculate the payoffs using those percentages, and come to conclusions by comparing your outcomes (remembering that x is small but still exists)
