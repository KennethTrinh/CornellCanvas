  In question 1a, is the city being fully removed from the graph, or simply detached from it? In other words, should we interpret that the city/ node being "removed" is still somewhere in the graph as its own component with no edges to or from it, or is it being completely removed from the picture?

  My apologies - we are removing the node from the graph. It should not be considered a separate component
