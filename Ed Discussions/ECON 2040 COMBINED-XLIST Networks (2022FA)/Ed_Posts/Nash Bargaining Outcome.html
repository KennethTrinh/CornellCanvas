  The Nash bargaining outcome is meant to represent what each member in a bargaining network "should" get, based on their power in the network (and is used to help demonstrate power; the higher outcome, the more power you have). In reality, the ultimatum game showed that some people would rather walk away from low payoffs (simply to avoid feeling taken advantage of by someone with more power in the network), but the Nash Bargaining Outcome neglects this, and tries to determine, based on the power of everyone in the network, what "should" the result be if everyone wants to maximize their payoff
