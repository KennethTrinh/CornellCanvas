  In this example, is D a strictly dominated strategy? It's never the best response, but it is not beaten by a single alternative in all cases.

  D would still be a dominated strategy - even though the same strategy doesn't beat it in all cases,
  <italic>
   it is still beaten by another strategy, no matter what the other player does
  </italic>
  (the key determinant in a strategy being strictly dominated). In other words, it is never a best response
