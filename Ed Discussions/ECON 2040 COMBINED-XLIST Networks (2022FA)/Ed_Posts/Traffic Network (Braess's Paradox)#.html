 Hi! I saw someone just asked something similar but I also wanted to ask this example in the video. What's the procedure you get nash equilbirum (how do you know ACDB is strictly dominant) in this case?

  In this example, the creation of a 0 minute C-D road essentially splits problem into two decisions for drivers.
 </p>
 <p>
  1. what is the best way to get to from A to C/D?
 </p>
 <p>
  2. what is the best way to get from C/D to B?
 </p>
 <p>
  Note that this is possible because drivers can switch between C and D without time cost.
 </p>
 <p>
  1. If all the cars in this problem (500) went on the road A-C, the time it would take is 50 minutes. If we compare it to the constant road A-D (55 min), we can see that the A-C road is always preferable.
 </p>
 <p>
  2. Using similar logic, we can compare the time for all drivers taking D-B with the time it takes to get from C-B (55 min). Since drivers are self-interested, they will always go for the route that will be faster for them (D-B).
 </p>
 <p>
  This gives the dominant strategy of ACDB.

   If it is a dominant strategy, is the equilibrium now: ACDB = 500 ACB = 0 ADB = 0?

    Yes, although you could also give the equilibrium in terms of x and y in a similar fashion.

     Using the  same approach in this graph:
    </p>
    <p>
     Equilibrium without the 0 min bridge: x = 300, y=200
    </p>
    <p>
     1. what is the best way to get to from A to C/D? (300/100) = 3 &gt;2, so AD
    </p>
    <p>
     2. what is the best way to get from C/D to B? (200/100) = 2 &gt; 0+1, so CB
    </p>
    <p>
     What does this approach of dividing the graph in parts tell me? Does it tell me the equilibrium? When should I do it this way?
    </p>

      So, in this graph, we know that taking the A-C route means that we must spend 1 hour travelling from C-B as we cannot switch to D. We already know that drivers can get to B in 3 hours, so x/100 must be less than or equal to 2 hours. That means that some drivers will arrive at node D.
     </p>
     <p>
      Further, we know that every driver that arrives at D can already get to B in 1 hour (through C). Thus, y/100 must be less than or equal 1 hr. If this y path is less than an hour, than people start to take to the y route more, leading to an increase in time until it is equivalent to the time the C-B takes. We can solve for y and make a similar argument to solve for x.
     </p>

      Unfortunately, there is no definitive answer to when we can split up the problem into two sections like the original question. If there is a
      <i>
       bidirectional
      </i>
      0 length C-D road in a simple 4 node diamond-like structure, we are pretty certain we can split up the graph. In other cases, we might have to run some analysis like the one we did above.
