  Do you have any suggestions on completing the pre lecture readings more efficiently? The readings take me hours at a time to finish and was wondering if there was a more concise method that still covers the same material. Would watching the videos be faster?

  The videos go over the fundamental ideas of the topics well, while the textbook goes a lot more in depth in both applications of topics and problem solving. I would say that reading the textbook is helpful especially if you're having difficulty with a certain topic or stuck on a certain problem on a problem set. Both the videos and textbook readings are helpful on understanding the content, but it's fine to take less time on readings as long as you're still able to follow along in lecture and problem sets.

  If you're spending a lot of time reading the textbook in order to understand the course content, the Cornell Learning Strategies Center has tips on effectively reading textbook chapters and taking notes here:

  I find that using a text-to-speech extension such as
  <link href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/use-immersive-reader-on-w/fmidkjgknpkbmninbmklhcgaalfalbdh?hl=en-US"/>
  Immersive Reader or the built-in Read Aloud option for PDFs on Microsoft Edge is helpful for the readings.
