  Hi, are there any sources that we can find to interpret the min(1, 4z) part of question 2 of Pset 7? I know how to do the problem in general but I'm having a hard time factoring this part into it.

  Think about how the function f(z) = min(1,4z) behaves when z = 1/4 (in part a), z&lt;1/4 (in part b), and z &gt; 1/4 (part c).

  Does min imply to find the minimum of the two numbers?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If z = 1/4, do we say that f(z) = 1?

  Yes, the min implies that the output of the function is the minimum between 1 and 4z. You can plug it into desmos or something similar to see what it looks like graphically.
