  For Figure 1 in Q4, does node j linking to node i also implies links to the nodes that node i is linked to?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For example, in graph (a), does node 5 linking to node 4 implies links to nodes 3 and 1? Or, if the arrow is not visualized in the graph, there is no link (direct or indirect) between them?

  if 5 links to 4, then there is no direct link from 5 to 1 and 3
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  there is a difference between [links to a node] and [links to the nodes the node links to]

  Yes, but then can we assume there are indirect links from 5 to 1 and 3?

  This problem (and the process) don't need or use a notion of "indirect links"; we only care about the actual links present

  I mean technically u can click 5 to reach 4, then click links on 4 to reach 1 or 3.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  but for the problem, you shouldn't consider this as having a link from 5 to 1
