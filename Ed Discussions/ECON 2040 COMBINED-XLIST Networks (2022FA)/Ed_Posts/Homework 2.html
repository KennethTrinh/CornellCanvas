  Solutions from now on can either be handwritten or typed. Here's the Canvas announcement we made earlier:
 </p>
 <p>
  -----------
 </p>
 <p>
  At this point we allow both typed and handwritten homework assignments. If you submit a handwritten assignment be sure that it is legible; we won't grade answers that we can't read. Typed assignments are better. Attached is a latex framework that you can use to get started on typing your homework. The example latex file uses a package (sgame) to create a game matrix, contains an example of embedding a figure (XX-figure.pdf, a place holder for a figure you create) in the pdf it generates, and contains an example of how to create simple table.
 </p>
 <p>
  An easy place to get started with latex is
  <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/">

   which is a free, online LaTeX editor.

    Are we allowed to type our homework not using overleaf (google docs or microsoft word)? Overleaf keeps on bugging for  me and I am also not familiar with it.

     Yes, feel free to use either. (Also, happy to help you with overleaf, for example at my office hours Thurs 10am-11. It could be a worthwhile investment to learn.)
