  Solutions from now on can either be handwritten or typed. Here's the Canvas announcement we made earlier:

 <paragraph>
  At this point we allow both typed and handwritten homework assignments. If you submit a handwritten assignment be sure that it is legible; we won't grade answers that we can't read. Typed assignments are better. Attached is a latex framework that you can use to get started on typing your homework. The example latex file uses a package (sgame) to create a game matrix, contains an example of embedding a figure (XX-figure.pdf, a place holder for a figure you create) in the pdf it generates, and contains an example of how to create simple table.

  An easy place to get started with latex is

  Are we allowed to type our homework not using overleaf (google docs or microsoft word)? Overleaf keeps on bugging for  me and I am also not familiar with it.

  Yes, feel free to use either. (Also, happy to help you with overleaf, for example at my office hours Thurs 10am-11. It could be a worthwhile investment to learn.)
