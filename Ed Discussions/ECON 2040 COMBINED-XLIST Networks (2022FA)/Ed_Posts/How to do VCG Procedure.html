 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 I don't really understand how to do the VCG procedure for one item with multiple buyers. Can someone explain the steps?

  The description of HW5 1b gives a bit of setup of how to deal with one item and multiple buyers. You can create "fictional" items of value 0 that are assigned to the remaining buyers who didn't get the one item. Then, calculate harm as you would normally do so in the VCG procedure. (You will find that some components are 0, since several buyers are getting a "fictional" item of value 0.)

   The steps are in the notes, as well as explained in detail on page 448 of the textbook. For an intuitive reasoning, you might see

   . Any question in particular?
