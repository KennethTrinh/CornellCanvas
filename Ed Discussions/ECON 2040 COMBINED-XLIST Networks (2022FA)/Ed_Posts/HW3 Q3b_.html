  Hi!
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I'm just a little confused and looking for some clarification on HW3 problem 3 part b.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  When looking at this new route, it tells us that there's now a route that takes travelers from A to E, E to C, and E to B.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I'm a little confused on where the highway from E to C comes in? I was going off of #156 that we're not replacing/changing any routes from the original two, but don't see how the route between E and C connects to the first or latter part of this new route since A goes straight to E, which then goes to B.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thanks!

  You're correct that there is now a new path A-&gt;E-&gt;B which gets you to the final destination. The incorporation of the (two-way) E-C edge of 0 hours of travel provides a new path for those who are currently at E (or C) and might want to switch paths in case it's faster. Now, instead of 3 "two-edge-long" paths from A to B, there is a possibility to take another route halfway through.
