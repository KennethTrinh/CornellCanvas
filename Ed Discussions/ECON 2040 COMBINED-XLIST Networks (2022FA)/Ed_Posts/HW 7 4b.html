  For 4b, I just want to clarify - we don't need to use math complete it right? Right now I am reasoning that we can look at a certain graph and see that there is a somewhat equal chance of directly linking vs imitating, while in another graph there are only direct links.

  From the question: "you donâ€™t need to provide actual probabilities" - not sure what other math one would be doing

  For your answer though, I might rephrase it - there is an equal chance of directly linking and imitating for both graphs, given that
  <code>
   p=0.5
  </code>
