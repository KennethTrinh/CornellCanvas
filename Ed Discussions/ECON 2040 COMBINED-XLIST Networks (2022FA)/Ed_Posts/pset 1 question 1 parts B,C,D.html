  is it just me or am I repeating myself when answering this question for the HW: "if there is, name such a city and say why it has this property." like how should I respond to the part of the question because I find myself saying the same thing for parts B, C, and D? for instance, is there a concept of strong and weak ties that I should look to include in my explanation? I just want to make sure that I am not leaving anything out.

  The prompt for question 1 doesn't mention strong and weak ties, so I would say that you don't have to include them in your answer. It is okay to be saying similar things to answer the different parts. The questions themselves are quite similar, with only a few differences between them.
