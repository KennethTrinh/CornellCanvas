  In class we said that a node with no strong ties must satisfy the STC because it can not violate it. To clarify does this mean the nodes all connected in a triangle of weak ties would satisfy it, or does it only apply to stand alone nodes?

  The network you describe would satisfy the STC property for that reason. If you look at the wording in the book,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  "We say that a node A violates the Strong Triadic Closure Property if it has strong ties to two other nodes B and C, and there is no edge at all (either a strong or weak tie) between B and C. We say that a node A satisfies the Strong Triadic Closure Property if it does not violate it."

  Note that the first premise for being able to violate STC is to have strong ties to two other nodes. If a node doesn't have this (including nodes in larger networks), then it can't violate STC, and therefore satisfies it
