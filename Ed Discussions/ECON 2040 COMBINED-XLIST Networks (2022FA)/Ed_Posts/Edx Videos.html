  What videos on Edx cover this week's content/where can I find this information? Last week, it was posted on the slides to watch until "Network Balance implies Polarization" but I don't see anything similar for this week. A weekly reading/video schedule would be great!

  The videos covering game theory and finding Nash Equilibria are the first five videos under the "Games, Auctions, and Network Traffic" module on canvas.

  In regards to a weekly reading/video schedule, there's no official one yet but we can bring it up with the professors. The videos are generally organized in a way that follows the flow of the lectures, so you can find them under the respective canvas modules. There may also be instances where the lectures covers content that the EdX videos don't cover.
