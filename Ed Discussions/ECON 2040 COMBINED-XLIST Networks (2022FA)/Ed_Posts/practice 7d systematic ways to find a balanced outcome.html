 Hi, I've read previous posts regarding 7d in practice prelim but am still confused about how to find the balanced outcome in different networks. Could someone please explain how we could get a balanced outcome in a given network? Thank you!

  There is an example of how to find a balanced outcome in a particular graph in the lecture notes for Sept. 26th. However, it is more difficult to come up with a balanced outcome from scratch in larger/more complex graphs. One beneficial thing to do is to examine the relative power levels and come up a guess for what the splits might be and then check to see if they are a balanced outcome like what was done in 7c and 7b.

  For 7d in particular, I think that the question only asks about the relative power levels, so if you were to see that question on an exam or homework, you wouldn't need exact numbers for the balanced outcome.
