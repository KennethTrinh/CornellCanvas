 Am I overcomplicating things or is just using the equation enough for the explanation? For both a and b I assumed we just plug in the numbers to the equation and see if a c exists and if they're the same, but is there more to the question I'm not understanding? I'm wondering if this is the same for part c as well

  That approach sounds valid to me, as long as you show your work and show what your numbers imply (for example if a value for c doesn't exist, explain why in relation to the numbers posed by the question).
