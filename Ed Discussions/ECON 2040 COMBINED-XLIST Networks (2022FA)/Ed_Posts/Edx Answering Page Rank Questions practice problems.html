 On this example problem, the solution had 1/10 assigned to B, 3/20 assigned to C, and 1/4 assigned to E. How do we set up the problem in terms of x to get these solutions?

  You can use the same method from class; start by assigning some Page Rank value to A (called x), as directed. From there, using rules of page rank at equilibrium, you should be able to figure out how much page rank each other node gets in terms of x. Lastly, remember that by convention, the total page rank in the network should sum to 1, allowing you to solve for x
