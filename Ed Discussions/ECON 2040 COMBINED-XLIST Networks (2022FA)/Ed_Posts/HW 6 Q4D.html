  For 4D, can we assume that if person 10 chooses A, then person 11 can assume the signal of both person 9 and 10 (since they know that 10 knows 9's signal) or should we only assume that they can deduce 10's signal?

  If you can determine the signal of person 9 only from the information that 11 is given, then we can assume that 11 will also make that determination.
