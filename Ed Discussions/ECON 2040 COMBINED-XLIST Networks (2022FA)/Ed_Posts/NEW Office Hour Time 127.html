 Hey all, because my office hours currently conflict with the exam review session on Wednesday (12/7), I will be holding my office hours at

  <underline>
   11:00AM-1:00PM
  </underline>
 </b>
 on Wednesday 12/7 in Rhodes 514 as usual.
</p>

 I'll bring a couple practice problems we can do and you can ask any questions you might have.
