  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For question 6c on the practice final, can we please get a clarification on what the question is asking? Based on my work, I thought the number of pages strictly greater than Cs PageRank decreased, but the answer does not say that. Thanks!

  Not quite sure what you're asking - the question is asking whether the number of pages with more PageRank than C will change
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  (the answer being no change, as we can see that the same amount of PageRank will flow in and out of C and C' as before (you could view them as a black box, with the rest of the system remaining the same), so they will have the same amount in terms of
  <code>
   a
  </code>
  , with the only change in relative values being a slight scale down due to the addition of a new node)

  Im confused though why the answer would be no change. I understand that the relative value wouldn't change, as it would still be a/3. However, with the introduction of another a/3 term in part c), that dilutes the total value within each node. If we are talking about question b) there are 3 nodes that have more relative page rank than C. Those would be the nodes with value a, a/2 and 3a/4 as those are all more than a/3. However, when the page rank gets diluted, this new value for a makes it so that the a/2 in part c) is now less than the a/3 in part b). Would the answer not be that the amount of pages with page rank strictly greater than C's page rank not decrease as now a/2 (Node E) from part C) is now less than a/3 (Node C) from part b)?

  If the relative values don't change, then the number of nodes with PageRank greater or less than don't change, as those are relative comparisons?
 </paragraph>

  It sounds like you're trying to compare absolute values from part c and part b - those are completely separate. We are concerned only with how the values of other nodes in part c compare to Node C's value in part c. The question asks you to compare the
  <italic>
   number of nodes with greater value
  </italic>
  between parts, not the actual values between the two parts, so that an acceptable answer might be of the form "There are X nodes in Part B with value greater than C in part b, which is greater than the Y nodes that have value greater than C in part c". Values are not compared across the parts, only the number of nodes
