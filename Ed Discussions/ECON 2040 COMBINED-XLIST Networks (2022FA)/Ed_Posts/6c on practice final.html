 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 For question 6c on the practice final, can we please get a clarification on what the question is asking? Based on my work, I thought the number of pages strictly greater than Cs PageRank decreased, but the answer does not say that. Thanks!
</p>

  Not quite sure what you're asking - the question is asking whether the number of pages with more PageRank than C will change
 </p>
 <p>
  (the answer being no change, as we can see that the same amount of PageRank will flow in and out of C and C' as before (you could view them as a black box, with the rest of the system remaining the same), so they will have the same amount in terms of
  <code>
   a
  </code>
  , with the only change in relative values being a slight scale down due to the addition of a new node)

   Im confused though why the answer would be no change. I understand that the relative value wouldn't change, as it would still be a/3. However, with the introduction of another a/3 term in part c), that dilutes the total value within each node. If we are talking about question b) there are 3 nodes that have more relative page rank than C. Those would be the nodes with value a, a/2 and 3a/4 as those are all more than a/3. However, when the page rank gets diluted, this new value for a makes it so that the a/2 in part c) is now less than the a/3 in part b). Would the answer not be that the amount of pages with page rank strictly greater than C's page rank not decrease as now a/2 (Node E) from part C) is now less than a/3 (Node C) from part b)?

    If the relative values don't change, then the number of nodes with PageRank greater or less than don't change, as those are relative comparisons?

    It sounds like you're trying to compare absolute values from part c and part b - those are completely separate. We are concerned only with how the values of other nodes in part c compare to Node C's value in part c. The question asks you to compare the
    <i>
     number of nodes with greater value
    </i>
    between parts, not the actual values between the two parts, so that an acceptable answer might be of the form "There are X nodes in Part B with value greater than C in part b, which is greater than the Y nodes that have value greater than C in part c". Values are not compared across the parts, only the number of nodes
