  When advertisers are not bidding their true value, how is the payoff equation different than the case in which they are bidding truthfully. I understand the payoff to be calculated as clickthrough rate*(value-amount paid), but I am confused if the value is referring to the bid they stated (could be different than true value) or if it always their true value per click.

  This is a great point - it is always their true value. Payoff is an individual notion internal to a buyer (what they actually experience getting an item), and we calculate it to help determine what buyers will do (whether they will want to take an offer, switch to another, etc.) Therefore, payoff should be based on a true value (what the buyer actually cares about), rather than a different value used as their bid.

  In the case where advertisers aren't bidding their true value, we can't assume any connection between their bid and their internal value for an item, and therefore can't use their bid to calculate any form of payoff/personal incentive
