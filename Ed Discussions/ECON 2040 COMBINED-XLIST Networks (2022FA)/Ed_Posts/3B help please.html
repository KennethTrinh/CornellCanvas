  For 3B,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  do you need a system of three equations and 3 variables.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  one of the equations must be x +y+z = 100
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  and the other ones are the addition of nodes ACB, AEB, and ADB.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  just need some assistance on this problem
 </paragraph>

  The equation you have is correct. From the paths you've outlines, you should be able to compute some travel times. We know that at equilibrium, these travel times should be equal (as switching to another would increase the travel time and be worse), so you should be able to solve from there

  Ah, yup :) Naively taking the equations and plugging them in will result in this, which is obviously not realistic. One assumption that you may not be aware that you're making is the assumption that all the roads should be used...

  so if not all roads are used, would it be acceptable that either x,y, or z has a value of 0?

  If no one is using a road, then yes, the number of people driving on that road (x, y, or z, depending on the road) would be 0
