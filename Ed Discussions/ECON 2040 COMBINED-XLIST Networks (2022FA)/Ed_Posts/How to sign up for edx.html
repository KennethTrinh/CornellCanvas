  At the end of the first lecture on Monday, the slide at the end said that we should do module 1 through â€œnetwork balance implies polarization". I can't seem to find the link on canvas to sign up for edx. Should I go to edx.org and register?

  On the course website (
  <link href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs2850/2022fa/"/>
  https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs2850/2022fa/), there is a link to the edx course under Materials:
  <link href="https://www.edx.org/course/networks-crowds-and-markets"/>
  https://www.edx.org/course/networks-crowds-and-markets

  From there, you can register for edx and access the archived course.

  You can also find the relevant edx videos on Canvas in the Videos module. The edx site also allows you to do short multiple choice quizzes after most of the videos; so signing up for it is also useful.
