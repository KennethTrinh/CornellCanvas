  I haven't checked my answer yet, but my math gave me PR(A) = 1/13. However, as I continue, none of the following questions seem to make sense. For example, the next question asks PR(B); I got 1/26 for that but none of the answer choices for PR(B) have 26 in the denominator. This follows for the rest of the questions; did I do the math very wrong somewhere?
