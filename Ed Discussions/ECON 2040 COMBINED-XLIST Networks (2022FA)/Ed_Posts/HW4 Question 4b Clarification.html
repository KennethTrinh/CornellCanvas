  Q4b states that we should perform "the 2-step hub-authority computation on the resulting network (as in part (a))." As I understand it, one round of the hub-authority computation already has two steps (update authority scores, update hub scores), so is this asking us to do one round of this two-step update or two rounds?

  Thanks for your question. To answer the question, you should find and compare authority scores in the second round of the hub-authority computation.

  In other words, you should complete two rounds of the procedure, not just one. I hope this helps!
