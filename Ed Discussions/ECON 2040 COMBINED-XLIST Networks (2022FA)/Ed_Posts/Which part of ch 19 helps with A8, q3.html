  I don't believe non-diagonal matrices are covered explicitly in the textbook; however, you can extend the same ideas from 19.2 to use the payoffs in finding a threshold value for q (the slides from lecture on November 4th might also help, as they started to consider matrices like these with payoffs on the non-diagonal entries)
