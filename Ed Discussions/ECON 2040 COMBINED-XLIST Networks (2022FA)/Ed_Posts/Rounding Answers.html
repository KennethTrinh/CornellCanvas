  How many decimal places should our answers be rounded to? For question 1c, one of my average distances was calculated to be 2.5454. Depending on how I round this number, my answer to the question would be different.

  I agree with Joseph. Generally, I would suggest keeping at least three decimals places for numerical answers moving forward.
