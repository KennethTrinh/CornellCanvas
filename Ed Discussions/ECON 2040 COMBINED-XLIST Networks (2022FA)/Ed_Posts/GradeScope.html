 If I submitted the homework on time but then later realized that I had to reselect the pages correctly again, that wouldnâ€™t be considered as late submitting right ?

  Going back to marking the questions will not cause your problem set to be flagged as late. But if you re-upload a new pdf  after the due date I think that it will be marked as late.
