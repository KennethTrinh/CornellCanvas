  I noticed the "Guidelines for Blog Posts" mentioned that our online resource for the blog must be  something like "a recent news article, an academic paper, ... novel work in this area" and was wondering if a paper from 2012 (but with still-relevant ideas) would be acceptable. I came across the paper a few months ago but am now able to better understand it with the concepts learned through this course; I thought it would be interesting to return to and write about the paper but just wanted to check if that would be acceptable for this assignment.
