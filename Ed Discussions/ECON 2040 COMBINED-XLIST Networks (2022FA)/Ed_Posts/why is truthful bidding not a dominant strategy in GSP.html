 since bidder i is paying the (i+1)st highest price, why would they be inclined to not bid truthfully?

  Not quite - see the solutions to Homework 5, Question 4 for a concrete example. We never went beyond this in a formal proof in class, but the intuition is that because there are multiple items in play now, a bidder's bid now no longer affects whether they get the item or not, but what quality of item they get. Because of this, we can't use the same reasoning as before that their bid determines at what price they pay - it is more of a spectrum, and we can see that changing bids can possibly lead to an increase in payoffs.

  To directly answer your question; yes, they pay the (i+1)th highest price,

   but for what good?
  </i>
  Sometimes, it might be worth paying a higher price if you can get a large enough increase in quality of good (determined by your payoff for it). This effect didn't come into play with the single-item second-price auction (as there was only one item), allowing us to have truthful bidding as a dominant strategy. However, with multiple items, the logic we used before doesn't hold - it isn't a clean divide between buy or don't buy
