  im confused on how to use VCG procedure to charge buyers for their assigned items. in the example, X gets A, Y gets B, and W gets C (Z gets nothing). the correct answer is Pax = 11, Pby = 6, Pcw = 2. i appreciate any help. thanks!

  VCG prices are dependent on the harm that is done to the other buyers in the market by taking an item. Let's consider buyer x, who gets item A. y gets item B which they value at 10 and w gets item C which they value at 4. z gets nothing, which they value at 0. This matching is maximizes total valuation.

 <paragraph>
  If x takes item A, then the valuation of the rest of the buyers in the market is (10 + 4 + 0) = 14. To calculate harm, we consider their valuation when x is not in the market. If this were the case, then buyer y would take item A, which they value at 15. Buyer w would get item B, which they value at 8. Buyer z would get item C, which they value at 2. Thus, the total valuation in a market without buyer x is (15 + 8 + 2) = 25. The difference between these two valuations is the harm that x does by entering the market and taking item A. This gives us 25 - 14 = 11 as the harm done. Thus, our VCG price for buyer x getting item A is 11. The remaining prices can be determined in much the same way.
