 Practice Prelim 7d:
</p>
<p>
 How do we find the balanced outcome in the new scenario (which is, the balanced outcome has B getting 12, C and D getting 6 each and A,E and F each getting 0)?
</p>
<p>
 Thank you.

  We can see right off the bat that B has lots of power, so we can start there. Given that B has at least two nodes captive (they have no other option), we know B will get the full payoff of 12 (as each captive node will always undercut the other to strike a deal where B gets more than before, as the little amount they get is better in nothing. In a Nash Equilibrium, this trend continues all the way to B getting full, and A/E/F getting nothing)
 </p>
 <p>
  The only nodes left are C and D. These nodes don't want to do a deal with B (as that would mean they get 0) as they have a better option - each other. If they split the surplus according to Nash Bargaining (where the outside option is getting 0 in a deal with B), they each get 6
