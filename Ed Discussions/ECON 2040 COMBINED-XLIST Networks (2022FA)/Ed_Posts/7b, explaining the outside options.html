 Hi, I've seen a lot of questions about 7b but I haven't seen any explicitly answering why the inner nodes have an outside option of 3. How do we arrive at this? I'd figure that we'd have something more like a 2/3 situation like in our 4 node path example, where inner nodes would get a split of 8 and 4 with the outer nodes, making the outside option 4 at best. Thank you!
</p>

  I think I might understand why now. Basically if A gets $3 and B gets $9, and likewise for the other pairs, then B does have the option of giving 9 to C or D to get them to do a deal with them, in which case B would get $3. And it works out to $3 because any more and C or D would just do a deal with the outer nodes.
 </p>
 <p>
  And 7c is balanced because no outer node would accept any less than 4 to get half the surplus, and the inner nodes can't get more than that trading with each other, so there's no point in trying.
 </p>
 <p>
  Please feel free to check my logic here.

   1) Exactly - C and D are already getting 9, so in order to do a deal with them, B would have to offer at least 3, making 3 B's outside option
  </p>
  <p>
   2) Yes - once the surplus is found, it is balanced when it is split equally among the nodes on the edge for the given surplus
