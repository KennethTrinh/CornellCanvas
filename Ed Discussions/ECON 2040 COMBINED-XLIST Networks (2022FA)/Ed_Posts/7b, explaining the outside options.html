  Hi, I've seen a lot of questions about 7b but I haven't seen any explicitly answering why the inner nodes have an outside option of 3. How do we arrive at this? I'd figure that we'd have something more like a 2/3 situation like in our 4 node path example, where inner nodes would get a split of 8 and 4 with the outer nodes, making the outside option 4 at best. Thank you!

  I think I might understand why now. Basically if A gets $3 and B gets $9, and likewise for the other pairs, then B does have the option of giving 9 to C or D to get them to do a deal with them, in which case B would get $3. And it works out to $3 because any more and C or D would just do a deal with the outer nodes.
 </paragraph>

  And 7c is balanced because no outer node would accept any less than 4 to get half the surplus, and the inner nodes can't get more than that trading with each other, so there's no point in trying.

  Please feel free to check my logic here.

  1) Exactly - C and D are already getting 9, so in order to do a deal with them, B would have to offer at least 3, making 3 B's outside option

  2) Yes - once the surplus is found, it is balanced when it is split equally among the nodes on the edge for the given surplus
