  Could you explain the reasoning behind this? I still feel a bit unsure. Is it mostly because it is a single slot auction?

  Correct - we know that for single items (our "regular" second price auction from before), it is a dominant strategy to bid your value, as your bid doesn't determine how much you pay, but rather at what prices you would win.
