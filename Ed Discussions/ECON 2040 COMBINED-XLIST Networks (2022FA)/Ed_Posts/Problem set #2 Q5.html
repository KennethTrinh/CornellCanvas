 For question 5 on the problem set, I was wondering if we are supposed to assume that all enemies have a + edge between them.

  Don't assume nodes have a positive edge between them just because they share a common enemy. Each scenario in Q5 provides unique criteria that could result in a network where all enemies of a certain node have a + edge between them, but some may not.
