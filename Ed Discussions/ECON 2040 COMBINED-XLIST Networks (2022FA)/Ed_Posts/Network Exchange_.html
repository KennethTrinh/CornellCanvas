  From the practice midterm:
 </p>
 <p>
  "The best guide to the coverage of the midterm is the contents of the course lectures up through the end of the network exchange theory topic covered in class (Chapter 12) "
 </p>
 <p>
  Chapter 12 is all about network exchange. There was also a problem about it on the practice midterm, so that should hopefully be an indicator
