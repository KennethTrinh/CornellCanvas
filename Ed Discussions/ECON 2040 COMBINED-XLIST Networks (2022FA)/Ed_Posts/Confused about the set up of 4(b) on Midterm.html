  For 4(b), I noticed that the graph I drew out represents the Braess Paradox.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Since ACDB is a strictly dominant strategy in this paradox, I get why CB would be dominated by DB. How come this same logic do not apply to AD and AC? Shouldn’t the travel time on AC be less than the travel time on AD?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I saw in the answer key that CD does not have a travel time so that is why AC and AD should have the same travel time, but it doesn’t seem to make sense to me.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thank you for your help.

  Not quite - we have 140 travelers in total. If they all took AC, then the travel time would be 140/10=14, greater than the 4 for AD. Therefore, travelers will only continue to take AC until the travel time is equal to AD (at 4, at which point travelers would be better off taking AD than taking AC with an increasing travel time)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The only reason DB takes less time is because even when all travelers take it, it is still better (less time) than CB (if there were more travelers, they would continue to take CD over DB). The same is not true for AC and AD; travel time for all travelers on AC would be greater than AD, so it only acquires travelers until the point where they are equal.

  Thank you Aidan. What I was thinking was that x could be equal to 30, which would make AC travel time equal to 3 hours. AC’s 3 hours is less than 4 hours on AD, making AC more of a desirable path.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  This would mean that ACB has a travel time of 11 hours, ADB with 11 hours, and ACDB with 10 hours (30/10 + 0 + 140/20). This would make ACDB the dominant strategy but x is supposed to be 40. I am still confused why x is 40, not 30.

  You're correct that AC would be desirable, but that would just cause drivers on AD to instead choose AC.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If x were 30, some of the 110 people taking AD would go "Hey, we could take AC, get to the same place (as CD takes 0 time), but take less travel time". This would prompt them to switch from AD to AC, making that particular setup not an equilibria. You can see how this would continue until the travel time on AC was equal to that of AD, which occurs when both take 4 hours and x=40
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Additionally, just not sure where the number 30 comes from...

  Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. DB and CB is different from AC and AD. Everyone would want to take AC instead of AD if AC has a travel time of 3 hours. So overtime, AC would become congested and ACDB will no longer be an equilibrium. And this shouldn’t happen because ACDB is supposed to be the equilibrium in Braess.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For the x = 30, I was just trying to find an x value that would make AC to have less travel time than AD. But I completely understand that my reasoning was wrong.

  Thank you so much!!

  Of course! The last thing is that I think a lot of these labels (Braess' Paradox and whether AC "should" be quicker than AD) come up as a result of the situation/equilibria, but shouldn't motivate it. I'm not sure we should say "Ok, that looks like Braess' Paradox, so let's find values that make it so the middle path is shortest", but should instead just analyze the equilibria states for variables/travelers, and assign such labels at the end. Not all situations with a middle path such as CD will be a Braess' Paradox :)
