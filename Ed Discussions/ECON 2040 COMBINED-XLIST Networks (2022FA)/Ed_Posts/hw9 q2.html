 for 2bcd, do buyers know that there are only bad and medium cars sold, or is it that there are no good car sellers but buyers think they are still some sellers selling good cars so it doesn't affect their expected price in (a)

  First off, "only bad and medium cars" is only relevant to (b), I think
 </p>
 <p>
  Second, it will definitely affect the buyers' expected value (see slides from 11/14 for an example). The buyers know the breakdown of the cars (which they can use to factor into their probability of getting one). However, the point of a self-fulfilling expectations equilibria is that if someone expects something to happen, then it actually does.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this case, we want to see if, when buyers expect only bad and medium cars to be sold, then those are in fact the only cars sold. If buyers expected this and medium cars weren't sold, or if good cars were sold as well, then it wouldn't be a self-fulfilling expectations equilibria
 </p>
 <p>
  (The notion of "equilibria" comes in when we examine it over time. If a buyer expects something and it doesn't happen, then their expectation will gradually shift over time. However, if they expect something and it does in fact happen (
  <i>
   as a result of that expectation
  </i>
  ), then nothing will shift)

   ok so we have to recalculate the expected value, just to confirm?

    Yup - if buyers don't expect good cars to be sold, then their expected value will change to not incorporate the likelihood of getting a good car
