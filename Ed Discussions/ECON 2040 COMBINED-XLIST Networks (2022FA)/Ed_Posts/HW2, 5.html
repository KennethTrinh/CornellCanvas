 I was wondering if we were supposed to draw more edges to connect certain cities in order to show the enemy or ally relationship between them or if we are only supposed to illustrate these relationships based on the edges that are drawn on the Figure?

  You can draw more edges - the edges in the Figure are simply showing you roads, but the enemy/ally relationship edges are another whole graph. Since +/- relationships can exist between "geographically far" nodes on the original Figure, make sure you consider all triangles, including those that aren't next to each other.
