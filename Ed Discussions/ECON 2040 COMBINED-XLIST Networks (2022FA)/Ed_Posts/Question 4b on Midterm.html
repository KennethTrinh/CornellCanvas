 I was confused about 4b on the midterm as the answer says equilibrium time shifts from 10 to 11. If that is the case, wouldn't the distribution of travelers be the same as in 4a as the equilibrium time is shorter?

  Nope - this is Braess' Paradox! (Where adding a route can increase equilibrium time when everyone acts rationally - for another example, see lecture notes from 9/7)
