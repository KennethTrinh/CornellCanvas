  Does it matter that the first student drew a red marble if p is in the range which causes the first student to guess MB?

  "Does it matter" is most of the question, so hard to answer - what may be helpful is reflecting that the second student only knows about the first student's
  <bold>
   guess
  </bold>
  , not their
  <bold>
   draw
  </bold>
  . Along with the fact that "p is in the range which causes the first student to guess MB regardless of the color of marble they draw", this should hopefully help answer the question

  So would we have to think of 2 cases when the second student draws R or B based on the fact that the first student guessed MB? and use Bayes?

  I don't think you even need to use Bayes here - what I recommend is seeing what information the first student's guess adds for the second student to work off of. Based on this, how would the second student behave differently than the first?
