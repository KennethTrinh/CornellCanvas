  We don't have a list of problem set due dates. However, most of them will be due weekly on Thursday at 3:30pm. After this pset, there will be 6 remaining, so there will definitely be weeks where psets aren't due. If you want to plan, my advice would be to assume that psets will be handed out weekly. If a pset isn't due in a week then consider it extra free time.
