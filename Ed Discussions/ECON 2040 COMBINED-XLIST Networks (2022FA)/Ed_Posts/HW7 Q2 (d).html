 I don't remember if we discussed this in class, what will happen over time to the fraction using the product if the initial guess z is exactly the tipping point?

  A key idea is that at the tipping point, the fraction of people using the product needs to be exactly that. Since itâ€™s unrealistic for a fraction to remain at the exact same number, over time the product use will either move above or below, causing the fraction of people to move to a stable equilibrium.
