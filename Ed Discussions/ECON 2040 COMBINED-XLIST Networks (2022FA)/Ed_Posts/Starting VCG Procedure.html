 Generally, do we start the VCG procedure from the market clearing perfect match?
</p>
<p>
 For example, in HW5 Q2, we found the market clearing prices and the perfect matching but when we're asked to run the VCG procedure, is it enough to say that we started from the market clearing perfect match? Basically, how do we ensure that our VCG is "optimal" if we're just confirming our answer from part (a) and running the VCG from the pairing of the perfect match?

  VCG starts off with a perfect matching, so if you already have one, it is still valid. The main intuition/"optimization" VCG brings is the calculation of prices such that it is a dominant strategy to bid/report your value, which the question asks you to do

   Just to clarify, the matching with the VCG procedure is the same as the second-price auction matching; however, the prices are different (it is a calculation of harm for VCG). Is that right?
