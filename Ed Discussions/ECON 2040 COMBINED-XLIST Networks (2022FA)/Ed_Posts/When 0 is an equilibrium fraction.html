 Hi, I was looking through hw 7. Here, we're calculating equilibrium fractions where the price is 0.75. I'm a little confused as to how 0 is one of these equilibrium fractions:

 I can understand it in that when z = 0, it meets the self fulfilling expectation of the population, but it wouldn't give 0.75 in this equation. Thank you!

  Correct - we say that z=0 is always an equilibrium. This is because the actual result of (4z)(1-z)=0 is less than the price, meaning that the number of users would decrease, but we can't decrease past zero. Another way to look at it is that f(0)=0, so for any reservation price, the number of users would trend "down" towards 0, making it an equilibria. For more in-depth, see #512
