  Quote from Practice Mid-term:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  "The best guide to the coverage of the midterm is the contents of the course lectures up through the end of the network exchange theory topic covered in class (Chapter 12). (The material in the chapters and sections that we skipped, such as Chapters 4 and 7, will not be on the midterm. And the trading networks topic from Chapter 11 that we will cover next week will not be on the midterm.) "
