  I'm confused generally on how the first influences the second student's guess. I understand from lecture that logically the second person hears the first's guess and that influences their decision from what they get, but for the question how would we calculate this influence of the guess? Or do we do our calculations and then after say how the influence comes in?

  You definitely need to include the influence in your calculations - not sure how you would do it otherwise and get a concrete answer. In calculating conditional probability, you always want to know the probability of some event given some other event occurred. Here, you can imagine that the second student might have a different "occurred event" (representing their knowledge) than the first - the trick is how to factor this in
