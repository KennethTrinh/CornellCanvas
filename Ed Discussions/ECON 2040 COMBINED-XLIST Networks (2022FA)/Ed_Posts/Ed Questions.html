 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 In the EdX course, I saw the following question:
</p>

<p>
 Why would the lowest market clearing price be 5 and not 6?
</p>

  Note that since we have 3 buyers having the same value for two items, the problem is not overlapping favorites (each buyer has both items as their favorite), but rather that 3 buyers all want two goods. If we set the price at 5, for both items, then we get X's payoff of 7, Y's payoff of 0, and Z's payoff of 4. In this way, X and Z can each get one of their favorite items (either A or B), and Y will end up with no item,
  <b>
   <i>
    which is one of Y's preferred outcomes
   </i>
  </b>
  . Since Y has a payoff of 0 for all items,
  <underline>
   getting an item is the same as not getting it
  </underline>
  , and so a price of 5 allows Y to still get one of their preferred outcomes, even without getting an item.
 </p>
 <p>
  Note that if the price had been any lower, Y would have a non-zero payoff for getting an item, and would still have edges in the preferred seller network, making a perfect matching impossible
