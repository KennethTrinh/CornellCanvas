  Nope, but only by convention (and by realism). Remember that the quality of being market-clearing doesn't change if we shift all prices by the same amount. Therefore, any set of prices containing negative prices can be expressed as positive ones by adding some value to all of the prices, and they will still have the same quality (either market-clearing or not). We choose not to use negative prices because it's not too realistic (although I could imagine it if you're paying someone to take an item, such as with garbage collection)
