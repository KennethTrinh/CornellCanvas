  "So, for each option, show the normalized authority values that each of A, B, and X get when
  <break>
  </break>
  you run the 2-step hub-authority computation on the resulting network (as in part (a))"
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  Would this suggest that for our answer to 4b, we should repeat the "after normalization"  step values that we wrote in 4a or do we just answer which option would result in a higher score? Thanks!

  I'm not sure what you mean by "repeat the 'after normalization' step values that we wrote in 4a", but I can still try to make this clearer for 4b:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The question is asking you to
  <bold>
   show the normalized authority values that each of A, B, and X
  </bold>
  and to
  <bold>
   explain in which option X gets a higher authority score
  </bold>
  . What you may want to do is to
  <bold>
   construct the new networks in option 1 and option 2
  </bold>
  , do
  <bold>
   two rounds of hub-authority computation,
  </bold>
  and
  <bold>
   normalize your answer
  </bold>
  . After this process, you can easily show what authority values A, B, and X have and compare in which option X has a higher authority score.

  Let me know if you still have any confusion!
