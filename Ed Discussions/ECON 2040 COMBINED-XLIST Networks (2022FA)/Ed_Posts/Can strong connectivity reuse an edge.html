<p>
 can an edge be traversed twice to return to the starting edge?

  Yes, although it might be more accurately characterized as two paths rather than one?

   so though a cycle cannot reuse an edge, SCC can?

    Not quite sure what you mean by a "cycle" and SCC "using" an edge.
   </p>
   <p>
    The definition of SCC is that there is a path between every set of nodes in the set (as well as being maximal). If you use an edge twice in a path, then there was a cycle in the path, and you could just use the path without that cycle

     take figure 1 in the hw. you can go from 5 to 7 to 8 to 10 to 9 back to 7, but if you go back to 8 again, then you can return to 5 via 6. that is not a valid path, but is it a valid SCC? I think not.

      A path is still valid, even if it re-uses an edge. What I was saying is that if you re-use an edge, there's going to be a shorter, simpler path available (in the example you gave above, you can just go 5 -&gt; 7 -&gt; 8 -&gt; 6) Does this help? I don't think this would make it not an SCC...

       5-7-8-6 is a smaller component than 5-7-8-10-9-7-8-6-5

        Ok - I think I was misunderstanding what you were asking. Bottom line is - you can re-use edges in paths. (Note that 5-7-8-6 isn't an SCC, but the other one you specified is)
       </p>

         5-7-8-6-5 is a SCC if my understanding is correct
        </p>

          To clarify:
         </p>
         <list style="bullet">
          <li>
           <p>
            The path 5-7-8-6 alone doesn't constitute a path that defines an SCC, but the path 5-7-8-6-5 does, as all nodes have a path to all other nodes (as does the other circular path you mentioned)
           </p>
          </li>
          <li>
           <p>
            The
            <i>
             set
            </i>
            {5,7,8,6} is therefore an SCC because of the circular path above. SCC's are sets of nodes, not paths
           </p>
          </li>
         </list>
