  When is truthful bidding a dominant strategy in VCG ? Do we need to calculate every time to determine this.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  And for this problem. It is a second price auction. When is truthful bidding not a dominant strategy?

  Truthful bidding is always a dominant strategy in VCG. It was proven in class and in the textbook (

  https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/networks-book/networks-book-ch15.pdf, section 15.4). You do not need to prove this again.

  Specifically in generalized second price auctions, truthful bidding is not a dominant strategy. Depending on the auction, it is possible for buyer to bid differently than their true value and gain more value from the auction. Section 15.5 details this (

  I believe what they mean is that the prices that the advertisers will end up paying for their slot are market-clearing prices.
