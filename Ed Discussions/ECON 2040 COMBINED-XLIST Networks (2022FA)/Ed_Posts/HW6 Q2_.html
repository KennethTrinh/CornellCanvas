  Im stuck on question 2 in homework 6. I cant recall anything from lecture or the textbook where we learned how to calculate the range of a value that would help determine the probability of something occurring. Is there something I am missing?

  It is just an application of what we have already learned. First consider the student's guess with no marble draw - what range of p would cause them to guess MB? There should be some cutoff value of p where what they should guess switches. You can consider this as that the probability of the urn being MB is a function of p (albeit a very simple one), and you have some range of probability that the urn is MB for which the student should guess MB (corresponding to a range of p)

  From here, we can approach the problem with them drawing a marble. From this, one can calculate the probability that the urn is MB. The student will logically guess MB for a range of these probabilities (the same as above), which corresponds to a range of p (as the probability that the urn is MB depends on p). Hope this helps!

  Does this range have to be inclusive? Ex: p
  <bold>
   âˆˆ
  </bold>
  (0.4, 1]. If we say that the cutoff value is p = 0.4, wouldn't all the values higher than 0.4 (like 0.40000001) will make the student guess MB.

  Personally, I didn't include this cutoff, just because at that point, the student could logically choose either, but I think as long as you explain it, it's ok
