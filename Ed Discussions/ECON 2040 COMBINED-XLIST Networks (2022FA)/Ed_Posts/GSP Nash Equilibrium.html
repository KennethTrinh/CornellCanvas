 I was looking through the textbook to get some clarity on how to approach Q4b and Q4c in pset5 and was confused about two things:
</p>
<p>
 1) how can we check the equilibrium condition for z in this example? Is it simply the fact that z's payoff will reduce if z increases or decreases their bid?
</p>
<p>
 2) Why do we not confirm if y's payoff will increase if y bids below z's current bid?
</p>
<p>
 For reference this example is on pg 454 of the pdf and references Fig 15.6.

  1) Z's payoff only changes when Z increases or decreases their bid
  <b>
   such that they get a different item
  </b>
  (as for a given item, the price isn't dependent on one's bid). Here, it's only relevant that Z could increase their bid. However, we would see that they would have to bid above 4 to get an item that would only give them a revenue of (4*1)=4, meaning that their payoff of 0 would remain the same and they have no incentive to change. To check that a given buyer is in equilibrium, we would verify that they have no incentive (cannot increase their payoff) from changing their bid
 </p>
 <p>
  2) We should check it, but it's fairly trivial, which is why I think the book skipped it. If y bids below z's bid, then they get an item (Item C) that they have 0 value for. This means that their payoff (value-price) cannot be above 0, and since they have a positive payoff where they are, they would have no incentive to change to get this item
