  When grading, we put some common mistakes to the rubric so that the TAs can directly choose which mistake this student's answer has in order to grade more efficiently. Point adjustment happens when the student's answer doesn't belong to any specified mistakes in the rubric, but the points for the question still need to be changed. Hence, you may see there is point adjustment with some explanation of why this adjustment has been made. Hope this makes sense to you!
