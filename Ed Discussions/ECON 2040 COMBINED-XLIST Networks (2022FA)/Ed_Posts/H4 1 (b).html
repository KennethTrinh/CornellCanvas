 What are we expected to explain besides which link we are going to add and which nodes are added to the strongly connect graph.
</p>
<p>
 Should we explain why is this link making the strongly connected component largest? And how could we explain that?
</p>
<p>
 Thank you
</p>

  You may write down the link you would like to create, and what components there are in the new largest SCC. You may explain this by saying how you cannot do any better with other choices of links.
