 How do we check for the case where there is an equilibrium and only one player randomizes? And when should we check for this case?

 I assume this will make itself shown when either p or q turn out to be pure (0 or1), leaving the other random? Is this true?

  It's almost never the case that there exists an equilibrium where only one player randomizes. Even if that one person randomizes, it will be because the payoffs are equal for both strategy, thus resulting in a 50/50 chance.

  It's possible to construct payoff matrices where one player randomizes and the other does not, but the situations are so rare that I doubt we will ask you that type of question.
