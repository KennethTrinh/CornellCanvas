  Just to clarify, we've defined strictly dominant as all the payoffs being strictly greater than payoffs from any other strategy (i.e. only &gt;). In this case, dominant strategies can be defined by payoffs "greater than or equal to" payoffs from any other strategy.

   I believe they are the same, just depends which source you look at - could be wrong though
