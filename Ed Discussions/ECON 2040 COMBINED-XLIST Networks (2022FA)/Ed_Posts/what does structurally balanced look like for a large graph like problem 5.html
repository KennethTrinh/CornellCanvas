<p>
 or do we have to decompose the graph into tri-graphs? if the majority of the trigraphs are balanced, does that mean the whole graph is?

  When you check if a network is balanced, you check every "triangle" in the graph. As long As one of the many triangles in the network is not balanced, this network is not structurally balanced.
