  Hi all, just wanted to make a quick correction from my office hours just now about Q1. We spoke a bit about the intuition and terminology behind cluster density for question 1 and I realized that I got a couple things wrong.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  More specifically, this is the actual definition from the book:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  "We say that a cluster of density p is a set of nodes such that each node in the set has at least a p fraction of its network neighbors in the set."
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  So the definition uses the fraction of network neighbors
  <italic>
   in the set
  </italic>
  (rather than my explanation using adoption/behaviors). The main idea behind the questions is still similar, but be sure to use this definition.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Check out #539 for a great explanation from Aidan as well as section 19.3 in the textbook for more information.
