 During the past two lectures my mobile iclicker hasnâ€™t been able to load. Does anyone have any suggestions for what I should do?

  There always seems to be a Wifi problem in Statler auditorium - we also don't know how to solve that. Maybe you could change your seat next time to see if Wifi works somewhere else.

  But the safest choice is just to get an iClicker remote and register your device with the course.
