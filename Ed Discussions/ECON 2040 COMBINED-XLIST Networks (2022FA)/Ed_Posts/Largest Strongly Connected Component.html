  Is it possible for the largest strongly connected component of a graph to consist simply of one node? Would it be reasonable to argue that one node can satisfy the first property, since a node has a path to itself? Or would this be incorrect since a node's path to itself without traveling through other edges is not considered a path?

  In terms of 1) c. though, is this what they are looking for? Should we answer that we would delete one of the links to make a node isolated by itself to make the smallest SSC group?

  It may or may not be the case that deleting a link decreases the largest SCC size to 1, but that could be possible and you would have to explain why in that case.
