  The baseline is the smallest value (who got the least value at the end) in your matching. For example, if your final matching has buyers a,b,c getting their items for {4,1,6} valuation, the baseline would be 1 (with a social welfare total of 11), because the smallest valuation you gave someone is 1. Perhaps there is another matching that results in {3,3,2} - this would have a baseline of 2.

   From homework: "letâ€™s define the baseline of a perfect matching M to be the minimum valuation that any buyer has for the item they get in M" Any specific confusion?
