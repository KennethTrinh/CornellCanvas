  From homework: "letâ€™s define the baseline of a perfect matching M to be the minimum valuation that any buyer has for the item they get in M" Any specific confusion?

  The baseline is the smallest value (who got the least value at the end) in your matching. For example, if your final matching has buyers a,b,c getting their items for {4,1,6} valuation, the baseline would be 1 (with a social welfare total of 11), because the smallest valuation you gave someone is 1. Perhaps there is another matching that results in {3,3,2} - this would have a baseline of 2.
