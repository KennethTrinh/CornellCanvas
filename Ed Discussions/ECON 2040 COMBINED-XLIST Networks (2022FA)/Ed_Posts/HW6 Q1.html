 How are we expected to explain Q1(a). I think it is just understanding the question we could get the answer.

  I think you are expected to define what A and B are, and say why that helps solve the problem presented. You are correct in that it could be viewed as "understanding the question", but a large issue can often be making sure you are solving the right issue.

  For instance, when we were working on matchings and payoffs, there were a lot of questions "What if the buyers did &lt;this&gt;". The common answer was that "That would change our payoffs", making the problem we were attempting to solve not representative of the overall situation. The same principle applies here - making sure you can accurately express the

   entire
  </b>
  problem in what you are finding is sometimes half the battle
