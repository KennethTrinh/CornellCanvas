  Is there any hint for question 4(b) or would you mind walking me through the logic of this question and the concept or Chapter it refers to I am really confused by this question?

  As a follow up question- I think I understand the premise but I'm not sure where X and Y go in figure 4. Is X an authority and Y a hub?

  I'm not sure I understand you question or not, since X and Y are both nodes. Authority score and hub score are attributes of these nodes which require your calculation after constructing the networks. You may refer to the description of two options to construct the networks, as it specifies pretty clearly about which new node links to which other existing nodes in Figure 4.

  4b asks you to compare two options. The two options described in question provide you with steps about how new nodes are linked to existing nodes in Figure 4. You may construct the networks under different options and use the same method that you used for 4a to calculate the authority scores for each node. And ultimately after calculating the authority scores, you may compare the authority score of page X.
