  What is the difference between a balanced and stable outcome. A stable outcome is if the edge is more than the total of outside options, but what about a balanced outcome and how do both of these relate to the bash bargaining outcome?

  A slight correction to stable: it doesn't have to be greater than the sum of outside options. Stability occurs when all nodes have lesser outside options than the deal they're currently in (so we don't really consider edges here, more individual nodes and whether they'd choose to switch)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Not quite sure what you mean by "balanced" here - the notion of a balanced network comes about with positive/negative edges.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Balanced doesn't relate to the Nash Bargaining Outcome, but every Nash Bargaining outcome is stable (although not vice versa). A Nash Bargaining Outcome occurs when the surplus (value of the edge - the sum of outside options) is split evenly between the nodes. If the surplus is negative, then the nodes would be better off doing deals with other nodes (meaning that the network isn't stable). All Nash Bargaining Outcomes are stable (as a non-negative surplus indicates stability), but not the other way around. An example of stability (but not Nash Bargaining) would be if a surplus existed, but wasn't split evenly.

  Just a slight correction to Aidan's answer: there are balanced outcomes in our analysis of network exchanges. This is the definition we are given:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Balanced Outcome: An outcome (consisting of a matching and node values) is balanced if, for each edge in the matching, the split of the money represents the Nash bargaining outcome for the two nodes involved, given the best outside options for each node provided by the values in the rest of the network.

  (See textbook section 12.8:

 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  As you can see, balanced outcomes are intrinsically linked to Nash Bargaining Outcomes, in that each edge of the matching must be a Nash bargaining outcome. It must also be true that a balanced outcome is stable, but it is not always true in reverse.
