  I understand how to set up this probability but I am having some trouble in finding key components of implementing Bayes Rule. Specifically, how can we go about figuring out the probability of an R-Cascade given that we are in a Good State (P[R|G]).

  I recommend not considering the probability of the entire R-Cascade occurring, but instead considering the probability of the elements that cause the R-Cascade to happen. In essence, you should be able to find the event B (which is hinted at by part a) such that because B occurred, we ended up in an R-Cascade (what event happened that caused us to be in this incorrect cascade?). You can then find Pr[B|G], which should hopefully be easier - hope this helps!
