 In the homework, is it okay to state a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium by only stating the values for p and q (having already defined what they represent and having written out equations) or do I have to write the mixed Nash equilibrium in words?
</p>
<p>
 An example of how I might state a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium by only stating the values for p and q would be: "The mixed Nash equilibrium is p=1/4, q=1/3."

  Sometimes different people might assign p and q to different options, which makes it confusing to read or grade.

  A way to write the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium would be to assign each option to a probability. For example, in a game where player A has choices U and D and player B has choices L and R, a way to write out the final mixed strategy Nash equilibrium would be Pr(U) = &lt;insert probability&gt;, Pr(D) =... etc. for all choices.
