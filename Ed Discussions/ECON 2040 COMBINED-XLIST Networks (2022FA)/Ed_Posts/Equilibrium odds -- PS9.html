  What is the difference of equilibrium inverse odds before vs. after horse A wins? I was under the impression that there was only one way to calculate the equilibrium inverse odds (with the equation a1*w1/w + a2*w2/w).

  The nuance here is about the weighted average of beliefs, which is a1 and a2 in your equation.

  You can try to think of this scenario: What would happen to the weighted average of beliefs if the bettor does not know which horse wins? And how would the weighted average of beliefs change after the bettors know the result of the first race?

  how do we know beliefs will change at all? past performance doesn't predict future performance? what presumptions about human inference making are we making?

  I think a better way to look at it might be; your belief in the first round will affect your amount of money in the second round. Therefore, if you have a relatively higher belief in horse A, after round 1, you will have more money to bet with that belief than the less confident one, almost subtely giving the stronger belief in horse A more preference in the market by giving it more money to bet with in round 2
