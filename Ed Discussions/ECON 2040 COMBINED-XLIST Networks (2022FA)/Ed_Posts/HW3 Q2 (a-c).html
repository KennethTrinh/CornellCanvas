  What happens in the case that both bidders bid the same amount? I'm not sure how to approach b) and c) if we don't know what happens when there are equal bids. Is a winner chosen at random? This is not addressed within the question.

  If both of the bidders bid the same amount, a winner is chosen at random and the price paid will be maximum of the reserve price and the second highest bid (joint first in a tie). In other words, if at least one of the buyers  values are at or above the reserve price, the item will be sold.
