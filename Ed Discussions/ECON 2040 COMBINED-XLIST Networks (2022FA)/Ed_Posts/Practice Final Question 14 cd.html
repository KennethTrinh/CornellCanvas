 Good afternoon!
</p>
<p>
 I understand how to approach question 14 for parts a and b, however, for parts c and d I am a bit confused in regards to how to set up the equations and especially the intuition behind it.
</p>
<p>
 I would appreciate an in depth explanation of this question,
</p>
<p>
 thanks
</p>

  Part c) comes from our definition of what is paid out to bettors after a horse wins a race (or more generally something happens in the market).

 <p>
  In this case, a
  <sub>
   n
  </sub>
  stands for bettor n's belief that horse A will win. w
  <sub>
   n
  </sub>
  is the wealth that they had originally (before their bet and their subsequent payout) and O
  <sub>
   A
  </sub>
  , which is just the market odds we found in part b). We can plug in the values that are given to us in the problem to solve the rest of the problem. For example, bettor 1 would get a payoff of (1/4 (belief) * w (wealth) * 2 (equilibrium odds)). Intuitively, we are just figuring out how much money each bettor gets after they bet on the race. Since they bet all their money, this new calculation represents the new amount of money that each bettor ends up with.
 </p>
 <p>
  Part d) uses these new updated wealth values to calculate the new inverse equilibrium odds. We are given an equation for this:

  Note that a
  <sub>
   1
  </sub>
  ...a
  <sub>
   n
  </sub>
  are just the beliefs of the bettors, which we are told are unchanged. w
  <sub>
   1
  </sub>
  ...w
  <sub>
   n
  </sub>
  is the current wealth of each bidder, which we calculated in part c. In the denominator, we have w, which is the total wealth. Note that this is just the sum of w
  <sub>
   1
  </sub>
  ...w
  <sub>
   n
  </sub>
  . Using this information, we can plug in an solve for the inverse equilibrium odds. Intuitively, we can think of these inverse equilibrium odds as a kind of weighted estimate of the beliefs of the bidders. We can see that the belief of those who have a higher wealth share (w
  <sub>
   n
  </sub>
  /w) are better "represented" in the final odds. Thus, every time wealth is redistributed (after a race for example), we must recalculate these wealth shares to find this weighted estimate once again.
