 hi, i don't have any sds accommodations but is it possible to ask for more time for the next test, the final? i honestly thought the content wasn't bad on the midterm but i just needed more time to process everything because i felt rushed at the end... i'm upset that the reason i'm going to lose points is not because i didn't know the content., but because i didn't have enough time to think things through.

  The next test will be the final and you will have much more time during the final.
