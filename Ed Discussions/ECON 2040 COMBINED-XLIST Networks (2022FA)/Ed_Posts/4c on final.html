  Could someone explain how to get the solution for this question? I'm a bit confused about how to get the bid values.

  In the GSP, if an advertiser bids the ith highest bid, he will get the ith best slot and will have to pay the (i+1)th highest bid. So if advertiser a bids 5 (his true value), then he gets slot a and has to pay 3. So his net value is 6*(5-3) = 12, because he values clicks at 5-3 and the clickthrough rate for slot a is 6.

  It turns out there's a better alternative for a that isn't bidding their true value. What would happen if a bids 2?
