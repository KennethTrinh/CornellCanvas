  Do the polygons in a visibility graph all need to be the same shape/size (within a single graph) or can they be different sizes/shapes/angles?
 </paragraph>

  I find that any scene is possible to draw as a visibility graph if I position and shape (and size) the polygons all differently and at just the right angles to each other.
