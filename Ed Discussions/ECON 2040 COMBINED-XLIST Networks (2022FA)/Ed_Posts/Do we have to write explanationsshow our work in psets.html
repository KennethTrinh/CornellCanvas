  Title! I'm specifically referring to questions that don't explicitly say "write a short explanation" or anything along those lines.

  I think that it depends on the format of the question. For example, if you are asked to provide a drawing (as in HW1), the drawing and labels should be sufficient if you are not asked to write an explanation. However, in the future, you might run into problems that ask for numerical calculations without explicitly asking for an explanation. In this case, I would personally provide a brief explanation just so that you can potentially get partial credit if you get the calculations wrong.

  If you are ever unsure of whether you should provide an explanation for a specific question in a pset, feel free to post here and we can hopefully clarify.

  Makes sense! I was wondering for questions like in PS1 1.a), can I just write the number for each without writing an explanation?

  Yes, that should be okay. If you wanted to be extra thorough, you could list what is in each component for each removal, but I think that this question is just looking for the numbers.
