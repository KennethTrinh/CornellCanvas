  in part (a) i got that there are no NE (and therefore no ESS since all ESS are NE).

 <paragraph>
  In part (b) (Y,Y) is an NE but it isn't an ESS.

  I would look at your answer for part (a) again and try to find a NE. This will be helpful for answering part (c). Here is a hint to start off: what is player B's best response to Player A playing strategy X?
