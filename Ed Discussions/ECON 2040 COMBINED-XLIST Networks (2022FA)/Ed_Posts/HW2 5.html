 When doing structural balance theorem and breaking the larger graph into triangles, do we only look at the nodes that are next to each other on the graph (i.e. F, G, H) or is it any combination of the nodes (i.e. A, G, J) to form a triangle?

  When you're checking for the structural balance theorem, focus on the new positive/negative ties, not the original edges/"roads". The positive and negative ties can occur between nodes that are "physically" far away on the larger graph, so there likely are triangles you need to consider all over the map between nodes that aren't next to each other on the original graph.
