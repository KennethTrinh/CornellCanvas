  Page 400 of the book deals with PageRank. Page 400 of the PDF deals with Strongly Connected Components (at least for my copy) - would you mind being a bit more specific, as I don't think these were the pages you intended?

   A useful section in the book might be in Section 15.6, specifically analyzing whether Figure 15.6 is in a Nash Equilibrium (the reasoning should be the same)

     Yes, I believe this would be sufficient work to show that a given setup isn't a Nash Equilibria. You may have to show more work (doing this type of analysis for all buyers) to show it
