 For a strategy to be strictly dominated, does it have to be beat by the SAME strategy in every case. Or, can it be beat by alternative strategy 1 in some cases and alternative strategy 2 in all other cases?

    A strategy does not have to be beat by the same strategy in every case to be strictly dominated. Like you said, as long as every payoff for this strategy is dominated by some other payoff for another strategy, it is strictly dominated (given that the other payoffs are strictly greater and not equal).

   EDIT: the answer above is incorrect. If a strategy is strictly dominated by another strategy, then it is the case that it has to be beaten by the same strategy in every case. For more clarification, see Jason's comment below or section 6.10 part B in the textbook.

   When I asked professor Easley about this after class about a week ago, he said that a strategy B is strictly dominated by C if taking C always yields higher payoff than taking B regardless of what the other player does (this also happens to be the Wikipedia definition). This is different from the definition you give, and would probably change my answers to some of the homework problems. Should I switch to use the definition mentioned above?

    Oops, looks like I made a mistake in my answer. The textbook confirms the single strategy dominance idea like you mentioned. Stick with what Professor Easley mentioned. I will edit my answer and send out a notice. Thanks!
