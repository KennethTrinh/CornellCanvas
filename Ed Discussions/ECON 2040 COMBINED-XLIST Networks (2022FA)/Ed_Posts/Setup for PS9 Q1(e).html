  I am a little confused about how to set up the probability equations for 1e. Currently, I am thinking that it should be the probability of horse A winning in a world with p probability, added to the probability of A winning in a world with q probability. The probability of it being a world with p probability was calculated in part (d), so I used that answer to help with (e). However, this gets me the same answer in part (e) as I got for part (b), instead of my "combined answers to parts (d) and (e)" as the hint suggests. Is this logic on the right track?

  I think you're headed in right direction! Note that part (b) consists of two parts (wealth shares and then equilibrium inverse odds), so the hint might be suggesting that your two answers for d and e match up with the two parts of b.
