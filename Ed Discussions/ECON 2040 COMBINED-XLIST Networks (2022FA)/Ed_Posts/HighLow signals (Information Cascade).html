 Hi, I was reviewing for the final and had 2 questions in regards to information cascades:
</p>
<p>
 1. When deciding whether to accept or reject, do you include your own signal in consideration? (especially if it's a tie-breaking situation)
</p>
<p>
 2. Are the only people important in the consideration the very first 2 people and the last person before you? What if the last person also knows the second last person's decision?
</p>
<p>
 This is in relation to HW pset 6 Question 4c and d. Thanks!
</p>

  1. If the person is indifferent between A and R (they both have probability 1/2) then they will follow their own signal. And this also applies to tie-breaking situations, which may detach from the cascade that has happened. Essentially you can think of this question as a way that people calculate the probability of good or bad state based on what they observed, and then choose between accept or reject.
 </p>
 <p>
  2. I'll address the second question here first. I think you're referring to "last person's signal" instead of decision, because the decision/choice is shown to everyone. Imagine that you are the person who's making a choice now. If the last person before you knows the second last person's signal, then the last person's decision is based the first 2 people and the second last person. If you know "the last person knows the second last person's signal", then you can infer what's the composition of these four people' signals (first 2 people, last person, and second last person)
 </p>
 <p>
  For this type of questions, what you want to do is to use the observed signals to calculate the probability of good or bad state, and hence make decision to accept or reject.

   Thank you for the response! Just to double check, when calculating the probability of good or bad state, do you include your own observation (high or low signal) as well? Or is it just based on other people's signals before you?

    They do include their own observation.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the case of 4c: Person 10 knows that the first two people receive low and person 9 receives high. If person 10 draws high, then there will be 2 lows and 2 highs, and person 10 will follow their own sign, which is to accept. If person 10 draws low, then there will be 3 lows and 1 highs, so person 10 will choose to reject.
