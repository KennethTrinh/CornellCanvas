 For 4C, do we need to use Bayes rule to calculate probabilities, or is it sufficient to explain using logic/concepts?

  I think this question has been asked a lot for other parts (#467, #469, #472) - the general consensus seems to be that if you don't think you need to, you don't have to, but it's always helpful as a backup
