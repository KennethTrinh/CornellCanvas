 Confused as to why the answer for 3c can't just be z = 400, x = 0, y = 0. This equilibrium still means average the total travel time is 3 hours?

  bc ppl will always take the fastest route until it becomes slower than the next fastest. its not an average time sort of question

    yea p much. so its x/100 + 1 until thats j as slow as the y/100 + 2 and then ppl equally follow both routes until the constant 3 hour route is the fastest.

     If 400 people go on the middle route, then the travel times on the other two routes are 1 and 2 (which are less than 3). When those people on the z route see that the other two routes have shorter times, they'll want to switch routes, meaning there isn't a Nash eq at z=400.
