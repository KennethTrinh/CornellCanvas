  Confused as to why the answer for 3c can't just be z = 400, x = 0, y = 0. This equilibrium still means average the total travel time is 3 hours?

  bc ppl will always take the fastest route until it becomes slower than the next fastest. its not an average time sort of question

  If 400 people go on the middle route, then the travel times on the other two routes are 1 and 2 (which are less than 3). When those people on the z route see that the other two routes have shorter times, they'll want to switch routes, meaning there isn't a Nash eq at z=400.

  yea p much. so its x/100 + 1 until thats j as slow as the y/100 + 2 and then ppl equally follow both routes until the constant 3 hour route is the fastest.
