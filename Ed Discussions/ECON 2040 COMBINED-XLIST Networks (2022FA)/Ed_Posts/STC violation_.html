 We've said that if STC is not violated, then it is satisfied; a node violates the STC Property if it has strong ties to two nodes, but those two nodes have no edge between them.
</p>
<p>
 To clarify, does this mean that a prerequisite for being considered for STC is to have 2 strong nodes in the first place?
 <b>
  For example, on 3(c) of PSET 1, if a node cannot have 2 strong ties, then is it true that it would neither satisfy nor violate the STC property?

  By the definition of STC, like you said above, if STC is not violated, then it is satisfied. In order for STC to be violated, there must be two strong ties AND the two nodes have no edge between them. Thus, if either (or both) of those conditions are false, then we can say that STC is not violated and is therefore satisfied.
 </p>
 <p>
  In your example, if a node cannot have two strong ties, then it isn't possible for it to violate STC. Thus, the node satisfies STC. For a better explanation, see ch. 3, pg. 54 in the textbook
