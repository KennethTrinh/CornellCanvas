  Why would 7.5 and 4.5 be a nash bargaining solution?

  I think the answer key may be wrong here - let me explain. This would be a Nash Bargaining solution for nodes A and B if everything stayed the same - B has an outside option of 3, A has an outside option of 0, and they split the surplus. However, once B's amount changes,
  <italic>
   the outside options for C and D also change
  </italic>
  , causing them to need to change the amount they get according to the Nash Bargaining Outcome, causing a ripple throughout the network.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I believe the true Nash Bargaining Outcome would be B/C/D getting $8 and A/E/F getting $4 - does this help?

  I believe the answer key is not wrong for 7b? Your answer refers to 7c rather than 7b. Here's the calculation for 7b:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  total value: 9+3=12
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  surplus = total value - all outside options = 12-3-0=9
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  nash outcome solution for A = outside option + 1/2*surplus = 0+9/2=4.5
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  nash outcome solution for B = outside option + 1/2*surplus = 3+9/2=7.5
 </paragraph>

  Yes, but this affects C and D's outside options, making them have to shift as well. Another way to look at it is that my solution is a Nash Bargaining Outcome, and there's only ever one of those. If 7c is the Nash Bargaining Outcome, then 7.5 and 4.5 can't also be it, right? The answer seems to assert that it's the Nash Bargaining Outcome for the entire network, whereas the values are for only A and B, not considering their effect on the entire network

  The solution is correct, but I understand your logic. The values of 9 and 3 do not represent a balanced outcome because the Nash bargaining solution does not line up with our original values. The solution to 7b gives the values of 4.5 and 7.5 to show that the Nash bargaining solution in this case does not line up with our values of 9 and 3.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  In 7c, on the other hand, our starting values (8 and 4) do produce a Nash bargaining solution that matches. Thus, the values in 7c provide a balanced outcome.

  Yeah, it absolutely does!
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  So basically Nash Bargaining Outcome is true when the
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  (outside option + (surplus/2)) = initial value
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For example in 7c:
 </paragraph>
 <list style="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    surplus/2 = 4
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
 </list>
 <list style="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    Therefore, 4 + 4 = 8
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
 </list>

  Exactly! A has an outside option of 0, and B has an outside option of 4. This gives a surplus of 8 between the two (total value of 12 - A's outside option - B's outside option), so splitting it between them, B gets 8 and A gets 4
