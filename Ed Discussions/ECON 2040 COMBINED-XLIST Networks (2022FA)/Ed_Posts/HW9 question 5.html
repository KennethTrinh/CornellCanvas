 For question 5, do the values of x and y have to be the values that fully minimize disease spread, or can any values that potentially do better than the current allocation be acceptable?

  The values that fully minimizes disease spread is not required (might be easier to calculate though) but it is necessary to show why your proposed plan is better than the original if such plan exists. Check out chapter 21 and the basic reproductive number for more information.
