  I have completed the practice prelim and gone over the psets. Would reviewing the questions at the end of each chapter be a good way to review (do they mirror questions that could potentially be on the exam)?

  Doing the questions at the end of each chapter can be helpful, but do note that there are no solutions available. I would also recommend doing the practice questions on the edx course as another way to review.
