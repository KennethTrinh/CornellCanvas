 I thought all perfect matchings were social welfare maximizing since the prices are market clearing. Thus, I'm not sure how it's possible to create a graph such that the social welfare maximization and the baseline maximization are different from each other, since every perfect match would be social maximizing.

 I feel like my thinking is off here. Could someone help point me in the right direction for approaching the problem? Thanks!

  I am having the same problem, but I am guessing that the problem does not state that the perfect matching has to come from the round system, but any way to create a perfect match, even if it is not possible under normal pricing circumstances. I am not sure but thought I would share my interpretation. Otherwise, I agree, it would not be possible.

   What Ryan says is correct - you can construct perfect matchings without using the algorithm. Such matchings are not always welfare-maximizing. Please see #144 for more detail
