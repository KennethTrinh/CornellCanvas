  Neither in the book or in class, and the topic doesn’t even have a wiki. It has one book on the subject but other than that it’s the textbook.

  So, where can we go to better learn it? What’s the algorithm or thought process for solving such problems?

  It is explained with multiple examples over 30 pages in Chapter 12, so not quite sure what you want - any confusion/problem in particular? This may just be my experience, but I found lecture to go through examples really well, and always available for questions after. The TA's and course staff are also generous enough to offer a plentiful selection of office hours every day, in case you have any confusion. Really hard to address (and somewhat insulting to the course staff taking their time to teach, imo) just saying "not explained well" without giving any specific confusion, lack of understanding, concepts, or problems
