 I am unsure if it is assumed or not, but do buyers' expectations change in parts b and c from part a. I.e., do buyers know the mix of cars being sold in parts b and c?

  The buyers know the overall mix of cars for all problems. However, the probability of buying a given quality of car may change depending on which equilibria you're analyzing
