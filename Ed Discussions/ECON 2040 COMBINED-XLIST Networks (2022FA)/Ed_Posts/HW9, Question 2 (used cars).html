  I noticed that in question 3, the problem statement directly says that the seller is willing to sell the good at a price greater than or
  <bold>
   equal to
  </bold>
  their value for that good. However, in question 2, I don't think it is specified. Should I also assume that the seller will sell the product in the same manner if the price is equal to the value? (I am hesitant to assume this because it doesn't really make sense in real life, selling something for a profit of $0)

  Citing the problem in Chapter 22.6, if the price is equal to the value, then the seller
  <bold>
   will
  </bold>
  sell (the "real-life" intuition is that with a payoff of 0, the seller could go either way, so if there's a buyer that's pressuring them to sell at that price, they would probably do so.)

  As an aside, I hesitate to use the word "profit", as that could be worked into their payoff - ex. they need x amount of profit on a purchase to stay afloat as a business/pay their workers and earn 0 payoff overall. I think payoff in general provides a cleaner description of one's motivation - they will do something if they get a positive payoff (as well as a seller's "value" isn't well-defined; cost to make? What they need to pay their workers in addition?)
