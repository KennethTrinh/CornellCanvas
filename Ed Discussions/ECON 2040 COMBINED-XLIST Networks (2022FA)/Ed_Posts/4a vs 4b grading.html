 Hi, for 4a, I made an arithmetic mistake which gave me the wrong values for x and y (giving me a 2/4), but all of my other work was correct. For part 4b, in the grading it says "Give one point back if answers are all wrong, but a reasonable attempt at finding travel times was made." I got all of 4b correct, but I was wondering does this point also apply to 4a? Thank you so much and let me know!

  Assuming you are referring to HW 3, this grading structure was to avoid over-penalizing if you used incorrect calculations or interpretations from 4a that continued in 4b. Since 4a is a 4-point problem, a correct
  <i>
   x
  </i>
  ,
  <i>
   y
  </i>
  ,
  <i>
   z
  </i>
  , and a reasonable attempt are each worth one point. (It sounds like you got the point for z and the reasonable attempt, 2/4).
