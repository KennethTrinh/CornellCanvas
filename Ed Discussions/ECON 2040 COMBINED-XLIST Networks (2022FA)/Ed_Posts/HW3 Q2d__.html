  We are given that the buys can have the value 5,10,15. So for question 2d, does that mean if two bidders choose to pay 5 and 10 then the person who pays 10 would get the item at a price of 10?

  It depends on the posted price. If the posted price is at or beneath the values of the two buyers, then the seller randomly picks one of the buyers to sell to (regardless of which one is higher). That buyer will pay the posted price. In your scenario, if the posted price was 5, then either one of the buyers could receive the item and would get it at a price of 5. If the posted price was higher, then whoever's value is at or higher than the posted price will try to get the item and the seller will pick a buyer to sell to (if there is more than one). They will pay the posted price.
