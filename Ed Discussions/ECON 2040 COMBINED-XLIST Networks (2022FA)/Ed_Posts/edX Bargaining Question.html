 Why are these values stable? I thought it would be A = 1/4, B = 3/4, C = 0, D = 3/4, E = 1/4 because B and D's outside option equals to 1/2 and thus the surplus is 1/2.

  stable just means that the sum of the values on an edge between neighboring nodes = 1. it's not the same as a Nash bargaining outcome - the example you're describing leaves the edges between B - C and C - D unstable, because 0 + 3/4 is less than 1.
