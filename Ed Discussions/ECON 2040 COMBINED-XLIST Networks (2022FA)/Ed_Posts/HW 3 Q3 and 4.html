 Can either x, y, or z be 0? i.e., in a Nash Equilibrium is it acceptable to have a value of 0 for any of the numbers? Also, on a 2-way highway, can the value of x, y, or z be negative?

  Think about what a negative number might mean - in order to have that road have the equilibrium time, there must be negative cars on it! Would that road really be in use at that point?

   The number of cars on a road can be 0, but not negative.
