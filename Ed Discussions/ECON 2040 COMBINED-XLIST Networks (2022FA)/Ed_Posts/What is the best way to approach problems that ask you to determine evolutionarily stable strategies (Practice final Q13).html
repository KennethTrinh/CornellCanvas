  Is it to first determine pure Nash equilibria and see if there is a strictly dominant strategy? What if there does not exist a strictly dominant strategy?

  One way to approach ESS problems is to find the pure and/or mixed NE first (say for instance (X,X) ), then to consider the payoffs in the case that a small fraction of the population (a) uses one of the strategies and the rest uses the other. There is a great example of this in the text book (

  https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/networks-book/networks-book-ch07.pdf, the Body-Size/Beetle game on pg 211). The book ends up walking through the entire process.

  A little bit later in that chapter, the Stag Hunt game (figure 7.4) shows an instance of a game without a strictly dominant strategy.
