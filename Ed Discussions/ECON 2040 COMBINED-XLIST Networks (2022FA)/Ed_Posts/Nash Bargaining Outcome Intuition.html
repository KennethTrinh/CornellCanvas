  I understand the process, but I don't intuitively understand why the surplus is split. Can anyone help? Thanks.

  The surplus can be viewed as the total amount of leeway two nodes have in their deal. Let's have an example with Node A and B making a deal to split a value of 1, with outside options of x and y, respectively. In order to do a deal, Node A wants at least x, and Node B wants at least y. If we give each of these Nodes at least their outside option, we're left with the "surplus" of 1-(x+y).

 <paragraph>
  This surplus could be divided in any number of ways that would cause the deal to occur (as it would still mean that both nodes would get more than their outside option). However, if we assume that we want to treat the nodes "fairly" (for some definition of fair), we want each to get the same amount above what they might get otherwise. Because of this, we split this surplus equally among them, so that Node A gets x+(1/2)S, and B gets y+(1/2)S. Hopefully this helps?
