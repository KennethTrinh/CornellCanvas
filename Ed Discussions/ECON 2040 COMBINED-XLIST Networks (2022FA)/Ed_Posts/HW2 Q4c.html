  We can assume the rule here holds for a pair of a given city and F right? So for example F and K would be enemies since they are a distance of 5 away from each other. And B and F are allies since they are a distance of 1 away from each other.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  And this would be the same for 4d (F and a city are enemies if the other city is more than 5 away from F, etc)?

  Yes, your reasoning is correct. You can think of F as being a distance of 0 away from F, which satisfies the criteria "distance at most three from city F"
