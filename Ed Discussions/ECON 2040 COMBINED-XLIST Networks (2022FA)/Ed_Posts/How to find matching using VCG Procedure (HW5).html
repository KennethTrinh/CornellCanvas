 I am confused how the VCG procedure can help to find the optimal matching. As we are only taught how to find prices using VCG. And the only method for calculating optimal perfect matching as for I know is marketing clearing price method.

  You just mentioned a method to find the "optimal" (in the sense of overall valuation) matching that is still valid. The VCG method is meant to take that matching and determine prices that create the correct incentives (truthful bidding).

  With this problem though, a better method might be the one described in Question 4. Although it is in the context of a generalized second-price auction (so we can't use the prices determined by it), both the GSPA and VCG use the matching that maximizes total valuation, so we can use the matching that it describes.
