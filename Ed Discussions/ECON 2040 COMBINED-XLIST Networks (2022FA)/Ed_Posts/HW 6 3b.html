  How do we go about determining how student 2 picks if they draw blue? Is it safe to say that there'd be 1 blue and 1 red drawing meaning they're equal in MB/MR or I am I taking the wrong approach here?

  Not quite - since the urns themselves aren't symmetric, we can't assume symmetry in probability for equal draws. You need to go through the entire conditional probability reasoning, which factors in this asymmetry
