  How we would go about finding the nash equilibrium for values x, y, and z for this problem? I know the equilibrium time is 3 hours because ADCB is a dominant strategy. Is ACB and ADB strictly dominated so that means that x = 0, y = 0, and z = 400?

  if x = 0, y = 0, and z = 400, there is not an equilibrium -- the top and bottom routes will both have travel times that are less than 3, meaning people will want to switch routes (from ADCB to one of the other two). if you know that the ADCB route has a travel time of 3, a good way to find an equilibrium might be to try to solve for x and y when the total time for their routes = 3 (ex: x/100 + 1 = 3).

  That makes total sense. Just a few questions about Braess's Paradox:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1. What is the purpose of finding dominant or dominated strategies as the first step of these types of questions? How do you find them?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. In what cases, do you automatically make the route = 0 travelers?

  Braess's Paradox (adding the C-D road decreases the travel time)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1) The purpose is to be able to eliminate roads - if a road is dominant, then travellers will always choose to take it, no matter what other travellers do. Likewise, if a road is dominated, then travelers will never choose to take it, no matter what other travellers do
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2) When the route is a dominated strategy - see above (its travel time is always longer than another route's)

  To find the dominated or dominant strategy, would I plug in numbers of the equilibrium without the middle bridge? This way I will see which route is fastest and which route is slowest? How can I mathematically prove that the the slowest route is the dominated strategy and that it should be =0?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If I do come across a route that is dominated and =0, should I ignore that and do system of equations on the other routes?

  A route is dominated if it is always worse than some other route. You can find this by comparing the travel times, and showing that the travel time for a given route will always be more than another route (making it dominated)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Not sure what you mean by a route being = 0 - in travel time, that would mean that travellers would switch to take it take it, but if there were 0 travellers on the route in all scenarios, that would make it a dominated strategy
