  When we think of an optimal matching when removing a certain buyer, do we use the perfect matching gotten from market clearing prices to see whether a buyer gets a different item or do we focus on trying to maximize the individual buyer's payoff once the buyer is removed. For example, if in a perfect matching x is only connected to a, but y is connected to b and c and z is connected to c, if x is removed, if the original value for a for y (disregarding market clearing prices) is higher than what it gets in the perfect match, does it receive a or does it keep b, because there is no connection between y and a in the perfect matching?

  Y would receive a. The perfect matching you're referencing was computed with X present, but if X isn't present, the way to maximize welfare may involve a different matching from buyers to items. The problem would essentially be re-computed with X not there (which would result in Y getting a)
