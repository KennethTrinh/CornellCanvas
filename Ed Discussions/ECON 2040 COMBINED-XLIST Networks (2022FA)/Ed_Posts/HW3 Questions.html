 Q1
</p>
<p>
 1) Is the question asking if it's true that you need to bid higher than 30 to win?
</p>
<p>
 Q2
</p>
<p>
 2) "the object will be sold to highest bidder at the maximum of the second highest bid and the reserve price."
</p>
<p>
 Does this mean that the highest bidder pays the second highest bid + the reserve price, or does it mean that the highest bidder pays whatever is higher (if the reserve price is higher than the second highest bid, then they'll pay the reserve price)?
</p>
<p>
 Q2(a)
</p>
<p>
 3)
</p>
<p>
 I approached this problem by using the formula described in chapter 9.7.B. Which is : (n-1)/(n+1), where n represents the number of bidders (In this case I assumed its is 2). Am I on the right path here? Or is the question asking to create an expression based on the probabilities of the values of the bidders being 5, 10, or 15?
