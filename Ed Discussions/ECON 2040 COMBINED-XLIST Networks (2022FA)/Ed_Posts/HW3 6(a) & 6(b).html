 <paragraph>
  In 6(b) the problem statement says:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  "If you ran the procedure to construct market-clearing prices in part (a) correctly, you’ll have discovered that the perfect matching M it finds — which we know is welfare maximizing — consists of the pairs a-x, b-y, and c-z. It has social welfare 10 + 10 + 10 = 30, and no other perfect matching has higher social welfare."
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Does this perfect Matching M correspond to the sum of the values a single buyer has for the items from a, b, and c at the end of the auction. Or does it correspond to the sum of the market clearing prices each buyer has perfectly matched to at the end of the auction... or something else.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  In other words, what does M correspond to here?

  The perfect matching M consists of the pairs a-x, b-y, c-z in the instance that the problem statement is describing. The matching M itself is just those pairs of buyers and sellers.
