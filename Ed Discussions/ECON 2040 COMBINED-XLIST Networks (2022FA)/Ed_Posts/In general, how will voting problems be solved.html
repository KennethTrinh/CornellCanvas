<p>
 What aspects of voting preferences need to be considered for such a problem?
</p>
<p>
 I would assume that a third ranking would have to have X as greater than Y, to preserve transitivity, but perhaps X&gt;Z&gt;Y. the majority rule here would preserve transitivity and make X the winner. However, is transitivity relevant? is majority rule relevant? there's no similar problem worked out in the voting chapter
