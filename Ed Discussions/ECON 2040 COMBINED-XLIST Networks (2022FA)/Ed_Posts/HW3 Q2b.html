  For question 2b, I tried making an expression from the probabilities (suggested in #142) but I’m getting a value with a decimal, which doesn’t make sense. Should the expected revenue be one of 5, 10, or 15?

  Not necessarily. Each value pairing occurs with some probability, so even though the revenue from a single one of those possibilities will be an integer in this case, it is entirely possible that the expected revenue is a decimal value.

  Here is an example to help think about this: I tell you I am going to give you either 1 dollar or 2 dollars. Further, I tell you that there is a 50% chance of either possibility occurring. What is the expected amount that you will receive from me?
