  If we look at the formula of inverse equilibrium odds, we can see that it reliant on two things: share of wealth of each individual buyer and their belief that something (horse A in terms of the pset) wins. So, after one race, the bettors have received some payoff (wealth is redistributed, think about the new wealth shares) and we keep the same values of p and q (in the pset at least). Thus, our inverse equilibrium odds must now take these changes into account. Hope this helps!
