  The question states that "there is a strong tie between each student on the first floor and each student on the second floor" etc. Is this saying that a student on the first floor has ties to all 20 students living on the second floor and vice versa? Or is it just saying that each student on the first floor has a tie to another individual student on the second floor.

  does a strong tie between each student on the first floor and each student on the second floor mean the students within the floors have strong ties with each other? or within the floors are the only strong ties the pairs of roommates?

  When we say "there is a strong tie between each student on the first floor and each student on the second floor," we mean that every student on the first floor shares a strong tie with every student on the second floor (and vice versa).

  When we say that "there is a strong tie between each pair of people who live on the same floor," we mean that all students on a single floor share a strong tie with

   all

  other students on that floor. (When we talk about "pairs" of people, we don't mean roommates, but rather any two people on the floor.)
