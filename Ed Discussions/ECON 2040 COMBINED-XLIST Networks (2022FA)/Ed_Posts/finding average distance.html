  to find the average distance from one node to every other, I've been adding up all the distances and dividing that by the number of nodes in the graph, but I'm not sure if that should also include that original node we would be going from to every other node. For example, if your graph has 4 nodes and you're getting the distance from one node to the three other nodes, would you do:

 <paragraph>
  total distance/4, or total distance/3?

  Thank you! :)

  You do not need to include the original node. So in your example of a 4-node graph you would have total distance/3
