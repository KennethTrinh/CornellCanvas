 So I was looking at other EdStem posts on how to calculate new wealth shares and, to me, it seems as if there is two different methods for calculating it.
</p>
<p>
 This was a response to the process for Homework 9 Q1:
</p>
<p>
 new wealth = x*O_A / total wealth
</p>

 This was a response to the process for 14c on the practice final:

<p>
 Why do these differ?
</p>
<p>
 Would someone be able to clarify this for me? Thanks!

  Focus on the part of your first screenshot where it talks about the better's new wealth instead of their new wealth
  <i>
   share
  </i>
  . Also note that it's a dominant strategy to bet beliefs, so $x = a_n w_n$. The two are actually the same.
