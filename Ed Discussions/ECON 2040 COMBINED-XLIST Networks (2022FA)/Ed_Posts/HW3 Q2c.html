  First, should we subtract the price of the object (10) from the revenue? Or since it has no value, we shouldn't? Or alternatively, should we only consider the value to be 10 when the item is sold?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Secondly, if a bidder assigns a value of 10 to the object, does he bid it? Because all possible payoffs would be 0, so he could also bid anything between 0 and 10 and that would make no difference to his payoff. (This question only matters depending on the answer to the first question).

  1) There is no reason to subtract 10 from the revenue. A "reserve price" is a notion come up with by the seller to attempt to change how the auction functions in their favor. They will still get revenue equal to the amount they sell it for (as they had no value for it before selling)

  2) From the problem, "As usual we will assume that a bidder with value v who has an opportunity to buy the object for a price of v will attempt to buy the object. "
