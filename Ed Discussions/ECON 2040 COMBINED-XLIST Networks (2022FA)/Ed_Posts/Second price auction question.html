 If there are 2 highest bidders for 2 items in a second price auction, how much do they pay?
</p>
<p>
 Does the highest bidder and the second highest bidder both equally pay the third highest bid?

  Hi! Thanks for your question.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the event of a tie for the highest bid of a second-price auction, the winner would pay the value of their bid because the next bid is the same as their own. In other words, if two bidders submit a bid of $20 and a third person submits a $17 bid, the winner would pay $20â€”that's the price of second place.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are multiple ways of determining which of the tied highest bidders is the winner, though. One intuitive way is a first-come, first-served system based on who submits their high bid first.

   I don't think that it was covered explicitly in lecture (would probably depend on the exact auction), so I think if it were given in a problem, it would specify. That being said, it's unlikely that two bidders would have the

   same value in real life
