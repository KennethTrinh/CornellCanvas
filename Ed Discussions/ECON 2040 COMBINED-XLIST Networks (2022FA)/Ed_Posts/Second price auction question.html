  I don't think that it was covered explicitly in lecture (would probably depend on the exact auction), so I think if it were given in a problem, it would specify. That being said, it's unlikely that two bidders would have the

  Hi! Thanks for your question.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  In the event of a tie for the highest bid of a second-price auction, the winner would pay the value of their bid because the next bid is the same as their own. In other words, if two bidders submit a bid of $20 and a third person submits a $17 bid, the winner would pay $20â€”that's the price of second place.

  There are multiple ways of determining which of the tied highest bidders is the winner, though. One intuitive way is a first-come, first-served system based on who submits their high bid first.
