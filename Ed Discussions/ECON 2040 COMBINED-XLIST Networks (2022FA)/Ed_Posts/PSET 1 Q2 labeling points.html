  Hi, for Question 2, when it asked us to draw a scene, it says to include a label for where each point is. I'm quite confused by this requirement: it seems every node has been labeled.

 <paragraph>
  Can we draw the polygons on the figures provided directly? In this case, I don't understand how to label the nodes since they have already been labeled by A, B, C, etc.

 <paragraph>
  Thanks for any hints.

  The labels are the letters already given (A, B, C, etc.), so if you were to draw a new scene, you would place those labels by the corresponding nodes. I would recommend drawing a new scene rather than over the figures provided to avoid clutter and confusion, but if that is not possible, then I would provide an additional explanation for what you drew over the figure so that we can interpret it better.

  Thank you so much; that makes sense. And would like to make sure, for part 2a, can we draw the edges directly on the figure provided?
