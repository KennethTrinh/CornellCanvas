  Yes. Consider a two node graph where the nodes share an edge. Also, suppose that node A gets 0 and node B gets 1 if A and B are in an exchange. This is a stable outcome because there is no case where the sum of the values of two nodes is &lt; 1. This isn't a Nash bargaining outcome, because both of the node's outside options are 0, meaning that in Nash bargaining, they both share a surplus of 1. So 1/2, 1/2 is actually Nash bargaining and not 0, 1.
