  I have my blog post ready, and I am able to log into the course blog. However, I do not see an option for creating a post anywhere -- on the navigation bar at the top, I only see the options of "log out" and "create site". What should I do to create a blog post?

  This most likely means that you are not registered as a user on the course blog.

  Go to the opening blog post and follow the instructions there:
