 does this indicates that if the only pure strategy is (A, B) or (B,A) instead of (A, A) and (B,B). Then there is no evolutionary game theory without calculation needed?

  Your statement is true, though I'm not sure it's obvious why (you may want to explain it on an exam). If (A,B) or (B,A) is a NE, then that means the best response of a player to the other player's strategy is to choose the other strategy. This means that in an evolutionary state, where most of the people play one strategy, the best response is to pick the other, making the initial strategy not evolutionarily stable.
