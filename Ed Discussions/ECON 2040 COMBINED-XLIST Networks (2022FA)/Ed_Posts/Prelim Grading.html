  Is there a planned date/time period where we can expect to receive our results from the prelim?

  It will be before the drop deadline so you can make an informed decision about whether you want to continue with the class. My guess is some time next week

  To add on to Brandon's answer, we plan to time grading such that you have at least the weekend preceding the drop deadline to review your midterm/progress in the course.
