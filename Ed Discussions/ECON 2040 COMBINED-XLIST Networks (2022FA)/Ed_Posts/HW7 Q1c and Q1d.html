 When we are given the fraction of potential users initially using the product, how do we know whether the trend is upward or downward?
</p>
<p>
 Am I right in thinking that if the fraction is between the upper and lower bound of z, then we can assume that the trend is upward (increase in popularity)?
</p>
<p>
 Or, is it the case that the market and fraction of users would stabilize at the closest equilibrium (either z' or z")?
</p>
<p>
 Is there a way we need to show this mathematically?

  I don't believe either of these cases are correct (certainly not to the closest equilibria, and I'm not sure what you mean by "upper and lower bound")
 </p>
 <p>
  When looking at an operating point (a value of z), consider consumer x, where x=z. More importantly, consider the consumers directly greater or less than them (for larger or smaller values of x). If z were to shift (slightly) in that direction, would those consumers buy the product? (Remember that if a consumer's reservation price is above the price, they will buy, and if it is below, they will not)
 </p>
 <p>
  Let's consider the case when we analyze a small shift to the right of z. If those new consumers (greater value of x) would buy, then the shift would continue, until we get to a point where the new consumers that would result from the shift wouldn't buy. If these new consumers instead wouldn't buy the product, then z would decrease and shift back to where it was previously
