  We know that a self-fulfilling expectations equilibrium in which only bad and medium exists, since the buyer's expected value is 10, which is less than the seller’s value of a good car (14) but greater than the seller’s value for medium (8) or bad cars (2).

 <paragraph>
  I was wondering, if the seller's value of the good car decreases from 14 to 9, will the equilibrium exist?

  This is a good question. My intuition would be no, because the buyer expects only bad and medium cars to be sold but there is a possibility that good cars will also be sold as the buyer's expected value is higher than the seller's value for good cars. Thus, since we cannot say that
  <italic>
   only
  </italic>
  bad and medium cars will be sold, we do not have an equilibrium.

  In the past, I think we have assumed that the seller will sell cars uniformly given a willingness to buy at or above their value for the car; that is, if a buyer has a willingness to pay at or above the value of some subset of the cars (i.e. bad, bad and medium, bad medium and good) then all those types of cars beneath that value will be sold. With this assumption, our conclusion seems to hold.
