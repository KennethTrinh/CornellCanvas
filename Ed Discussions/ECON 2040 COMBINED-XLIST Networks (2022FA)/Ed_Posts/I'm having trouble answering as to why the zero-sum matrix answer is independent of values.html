  I see that it is, but I'm not sure how I should go about answering how or why. It resembles a fundamental case of the odd-even game, but can we conclude that any odd even game is like this? I doubt it.

  You do not need to explain it in terms of any odd even game, but rather just focus the matrix in the problem and the role of w and l in determining the mixed Nash equilibrium.
