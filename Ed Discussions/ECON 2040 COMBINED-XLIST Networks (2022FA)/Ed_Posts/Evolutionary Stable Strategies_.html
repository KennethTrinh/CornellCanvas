 Is it possible for a mixed Nash equilibrium to be an evolutionary stable strategy? How would those calculations work?

  I don't believe so - hard to show, but I couldn't come up with an example for one that did. It doesn't really fall under our definition though - we're more concerned with the population as a whole trending towards a pure strategy, and I couldn't think of a time when they'd naturally trend towards a mix of strategies.

  If nothing else, a simple way to look at it is with the definition from class;
  <i>
   "A strategy is ESS if, when 1-x use it and a small fraction x use the other strategy, the payoff is greater than the payoff to the other strategy"
  </i>
  . With a mixed strategy, what would the "other" strategy be?
