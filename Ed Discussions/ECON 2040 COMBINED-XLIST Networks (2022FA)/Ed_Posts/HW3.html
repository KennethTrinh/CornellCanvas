  Can the Nash Equilibrium travel time be the constant travel time route if it is the dominant strategy? Or do the cost of the routes all have to be the same even if there is a better option for all travelers to use one route that isn't dependent on how many travelers there are?

  It can be the constant travel time route if any other routes have a portion of constant travel time which is larger.

  One thing that may help; say we have two roads, one with constant travel time, and the other with travel time proportional to the number of travelers. A Nash Equilibrium will not occur with everyone on the constant travel time route, as then the variable time route would have zero travel time, and drivers would switch over to that route (until the travel time reached what point?)

  Wouldn't the travelers use the variable time route until it became equivalent or greater than the constant time? Although the NE will not occur with everyone on the constant time travel route, is it possible the travel time of that route will be the NE travel time? I am struggling to understand the impact of Project 1 on the traffic network in 4b. Thanks!

  Yes, it is possible that the NE travel time will be equal to the constant path. This occurs when the constant path is pretty good, so you balance out the proportion-based routes to create indifference between the two routes (as Aidan said).
