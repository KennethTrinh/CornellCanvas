  I saw on the syllabus that everything for the homework has to be typed out. Are we allowed to draw the diagrams and then insert them as part of the document, or should we find a way to manually put the diagram together on whatever document editor we use?

  Yes, you are allowed to draw the diagrams and then insert your drawing(s) into the document. Visual representations can be created either by hand or online, as long as everything is eventually inserted into the same document.
