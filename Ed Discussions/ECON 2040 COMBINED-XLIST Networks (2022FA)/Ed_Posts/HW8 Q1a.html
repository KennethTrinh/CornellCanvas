  Hi, I wonder if for Q1(a) "Suppose the new behavior A is introduced at node 1. Which nodes will eventually adopt the behavior A beginning from this starting point?" we need to include node 1 in our answer?

  Thanks.

  In short, you don't have to include node 1.

  This question asks you to describe the spread, which is the process for other nodes (only if they will be influenced to change their behavior) to adopt behavior A.
