 I would like to follow up on #368, since although I appreciate Aidan's answer, I get the impression that we are both somewhat guessing at what the intended interpretation of the problem's wording is.
</p>
<p>
 Whether or not we normalize after the first step will affect our "before final-normalization" answers, which are specifically asked for in parts a and c (and thus there is presumably an intended "correct answer" as to whether we should normalize between rounds or not). Since the instructions are not super clear as to whether we should normalize after both the first round and second round or just after the second round, I would like clarification from someone on the course staff about the intended expectation for the algorithm in this problem. Thanks!

  I cannot provide a conclusive answer as I unfortunately don't know exactly what is expected from the question (didn't write the HW) but I will say that I personally did not normalize until the very end for a very similar question in a previous semester and it was fine.

  If any course staff that knows wants to chip in feel free
