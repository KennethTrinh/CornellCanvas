 I was confused on how to deal with the three consecutive days part of this question. When it says 3 consecutive days does that mean we cube the answer that we got from Bayes Rule?

  Not quite - if you did so, you would be cubing all of the components of Bayes' Rule, some of which are true in general regardless of the time frame (and therefore shouldn't be cubed). Instead, can you think of which components might differ from one day versus three days? How would you take your answer for one day, and use it for three consecutive days?

   Once we identify the components that would be different for three consecutive days, we would cube it?

    There is definitely cubing involved, but think carefully about at what stage you would cube it. For the values given in the problem, you only need to cube one of them to account for the three consecutive days
