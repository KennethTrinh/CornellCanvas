  In the visibility graphs given, only two polygons are used in each. Is this also a requirement for when we have to make our own visibility graphs in the problems?

  No, it is not a requirement for you to use only two polygons. As long as your design fulfills the requirements specified on the questions, you may use whatever shapes in any numbers.
