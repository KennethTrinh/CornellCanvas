  Right - so this is because we now receive information about the
  <italic>
   payoffs
  </italic>
  that previous people have received.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If the technology is bad, then the incorrect cascade would happen with acceptances. However, later people can also see the payoffs, and would be able to include that information in their guess (whether the average is positive or negative) in addition to their own to make the best guess. This can't result in an incorrect cascade, as the people can base their guess on all other payoffs (which indicate quality of the technology), and not just off of the guesses. If we receive information indicating that the technology is bad, but two previous users have accepted, we won't necessarily accept, but can use the overall payoffs to make the best guess.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  However, in the case that the technology is good, then the incorrect cascade would occur with rejections. Since rejections always result in a payoff of zero, knowing the payoffs gives us no more information than the guess of previous players. Because of this, we are still in the same scenario as before with cascades; if our signal indicates the technology is good, but two previous users have rejected, then we will still reject, resulting in an incorrect cascade.
