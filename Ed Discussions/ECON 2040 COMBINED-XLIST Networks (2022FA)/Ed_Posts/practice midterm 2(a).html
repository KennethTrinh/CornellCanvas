  Do we need to explain as the solution does or we can just write (U,L) and (D,R) because it only requires as to find the pure strategy Nash equilibria but does not require us to explain.

  Nope, you just need to write it down - it doesn't say you need to explain (as stated in class). That being said, I imagine that it might be easier to award partial credit (if there is some available) if work is shown rather than just stating an incorrect answer
