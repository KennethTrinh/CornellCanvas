  For this question, would we need to use Bayes' rule and show the calculations or can we use the logic that was used in the videos, which was if the person draws a blue ball, they guess blue majority urn, else they guess red majority urn?

  You definitely

  use that logic here (in fact, Part b attempts to highlight this - you would get it wrong using that logic). The reason is because before, the urns were symmetric, whereas here, they are not, so if a player knows about some mix of red and blue draws, it is not as simple as picking the urn with the majority of the most drawn color (a different urn might still be more likely for that mix).

  While this would work for the first person (a reasonably simple case), it doesn't generalize well when other players have to make complicated decisions based on their draw and the decisions made by those before them, as well as when the probabilities of the urns aren't equal (as in Question 2) - Bayes' Rule is the best/most concrete way to tackle this
