  For each strategy, give the probability. For example, for player A, give the probability of playing up or down. Similarly, for player B, give the probability of playing left or right. (so P(U) = __, P(D) = __, P(L) = __, P(R) = __)
 </p>

   Is it enough to say that Player 1 plays Strategy U with p=n &amp; Player 2 plays strategy L with q=k? Given each player has two strategies it is implicitly defined that D is played with p=1-n &amp; R is played with q=1-k -- does this need to be defined explicitly?

    What you say is true, but we'd like you to explicitly state the final probabilities because it helps us with grading (and giving you credit!)
