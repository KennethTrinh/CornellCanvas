 I'm a little confused...If we do not know the values per click, then how do we assign values for a, b, and c to run the VCG. Does each advertiser now have the same value for slots a, b, and c???

  One thing I would add is that you can think of VCG price as the harm that a bidder does by taking a slot.
 </p>
 <p>
  The advertisers' values are still there, but the search engine doesn't know. The way how VCG achieves price distribution is to use this procedure and set the price that can be interpreted as the harm of a specific bidder taking a slot.
 </p>
 <p>
  I hope this helps you understand the question better.

   This was a key step of the VCG algorithm covered in class - we need to have some sense of value for each buyer, so the algorithm states that each buyer should report a value to be used (since it doesn't know the values outright). The key is figuring out what will be reported.

    Does it means we use the value the report to calculate. We learned in class that they are likely to bid truthfully so the value the report is the true value though the true value is not told?

     Exactly - they are more than likely to bid truthfully; it is a dominant strategy, and buyers would be acting illogically to not do so
