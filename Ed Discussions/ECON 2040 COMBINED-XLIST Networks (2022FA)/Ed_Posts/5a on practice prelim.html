 I don't understand how to draw the diagram for 5a. For the strong triadic closure property to take place, if two nodes have a strong connection there must be atleast one weak connection with a node. What would the three nodes be? Same for 5b, what would the nodes be?

  You must examine all cases of what the three nodes could be (all in a single grade, or across multiple grades). Drawing the entire network isn't necessary, you just have to be able to argue that for any combinations of students, STC will be satisfied
