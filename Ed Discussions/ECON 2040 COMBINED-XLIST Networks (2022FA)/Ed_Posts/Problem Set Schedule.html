 Is there a schedule somewhere for when each problem set will be due? I just want to be able to plan ahead in terms of workload. Thank you!

  Depending on the progress of course content, problem sets release in a varied pace along the whole semester. This would be either bi-weekly or weekly. But they are always due on Thursdays.

  We have 9 problem sets in total if that helps you to plan ahead in terms of workload.

   I have in my notes that sets are always due on Thursdays.  Not sure if they're all bi-weekly though.
