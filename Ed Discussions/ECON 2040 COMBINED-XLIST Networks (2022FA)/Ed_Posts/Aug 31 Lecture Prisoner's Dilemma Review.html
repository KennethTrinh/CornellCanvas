 I had a hard time hearing lecture today, and I plan to read the textbook and/or visit the EdX site, but I wanted ask if there might be another recording I could watch from previous semesters stored somewhere (i.e Zoom recording from 2020)
</p>

 Thanks

  The best recording to watch is the second video in the Games Videos module on Canvas.
