  If node A has strong ties to nodes B and C yet nodes B and C do not have any tie between them it is said that node A violates the Strong Triadic Closure Property. Do we also say that nodes B and C violate this property or just node A?

  You don't say node B or C violates STCP as one of the conditions to say that a node violates STCP is that this node has strong ties to two other nodes.

  In your description, nodes B and C do not have strong ties with two other nodes, and hence, you don't say that nodes B and C violate STCP.
