  Above are the general equations for the Nash Bargaining Solution for any two nodes A and B in which A has outside option x and B has outside option y (note that the total in the example is 1 rather than 12). We can focus on two nodes, A and B. B has outside option 3 (dealing with either C or D) and A has outside option 0. Surplus then is the total amount on the edge (12) subtracted by the two outside options added together (3). We can plug in these values to the equations on the LHS to find the Nash bargaining solution for these values.
