<p>
 for the Midterm question 2b), How do we know if there is NOT a mixed strategy nash equilibria? Can't we apply the p, 1-p, etc. equation either way?

  If you solve and find only one pure strategy NE, there's no reason for the two players to mix strategies or deviate. Often mixed strategy NE are used to figure out the probability of alternating between two NE, since if we have multiple NE we don't know which one the players will end up at.

 <p>
  If you try to apply the p, 1-p etc. to a problem that has a clear dominant strategy or only one NE, you could get probability values like this:

  Since p and q are probabilities, this answer doesn't make sense.
