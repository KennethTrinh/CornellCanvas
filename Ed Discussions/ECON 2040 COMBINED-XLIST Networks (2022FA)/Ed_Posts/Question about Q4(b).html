  I recommend thinking about why there was a value of
  <code>
   q
  </code>
  that you got for Part (a). Why was the spread such that a value of
  <code>
   q
  </code>
  could justify it for the given friend network? (We went over a theorem in lecture about how cluster size can determine whether a behavior spreads completely - maybe try to express it in terms of that?)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Based on that, Part (b) has the spread happening almost inversely of what (a) had. From how we theoretically justified Part (a), try to see if those rules/statements can help you determine an answer for (b)?
