  If pure strategy means that it's the strategy that A or B will stick to no matter what (aka  mutual best response) how is that different from dominant strategy?

  A pure strategy NE just means that two strategies are mutual best responses, but that doesn't mean that those strategies are dominant strategies, which are strategies that result in the best outcome regardless of what the other player chooses.

  An example of this could be a type of coordination game. The best response for if a player chose Powerpoint would be Powerpoint, and the best response for if a player chose Keynote is also Keynote. Thus we have two pure strategy NE: (Powerpoint, Powerpoint) and (Keynote, Keynote). However, none of those are actually dominant strategies, since the best outcome for any player still relies on the choice of the other player.
