  "As usual we will assume that a bidder with value v who has an opportunity to buy the object for a price of v will attempt to buy the object. So, for example, if a bidders value is v, the seller sets a reserve price of v, and the buyer has an opportunity to buy the good at the reserve price then the buyer will buy."

  Could someone please rephrase this/provide an example? I don't quite understand what these two sentences mean.

  If I value an object at $5 and the seller offered to sell it to me for $5, I would buy it.

  If the bidder's value is below the price, they won't buy it. If I value something at $1, but you're selling at $5, I won't buy it. If the bidder values something over or at the selling price, they'll buy it.
