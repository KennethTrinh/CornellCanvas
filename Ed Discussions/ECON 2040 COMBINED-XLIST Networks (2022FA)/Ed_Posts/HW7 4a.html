 For 4a, should we determine whether graphs use the rich-get-richer process through mathematical means or just reasoning?

  Since it's just whether the graphs are "possible", not necessarily "likely", I don't believe mathematical means are necessary. You can determine which of the graphs can arise solely based on what is possible with the rules of the process
