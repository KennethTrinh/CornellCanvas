  For any given cluster, we're usually interested in the

   highest
  </italic>
  density (based on our definition, any cluster could be of density 0, but it's not that useful). To find this, one technique would be to examine all the nodes that have edges crossing the border of the cluster. For each of these nodes, you can find the fraction of edges that they have inside the cluster. The smallest of these fractions would be the greatest density of the overall cluster
