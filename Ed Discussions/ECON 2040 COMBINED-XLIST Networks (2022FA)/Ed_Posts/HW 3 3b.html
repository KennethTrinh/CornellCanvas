 What route is the E route replacing? It says there's a new one-way highway between A and E and E and C, but E wasn't mentioned in 3a, while the question asks to list x, y, and z.

  I don't believe that the new routes between E and other cities are replacing any existing routes from the previous part of the question. We are just incorporating city E into our traffic problem.
