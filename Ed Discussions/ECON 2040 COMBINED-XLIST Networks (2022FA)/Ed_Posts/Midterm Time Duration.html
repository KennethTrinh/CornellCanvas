 If the midterm is in class, do we only have 50 minutes to do all those questions unlike the usual prelim duration of an hour and a half?

  Yes, the exam is 50 minutes long. Just to be clear, the practice midterm contains more questions than what will typically be on the actual exam.

   What about for people with SDS accommodations?

    Unfortunately, I do not know how the arrangements for people with SDS accommodations will work for the exam. I would recommend emailing the professors or posting your question as a separate thread so that other course staff can see.
