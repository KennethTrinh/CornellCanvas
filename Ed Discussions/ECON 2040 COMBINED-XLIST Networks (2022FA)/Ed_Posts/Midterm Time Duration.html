  If the midterm is in class, do we only have 50 minutes to do all those questions unlike the usual prelim duration of an hour and a half?

  Yes, the exam is 50 minutes long. Just to be clear, the practice midterm contains more questions than what will typically be on the actual exam.

  Unfortunately, I do not know how the arrangements for people with SDS accommodations will work for the exam. I would recommend emailing the professors or posting your question as a separate thread so that other course staff can see.
