 Just to clarify, this question is asking for self-fulfilling expectations equilibrium when it says "Is there an equilibrium in which all types of goods are sold?", right?

  If
  <i>
   all
  </i>
  the goods are being traded, it is irrelevant to say it is self fulfilling or not. I think the term exists to determine this:
 </p>
 <p>
  &gt;Buyers have a price they are willing to pay based on the prices of all goods (as they cannot tell the difference between low, average, and superior quality- only sellers know that).
 </p>
 <p>
  &gt;That means the offering price is determined from buyer values, if buyers assume a superior good is not being sold, their overall price drops: Why spend more money if there is 0 probability that you will get a superior good?
 </p>
 <p>
  &gt;If the buyer's reduce the price they are willing to spend, sellers will not see a satisfactory price offered for their superior good, so they will remove it from the market.
 </p>
 <p>
  tl;dr pessimistic buyers can manipulate the market.

   I believe "self-fulfilling" with all goods being traded is still relevant. The only reason the sellers would be willing to sell all goods at the equilibrium is because the buyers would have the expectation that all goods are being sold. Therefore, the expectation from buyers that all goods will be sold fulfills itself when it causes the sellers to want to sell all of the goods
