  As property rights were covered in the last 2 lectures and didn't have any relevant homework questions for them, it's unlikely we'll ask them. Even if we do ask them, it'll be unlikely that we'll ask them in-depth. The practice final is a good indicator of what the actual exam will look like, so if you study the topics that the final exam covers then you should be fine.
