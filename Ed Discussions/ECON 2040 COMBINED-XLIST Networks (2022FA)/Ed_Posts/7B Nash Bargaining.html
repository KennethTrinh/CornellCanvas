 I saw other posts about 7b but I am still a bit confused. They ask "Are the values the nodes get a Nash Bargaining Outcome?".
</p>
<p>
 <underline>
  Outside options:
 </underline>
</p>
<p>
 Node A = 0
</p>
<p>
 Node B = 15-12 = 3
</p>
<p>
 Surplus = t - (outside option for Node A + outside option for Node B) =  15 - (0+3) = 12
</p>
<p>
 Node A gets = outside option + 1/2(surplus) = 3 + 6 = 9
</p>
<p>
 Node B gets = outside option + 1/2(surplus) = 0 + 6 = 6
</p>
<p>
 Are these calculations correct? What am I doing wrong?
</p>

   Outside options:
  </underline>
 </p>
 <p>
  Node A = 0
 </p>
 <p>
  Node B =
  <b>
   12-9=3
  </b>
  (value of edge-what the other node would take, in this case C or D)
 </p>
 <p>
  Surplus =
  <b>
   value of edge
  </b>
  - (outside option for Node A + outside option for Node B) =
  <b>
   12
  </b>
  - (0+3) =
  <b>
   9
  </b>
 </p>
 <p>
  Node A gets = outside option + 1/2(surplus) = 3 +
  <b>
   4.5
  </b>
  =
  <b>
   7.5
  </b>
 </p>
 <p>
  Node B gets = outside option + 1/2(surplus) = 0 +
  <b>
   4.5
  </b>
  =
  <b>
   4.5
  </b>
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing as this isn't what we had before, it isn't a Nash Bargaining Outcome
 </p>
 <p>
  (One immediate error to note is that each edge is worth 12, but in your calculations, A and B splitting the edge would each get 9 and 6, which is more than the edge is worth)
