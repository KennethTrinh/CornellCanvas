  I saw other posts about 7b but I am still a bit confused. They ask "Are the values the nodes get a Nash Bargaining Outcome?".
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <underline>
   Outside options:
  </underline>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Node A = 0
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Node B = 15-12 = 3
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Surplus = t - (outside option for Node A + outside option for Node B) =  15 - (0+3) = 12
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Node A gets = outside option + 1/2(surplus) = 3 + 6 = 9
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Node B gets = outside option + 1/2(surplus) = 0 + 6 = 6
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Are these calculations correct? What am I doing wrong?

  Seeing as this isn't what we had before, it isn't a Nash Bargaining Outcome
 </paragraph>

  (One immediate error to note is that each edge is worth 12, but in your calculations, A and B splitting the edge would each get 9 and 6, which is more than the edge is worth)
