  Can we discuss a specific network's role in an historical event for our blog post? Or does it need to be a recent event or topic?

  Your blog post should refer to a recent source. You can refer to a historical event as long as their is some recent component to your source. Maybe new historical evidence has recently been published or a recent analysis on the historical event?
