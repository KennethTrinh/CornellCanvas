 Can we assume that student 2 does the math to know that p is in the range of values where student 1 will say MB regardless, or do we assume that student 2 believes that student 1 will simply guess their observation and ignore the math?

  Yes - Student 2 is aware of the entire situation, and can accurately analyze the situation that Student 1 faces (we assume that all Students act logically)
