 Does this mean that the exact proportion of the mix of goods that the market believes gets traded, or is it just that some of each type in that mix gets traded?

  In problems like these, I don't believe we'd ever have "some" get traded; either all or none of a type of good get purchased. We assume that we have enough buyers for the goods, so that we really only need to compare expected values (whether a buyer would wish to buy or a seller would wish to sell knowing their expected value)
 </p>
 <p>
  As an aside, in the market, the proportions of types of goods is known by all parties
