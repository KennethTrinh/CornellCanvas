  For this problem, for the impedances to match you must look at both the impedance looking into the emitters of  npn and the pnp correct. Also I am bit confused on how to visualize the small signal model of the self-biased transistor.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Additionally, if both impedances must be considered, how is it possible to know the I_c when the impedance for the self-biased is going to involve the unknown resistor variables.

  The impedance looking into the emitter of a BJT can be approximated as $\frac{1}{g_m}$.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If you draw a small signal model, you have two impedances at the Emitter node (3 if you consider $r_0$ from the Early Effect). One is $r_{\pi}$ going to the Base, and the other goes to the Collector, $\frac{1}{g_m}$.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  You can also further treat the Base and Collector nodes as "AC ground". This means you can treat DC voltages as ground in AC analysis.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Since $ r_{\pi} = \frac{\beta}{g_m}$, and we assume that $\beta$ is large, the parallel combination formed be these two impedances simplifies to just $\frac{1}{g_m}$ (because $\frac{1}{g_m} &lt;&lt; \frac{\beta}{g_m}$)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Note that this corresponds to just one of the two BJTs; consider how you might combine the impedances of both devices to derive an expression for the total input impedance.

  I understand that; however I am talking specifically about the self-biased stage. I don't think looking into the emitter of a self biased stage would still be 1/gm

  That will depend on your choice of R_B2 and R_C2. Go ahead and evaluate the input impedance looking into the bottom transistor (self-biased stage). You should be able to set their values to make your design easier.
