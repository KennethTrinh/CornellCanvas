  How would I go about deriving the current without having the value of vgs?

  There exists a system of equations involving Vg and Id that will yield these values. I found that after setting up the equations and solving them that the predictions matched experimental results to within 0.03V. It seems as though the devices in this lab have been quite well characterized.

  You can set up three equations and 3 unknowns.  You know the current through each transistor, and the 60k resistor is identical.  That current , I, is one of the unknowns.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The current in each transistor can be written in terms of u, C W and L, and Vth, with only Vgs unknown.  The Vgs and Vsg are the two other unknowns.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Finally, you know the voltage drop . Vgs + Vsg + IR =10V.  These give you enough equations to find the three values.
