  Late Homework Policy:
 </heading>
 <paragraph>
  Late assignments will be accepted for 3 days following the original submission deadline. A 5% grade reduction on the assignment will be imposed for each day late.

  For missed lectures, the best approach is to ask another student if you can copy their notes and then come to office hours if you have questions. Everything I cover in class is included in either of the two textbooks (with most content being derived from the Razavi book which is the required textbook for the class). If you do not have access to the "recommended" Pierret book, you can find it in the library. (I have placed it on reserve for this course. You can find the details for that on Canvas -&gt; Library Reserves.)

  Finally, if you don't mind, can you post this info to the Ed Discussion board? I assume other students may have similar questions and will find this useful.
