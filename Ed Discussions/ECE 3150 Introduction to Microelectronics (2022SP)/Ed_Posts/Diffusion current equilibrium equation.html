  Im a little confused on the middle paragraph of the image below. The book states that in the case where e- flow from n to p and holes flow from p to n, the RHS of the equation is 0. However, these diffusion currents seem to be in the same direction and are thus additive, making the RHS nonzero. Should I be ignoring the conventional current directions here? Thanks!

  so basically there are two currents produced: drift and diffusion. diffusion takes place from an unbalanced difference between the number of free holes and electrons on each side. Drift is caused by an electric field applied on the system either attracting or repulsing electrons. The large paragraph can be explained with this hypothetical scenario. say there is an electric field drawing electrons to the right, but an uneven level of free carriers is transferring electrons left. This would mean that there would be opposing currents. If the opposing currents are equal then equilibrium is occurring.  This idea leads to equation 2.62 and 2.63.
