 Hi, I was just wondering, would it be possible to post the lecture notes from OneNote onto Canvas? Sometimes it's a bit hard to take notes in class, so it'd be helpful to be able to use that to fill in gaps afterwards

  It may be best to use the zoom recordings to catch anything you may have missed during the live lecture.
