 I'm a bit confused about what gm to use for the intrinsic/extrinsic bandwidth calculations, since it seems like the ALD1105 has two nmos and two pmos transistors, so I'm not sure whether to use the gm for the nmos or the pmos transistor. Am I missing something here?

  It should be the g
  <sub>
   m
  </sub>
  of the nmos, as that's the one that the input sees (as well as being the only g
  <sub>
   m
  </sub>
  you calculated from the previous part)
