 Part c says to go back and readjust the power allocation to get appropriate values of R_D and I_D. But isn't the total power dissipated by Vdd equal to P = I*V where P=2 mW and V = 1.8V? So shouldn't I_d be fixed to 1.11mA?

  Similarly, by KCL, shouldn't the current flowing through the two branches be equal?

  You are readjusting the power allocation, which can change the specific current. You are correct that a total of 1.11mA will be coming from the source, but how will it be divided among the two paths? KCL doesn't apply here - you are comparing the R

  and R

  paths
