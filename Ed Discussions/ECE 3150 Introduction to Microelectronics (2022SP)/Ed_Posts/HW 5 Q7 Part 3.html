 This question asks us to evaluate the gms and ros and to verify that we have the 'right' gain. My notes from 4/1 lecture say that if the transistors are matched correctly, then the gain should be about half. However, I'm getting a gain of about 4600. Are my gm and ro calculations way off, or are the transistors not matched correctly?

  Hello, you are given all of the MOSFET current equation parameters, so you can directly check if the drive current level is matched between nMOS and pMOS at a given bias condition if you want. However, you don't need to check whether the MOSFETs are matched or not to answer this question. If you have the MOSFET current equation, you can extract g_m and r_o. Then get the equivalent input or output resistance to get the gain expression. You should be able to get A_v close to 300 if you calculate correctly.

   Ok, got it. I found my mistake: I miscalculated the gm's. Thanks for the clarification!
