 Is the doping level in 3b the same as 3a (10^14)?

  Hi, yes, the doping level is the same.

   Are we supposed to find a new donor doping level that yields the required drift current density?
  </p>
  <p>
   That seems to be the best way to change the electron concentration to meet the requirement.

    You found the mobility at the specific doping level in 3a. Mobility is a function of doping level, but in 3b, you may just assume that the mobility does not change with the doping level and find a new doping level that satisfies the current density requirement, using the mobility from 3a.
