  Going through the homework and my notes/Textbook. I noticed that the exponential in the hw has kb/q in the denominator, but in the textbook it just has the Boltzmann constant k in the denominator in the exponential. I was wondering if these two equations are supposed to be the same or if they do tell us something different

  In the textbook, Eg needs to be converted in to units of J so technically it would be Eg x q (1 eV = 1.6E-19 J) in the numerator. This would make the two equations equal.

  Hi, I would say both expressions are correct. The Boltzmann constant has two versions depending on the units. In the HW,
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  k_b=1.38\cdot10^{-23}\ \left[\frac{J}{K}\right]
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  In the textbook,
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  k_b=8.62\cdot10^{-5}\ \left[\frac{eV}{K}\right]
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  You need to use the one that makes the term inside the exponential unitless.
