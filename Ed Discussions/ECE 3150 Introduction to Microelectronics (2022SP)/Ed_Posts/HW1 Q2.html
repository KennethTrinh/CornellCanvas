 Going through the homework and my notes/Textbook. I noticed that the exponential in the hw has kb/q in the denominator, but in the textbook it just has the Boltzmann constant k in the denominator in the exponential. I was wondering if these two equations are supposed to be the same or if they do tell us something different

  Hi, I would say both expressions are correct. The Boltzmann constant has two versions depending on the units. In the HW,
 </p>
 <math>
  k_b=1.38\cdot10^{-23}\ \left[\frac{J}{K}\right]
 </math>
 <p>
  In the textbook,
 </p>
 <math>
  k_b=8.62\cdot10^{-5}\ \left[\frac{eV}{K}\right]
 </math>
 <p>
  You need to use the one that makes the term inside the exponential unitless.

   In the textbook, Eg needs to be converted in to units of J so technically it would be Eg x q (1 eV = 1.6E-19 J) in the numerator. This would make the two equations equal.
