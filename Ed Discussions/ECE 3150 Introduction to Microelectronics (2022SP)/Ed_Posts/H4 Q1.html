  Hi all, just a quick question: when looking at this from just the equations (which it seems to hint at from the operating regime), the W/L term seems inseparable, so how should we calculate the width and length terms separately? Should we instead calculate how the W/L term changes? Alternatively, should we be taking an overall view at MOSFET construction, and how the physical dimensions might change? Thanks!

  In an individual transistor. W/L is fixed.  But in Q1 you are asked to design a new transistor, M_eq, which will behave like the two series connected, and you have total control of W/L in the new transistor.  You will need to specify it in terms of the W/L for the M_1 and M )2 transistors.  In other wiords, you might say "keep L the same and double W", or "double L and increase W by 72" or whatever you decide, but state your new dimensions in terms of those given W and L.
