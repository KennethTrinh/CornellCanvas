  I saw that on the equation sheet we have p = ni^2 / Nd, but I thought ni^2 = np so does that mean that n always equals Nd?

  The equation ni^2 = np is true for Intrinsic semiconductor like Silicon, where charge neutrality states that due to each free electron, there is one hole that is left behind. Now, if Silicon is doped with an Donor Atom (lets say, from Group 5), then the no of donor atoms go up. If the concentration of the donor atoms (Nd) is a lot more than the equilibrium electron concentration of Silicon (n), i.e., Nd&gt;&gt;n, then in the equation, we replace n by Nd to find the concentration of holes, i.e., p=ni^2/Nd.
