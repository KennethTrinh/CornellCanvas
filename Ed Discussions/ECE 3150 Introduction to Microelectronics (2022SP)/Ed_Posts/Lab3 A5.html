  The wording for A5 seemed to be quite confusing for many people. I have updated it on Canvas and am pasting the revised wording below. I hope it is more clear.

   A.5

  Write the theoretical expression for the resistance looking into the drain-gate tie of the diode-connected nmos. Plot the IV curve of the drain current versus gate (and drain) voltage. From the measured IV curve of the nmos diode connected transistor, compute the measured dynamic resistance (

  , the small signal resistance looking into the drain-gate tie).

 <math>
  \left(\frac{\partial I_D}{\partial V_{DS}}\right)^{-1}
 </math>

  Compare the value measured at 1 mA with the theoretical calculation based on the expression you derived and the experimental parameters you calculated for the nmos in parts A.1 and A.4 above. How well do they agree?
