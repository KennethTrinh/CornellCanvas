 here it says the doping N_d is 10^14. From question 2a) we found that at 300K, the silicon free electron density was to the power of 10. Is this sufficiently large enough to assume n = N_d and p = N_d/ni^2. Also for GaS, if we were to make a similar assumption, how we would find the ni^2 for GaS since we don't have any info provided on that.

  Hi, it's always a good idea to check if n = N_d is true using the charge neutrality equation (
  <a href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/18945/discussion/1046444">
   here
  </a>
  ).

  You don't need to know about the n_i of GaAs to solve Question 3b). You want to check the equations (2.13) - (2.20) of the textbook, Fundamentals of Microelectronics by Prof. Razavi.

   Why wouldn't you need to know the n_i of GaAs? Equation 2.20 says:
  </p>
  <math>
   J_{tot}=q\left(\mu_nn+\mu_pp\right)E
  </math>
  <p>
   Wouldn't you need n_i of GaAs to find n and p?

    Hi, the plots for the question 3 has been changed. I remember the y-axis was not mobility but something else. I think I can answer your question if I have the former version. For now, the intrinsic carrier concentrations are provided and you can use them to get the electron and hole concentrations to calculate the drift current equation. If you saved the former plot, please let me know.
   </p>
