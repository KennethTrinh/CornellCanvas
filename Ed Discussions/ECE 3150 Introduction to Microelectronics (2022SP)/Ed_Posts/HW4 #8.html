 I wanted to clarify somethings. In the equation they give us it is saying it is a function of V_d correct? Is the reason its V_d and not V_ds because it's implied the source is tied to ground?  I guess I want to make sure there isn't a specific reason it was explicitly said to be a function of Vd

  You don't have to worry about that. Usually, $V_D$ represents the voltage at the Drain with respect to GND. Drain current, $I_D$, is really a function of $V_{GS}$ and/or $V_{DS}$—which can be used to find expressions for $g_m$ and $\frac{1}{r_o}$ respectively—by taking the partial derivatives of $I_D$.

   If gm = dVDS/dID and ro = dID/dVDS, can you just say that their product is 1?

    I was using this formula for gm, so my product was not simplifying to 1. The question wants us to comment on how gm*ro varies with drain current though, and the expression I get doesn't contain ID because I differentiated it with respect to VGS or VDS... So I am also confused a bit by this question.

     It should not simplify to 1. Make sure for gm you take the partial derivative of I_D with respect to V_GS and for ro with respect to V_DS (then invert that result). You can then see a change in I_D corresponds to a change in V_D, since we are given I_D is a function of V_D, and how that affects the gmro product
