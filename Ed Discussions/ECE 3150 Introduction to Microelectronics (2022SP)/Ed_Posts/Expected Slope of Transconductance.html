 I found the measured value of the slope of the transconductance at small current values, but am unsure by what is meant by the expected value; no such chart is provided on the spec sheet.

  It might be helpful to think about what value the inverse of the slope is. In other words, if you took the definition for
 </p>
 <math>
  g_m\sim\frac{I_C}{V_T}
 </math>
 <p>
  and instead evaluated 1/slope of g_m vs. Ic, does that give you a familiar number?
 </p>
 <math>
  \left(\frac{dg_m}{dI_C}\right)^{-1}=?
 </math>

   Recall how we compute the transconductance for our small-signal model. Based on that, and knowing that you are plotting transconductance versus collector current, what does the formula tell you that your slope should be?
