 How do we get expected values for these voltages if we don't know r_o (r_o is something that we calculate using the measured voltages, so it doesn't make sense to use it to calculate expected voltages?)

  Look at the last page of the lab handout, it lists r_0 for the nmos and pmos transistors, as well as the g_m

   But these are dependent on V_gs and V_ds, which we can't know until we calculate the expected voltage? (obviously we could use the measured V_gs and V_ds, but then what would be the point of calculating the expected voltage?)

    You should calculate the expected Vgs and Vsg voltages from matching the currents in that left branch through Rref. (Problem A1 describes what to do.) Ignore channel length modulation for this prediction.

    Separately,  use the measured voltages to get the ro values from the graph.
