  Hi, Professor El-Ghazaly explained how to generate the energy band diagram from the charge profile. Please look at the attached image. Because of the exposed charge in the depletion region of the pn junction, there exists non-zero charge in the middle. When you know the doping concentrations in the n- and p-sides, and if you assume the doping is uniform in each side, you know about the charge profile as shown in (b). If you know the charge profile, you can generate the electric field profile using the Poisson equation as we learned in class (Fig. (c)). The area under the electric field vs distance plot (Fig. (c)) corresponds to the built-in potential. The area is equal to the built-in potential. You have the built-in potential equation. From the Poisson equation you get the maximum electric field ε_0. In the third equation, the depletion region width, W, can be derived. The depletion capacitance (per area) is equal to the dielectric constant of silicon over the depletion region width.

  V_{bi}=\frac{k_BT}{q}\ln\left(\frac{N_AN_D}{n_i^2}\right)
 </math>
 <math>
  \varepsilon_0=-\frac{q}{\epsilon}N_Dx_{no}=-\frac{q}{\epsilon}N_Ax_{po}
 </math>
 <math>
  AREA=V_{bi}=\frac{1}{2}\cdot\left(x_{no}+x_{po}\right)\cdot\left|\varepsilon_0\right|=\frac{1}{2}\cdot W\cdot\left|\varepsilon_0\right|
 </math>
 <math>
  C_{dep}=\frac{\epsilon_0\epsilon_s}{W}\left[\frac{F}{cm^2}\right]
