 Can we please have the equation sheet that will be included with the final so that we don't put those equations on our notes sheet?

  I have not yet made the equation sheet. However, you can be sure it will be the same format as the midterm exam. I don't explain what each equation refers to, I just give the equations as a list. So, make sure you are familiar with the relevant equations so that you can use the sheet only as a reference, when needed.
