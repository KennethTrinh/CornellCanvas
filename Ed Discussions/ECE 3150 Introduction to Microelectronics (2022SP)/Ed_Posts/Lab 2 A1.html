 In the datasheet, there are 2 vce sats listed. How do I know which one? I tried to look at the SMU setting but I'm still confused.

 I just ended up using the one closest to my data.

  One is given for I_c = 10 mA, and the other was for 50 mA. The saturation voltage is weakly dependent on the base and collector currents.   In Lab 2 the traces you took were a max of 5 mA, so you probably saw something slightly greater than what is listed in the datasheets.  My data looked closer to 0.4 V.  I attributed it to the smaller Ic and Ib compared to what is listed in the datasheet.
