 Where does the operating point for a transistor in
 <b>
  cutoff
 </b>
 go? When base current is 0, there isn't a single point where it could be. It seems like it could be the whole line.

  Use what you learned in 2100.  Apply KVL.  The voltage on the collector is simply Vcc - I R.  If I=0, the collector voltage must be Vcc.

   Remember the graphs x axis is Vce. Look at that figure and the circuit again. you are correct the base current is zero in cutoff.
