  I don't understand how they just decided B&gt;&gt;1 when calculating gain on page 203. Are we allowed to randomly make this assumption when we are not given a B and it makes our calculation easier?

  Hello, this is a very reasonable assumption since the current gain is usually ~100 which is 2 orders of magnitude larger than 1 when the transistor is operating in the active region. You can use this assumption if it makes your calculations simpler, for ex, when calculating the voltage gain.

  Recall the definition of r_pi
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  r_{\pi}=\frac{\beta}{g_m}
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  You can see that g_m is beta times larger than 1/r_pi, so if beta is even 20, this is a reasonable approximation.
