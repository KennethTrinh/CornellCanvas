 I don't understand how they just decided B&gt;&gt;1 when calculating gain on page 203. Are we allowed to randomly make this assumption when we are not given a B and it makes our calculation easier?

  Recall the definition of r_pi
 </p>
 <math>
  r_{\pi}=\frac{\beta}{g_m}
 </math>
 <p>
  You can see that g_m is beta times larger than 1/r_pi, so if beta is even 20, this is a reasonable approximation.

   Hello, this is a very reasonable assumption since the current gain is usually ~100 which is 2 orders of magnitude larger than 1 when the transistor is operating in the active region. You can use this assumption if it makes your calculations simpler, for ex, when calculating the voltage gain.
