  I am a bit confused about k_p here.  Assuming we find the slope of the fitted line on the graph, that slope would have units S/V, but k_p on the lab template has units of V.  I would assume k_p is found by performing some type of arithmetic on this slope, but I'm not sure what values of g_m I would use.

  That's a typo. Yes, it should have units of S/V; thanks for pointing this out.
