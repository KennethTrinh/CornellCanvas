 When it says to "Comment on the differences between the npn and pnp devices", does that mean we should also create a graph for the pnp BJT and compare the npn and pnp graphs?

  We just want a qualitative comparison. Since we didn't make a place for the pnp graph in the template, no need to add the plot. Just graph it for yourself and qualitatively look at the different beta trends. Write down any obvious differences you see between the npn and pnp versions.
