  I had a couple questions about the picture above.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1) Why does adding a voltage source increase the number of positive and negative ions? Intuitively, it made sense that adding a voltage source would enhance the existing E-field, meaning it would be harder for current to drift or diffuse. But doesn't the existence of more ions indicate more electrons or holes diffusing to the other region.

  2) during the section that follows this picture, it mentions how V_r is negative. Why is this the case.  The picture below includes an instance where it says that

  1) Does the picture above mean, the E-field increases, but the capacitance (due to expanding distance decrease?

  1) Under forward bias (i.e. positive voltage applied to p-type region with respect to n-type region), the carriers on either side of the junction will have a greater tendency to move into the depletion region. This results in recombination near the borders of the depletion region and the corresponding carrier region, which reduces the effective width of the depletion region.

  2) The negative seems to be in reference to the fact that the figure shows a reverse bias scenario.
