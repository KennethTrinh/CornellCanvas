 I'm having a bit of a hard time trying to find the output resistance for this particular circuit. Anything that I do leads to either circular or overly complex equations. More specifically, I am having a hard time pulling out v_pi out of the equations. This was the small signal circuit that I had and the equations I started with.

  Hello, I believe you forgot to include R_c in your circuit. Let me answer how to remove v_π by assuming that your circuit is correct. You need to use KVL to get the equation that relates v_π with v_x.
 </p>
 <math>
  v_x=v_{\pi}+i_xR_{BC}
 </math>
