 Could I get a hint on how to find Vce in question 2 of the HW? I think I am able to find Vbe for all three examples, but since examples i and ii have the collector hooked up to a current source, I'm not sure how I should go about finding Vce.

  Given the base current, $I_B$, and the collector current, $I_C$, you can identify the point at which each circuit is operating from the graph provided. Note that $V_{CE}$ is simply the value on the x-axis.

   Using I_B and I_C allows us to identify the line which describes the BJT behavior. However, in part 2c, we are also asked to estimate V_CE. How should we go from the range of values shown in the graph to a specific value of V_CE?

    You only need $I_B$ to select the appropriate curve. $I_C$ is the y-coordinate of the point on that curve. If you are referring to the forward active region specifically (approximately horizontal portion), there is a small slope due to the early effect. Again this is just an approximation based on the graph provided, but if your circuit indicates that it is in forward active mode, that should be consistent with your choice of $V_{CE}$. Also be aware that there are other modes of operation, which correspond to different parts of the curve.
