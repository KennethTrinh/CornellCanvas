 Just want to clarify that "0.5% of your devices will be different from your specs" means that each individual transistor in each sense amp has a .5% probability of being asymetric.

  Yes, this can be interpreted as each transistor has a 0.5% chance of failing, therefore there is a 99.5% chance that it does not fail. This can be worked into finding out the probability of the overall amplifier as a whole failing.
