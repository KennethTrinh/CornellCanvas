  I'm not sure where the B+1 in the denominator comes from in this equation for Rout of the common collector with a source resistance. I tried drawing the small signal model and deriving Rout myself and got the same equation except I got Rs/B instead of Rs/(B+1).

  Similarly for this question from the PollEv where we find the gain of this amplifier and the correct answer was the last choice. I also tried to derive it from the small signal model and got Rb/B in the denominator rather than Rb/(B+1).

  Yes, you're exactly right. When you evaluate the small signal and determine the expression analytically, you get R_B/beta. Then the book just tries to make it look a bit more intuitive by saying R_B/(beta+1) since the 1 doesn't matter when beta &gt;&gt;1.
