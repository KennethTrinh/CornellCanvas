  I wanted to double check units for number 4. Using the Jtot formula, I got A/cm*microm. If i integrate Jtot with bounds that are in cm and microm, I assume I do not need to do any unit conversions. Is that correct? Also, does it make sense if my current is negative?

  Yes the unit conversion is correct. Since I is given by area integration of J, the area units cancel out. Negative current direction simply means the current is in opposite direction to your initial assumption.
