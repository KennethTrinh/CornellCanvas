  I don't think I understand cutoff. I see there is no base current, but why is there no collector current? I saw #97, but still don't get it.

  The easiest way to explain this would be to look at the relation given in lecture: Ic=Beta*Ib. since Ib is zero so is Ic. If you would like a more conceptual explanation, the transistor can be seen as a switch. In cutoff, the transistor can be viewed as an open circuit from collector to emitter. Current cannot flow across an open circuit so Ic is zero.

  That is a good explanation.  Another perspective is that the transistor can be used as a switch.  All computers use transistors as switches, not amplifiers.  A switch can be on or off.  When there is no base current, the transsitor is off. In a computer, to turn the transistor on to "close the switch", the base is driven with a large current that makes the Collector go into the saturation mode, and V_ce drops to nearly zero volts, almost as good as flipping a switch closed.
