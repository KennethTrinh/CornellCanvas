 From equation 2.92, we are able to see that Pn,f is greater than Pn,e. However, I am struggling to understanding the sentence underneath eq. 2.92 that states that "the minority carrier concentration on the p side rises rapidly with the forward bias voltage". At the moment, I am unable to see a connection between Pn,f &gt; Pn,e and the aforementioned sentence since the former relation deals with the n-side while the latter sentence deals with the p-side.
</p>
<p>
 Thanks in advance.

  Hello,
 </p>
 <p>
  You may get confused with the notation. The subscript indicates the type of semiconductor, n- or p-type.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pn: hole concentration in n-type semiconductor [cm^-3] (minority carrier)
 </p>
 <p>
  Pp: hole concentration in p-type semiconductor [cm^-3] (majority carrier)
 </p>
 <p>
  Nn: electron concentration in n-type semiconductor [cm^-3] (majority carrier)
 </p>
 <p>
  Np: electron concentration in p-type semiconductor [cm^-3] (minority carrier)
 </p>
 <p>
  Pn,f &gt; Pn,e means the minority hole concentration in n-type semiconductor in forward bias is larger than that in equilibrium.

   Noted. However, the text states: "In other words, the minority carrier concentration on the
   <b>
    p side
   </b>
   rises rapidly with the forward bias voltage while the majority carrier concentration remains relatively constant."

    Oh I see what you mean. I think that's a typo. The same thing happens to the p-side as well, but the previous sentence (Pn,f &gt; Pn,e) talks about the n-side, so I believe the following sentence is better.
   </p>
   <p>
    "In other words, the minority carrier concentration on the
    <b>
     n-side
    </b>
    rises rapidly with the forward bias voltage while the majority carrier concentration remains relatively constant."

   Hello, looks like Professor El-Ghazaly answered this after lecture today. In the future if you post questions directly referencing specific equations or lines from the textbook, can you include a picture of the specific part you are asking about (if possible)? This will help students who may not have the textbook in front of them at the time and will also help us to answer questions more quickly. Thanks.
  </p>
