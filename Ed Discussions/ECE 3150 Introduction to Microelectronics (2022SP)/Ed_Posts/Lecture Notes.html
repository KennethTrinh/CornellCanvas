 Would it be possible for the lecture notes to be posted on Canvas for us to use as a reference?

 Thanks

  Unfortunately, my policy is that I don't share my notes. I truly believe students learn better by writing down the material themselves and thinking through it in the process. Please feel free to use the zoom recordings on Canvas to find anything that you may have missed during the live lecture. Once we switch back to in-person next week, note-taking will hopefully be easier since I will be writing on the blackboard at the same pace as all of you.
