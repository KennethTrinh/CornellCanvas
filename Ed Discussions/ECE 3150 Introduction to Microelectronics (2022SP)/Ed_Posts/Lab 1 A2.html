 What does it mean when it says "Adjust your measured amplitude data of the output signal (channel 2) with a decibel offset at each frequency such that the amplitude of the fundamental is at zero decibels. Adjust your measured amplitude data of the input signal (channel 1) such that the noise floor of each input and output signal is the same (at roughly -60 dBs)."? What is the fundamental?

  The fundamental is your fundamental frequency (i.e. 250Hz). You should scale your data so that the height of the peak at the fundamental is at 0dB.

  For noise floor, see #91.
