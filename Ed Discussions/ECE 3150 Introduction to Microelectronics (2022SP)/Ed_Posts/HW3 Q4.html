  I'm confused on this question and how it treats voltages and energies.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Part (b) says that the semiconductor work function is an energy equal to (chi_x + E_g / 2 + phi_F). But phi_f has units of voltage while chi_x and E_g / 2 have units of energy.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Then on part (e), it says Vf = phi_m - phi_s. How can this be the case if Vf has units of voltage and the problem states that phi_m and phi_s have units of energy?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Am I correct in assuming that everything should just be a voltage and not eV?
 </paragraph>

  Hello, technically work function should be =(q*chi_x + E_g / 2 + q*phi_F), however you can just see that the units of chi_x are also given in eV, which means it has been converted to eV,. Similarly, for part (f), phi_m and phi_s technically should have units of voltage, but they could be also expressed as eV, which means the 'q' term has bene absorbed into them.
