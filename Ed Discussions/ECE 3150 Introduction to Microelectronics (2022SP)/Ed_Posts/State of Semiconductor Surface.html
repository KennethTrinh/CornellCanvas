 How can we know the state of a semi conductor surface when the materials are brought into contact solely based on the energy diagram? For instance, in the question attached, how did we know the answer was depletion and not any of the other options?

  You have to look at how the Fermi levels will shift. When they are brought into contact, there is no bias, so the Fermi levels must be constant across. The Fermi level of the metal will not change, so E
  <sub>
   f
  </sub>
  will need to rise to be at the appropriate level. E
  <sub>
   v
  </sub>
  and E
  <sub>
   c
  </sub>
  will shift with E
  <sub>
   f
  </sub>

   except at the contact surface
  </b>
  , where they will remain constant relative to the oxide. This will cause the bands to bend up as they go away from the surface, resulting in a depletion state.

   To add, we know it won't go past depletion in this case, because the Fermi level at the surface (where it rose to) would have to be above the intrinsic level E
   <sub>
    i
   </sub>
   the same amount that it is below E
   <sub>
    i
   </sub>
   far away from the surface. Since E
   <sub>
    i
   </sub>
   is halfway, and we can estimate E
   <sub>
    f
   </sub>
   for the metal to be about halfway (E
   <sub>
    i
   </sub>
   ), E
   <sub>
    f
   </sub>
   for the semiconductor can't raise far enough to get to the point of threshold (not to even consider that the oxide would bend as well)
