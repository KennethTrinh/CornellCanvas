  This graph was drawn above when considering the intersection of the P and N junction. Why does the energy levels for the p region have to be higher than that for the n? Also, is there an intuitive reason for which the fermi levels must be the same between them?

  Actually I figure out part of it from looking at lecture notes closer. Its because there is a potential difference across the junction so the potential energy must rise right? However It is still not clear to me why the fermi levels must be the same.

  Fermi Levels must be equal for equilibrium to occur.

  if you think of a p-type semiconductor and an n-type semiconductor separately, they resemble this

  you are correct that the potential is different in each side. Note that the fermi levels are also different. When the sides are brought together, diffusion of holes from the p region and electrons from the n region occurs and the fermi levels equal out. The transfer of free carriers on each side leaves uncompensated ions which also creates the depletion region discussed in lecture. Picture below. Note the p-side and n-side are flipped from the image above to the one below.

  I hope this helps. Feel free to ask more questions if you need more clarification.
