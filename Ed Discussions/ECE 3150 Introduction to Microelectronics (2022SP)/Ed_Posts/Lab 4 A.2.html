  How do I calculate RL as a changing value to graph based on. I remembers switching RL out during the lab, but I do not understand why we would graph the log of a constant value.

  Hello, the question A.2. provides the equation that relates A_v,ce with R_L. You can extract the small signal parameters like β or r_π from Fig. 1, and then you can plot A_v,ce as a function of R_L. The only reason you want to plot in semi-log scale is that the data points are not easily seen in linear scale. You have three data points at 1, 10, and 1000 kΩ (no load). If you plot them in linear scale, the points at 1 and 10 kΩ cannot be seen because 1000 kΩ is too large.
