 For weeks where we don't have lab, will they be turned into office hours? Do we still have to show up for anything?

  You only have to come to your specific lab section time on those 5 weeks that are noted in the syllabus (calendar on the last couple pages). On other weeks, you don't have to do anything during that time block! The office hour times will remain the same each week (also specified in the syllabus). We won't be converting lab time into OH time.
