 How would one find the required Ic? Is the 75 ohm input impedance just the input impedance of the CB stage? The input impedance term I have for both the stages 'together' has RC2 term in it, thus, making the calculation cyclic.

 Thanks!

  The calculation is not cyclic. You can find I
  <sub>
   C
  </sub>
  in terms of R
  <sub>
   C2
  </sub>
  , like you mentioned. From there, you can use your knowledge of a self-biased transistor (see #135) to find an equation in terms of R
  <sub>
   B2
  </sub>
  and R
  <sub>
   C2
  </sub>
  . From here, you just need to pick values that satisfy
