  Are we expected to simplify the small signal model, or is the unsimplified model without ro acceptable?

  It is okay to draw the simplified small signal model directly. Drawing the full version with ro can be a good first step to avoid any mistakes that may come up if you try to jump right into the simplified model, especially since this circuit has two transistors and the complete small signal model has to properly combine them both. Since you are told to ignore Early Effect, you can make an assumption/generalization about what ro would be.
