 For lab1 submission, is it a requirement to use the lab1 template, or could we do it in other formats? Thank you so much in advance.

  You do not have to use the template, but the template is intended to streamline the grading process and to establish what information we would like to see from you. If you don't use the template, make sure that all information requested by the template and the lab handout are provided in your submission.

  Graphs on the template should be clear enough that any labels can be read and that the shape of any waveforms are identifiable. If we are able to zoom in on what you submit, we will as needed.

   Just one follow-up question: if we are going to use the template, will you zoom in on the graph while grading? Or do we have to provide a zoomed-in version? Thanks.
