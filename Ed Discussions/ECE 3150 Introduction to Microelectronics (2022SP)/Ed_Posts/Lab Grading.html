 When can we expect to get lab grades back? I am just hoping I am not repeating any dumb mistakes for the past three labs....

  Unfortunately we were a bit delayed with getting the lab solutions but we should be getting at least the first lab out soon. I can comment so far on the biggest mistake I have seen personally and other TAs can feel free to comment if they have seen other general mistakes too.
 </p>
 <p>
  What I see being done wrong most is in comment sections, when someone is asked to explain or compare something. Many students are comparing say nmos or pmos in general rather than specifically discussing the comparison within the range of that section/question (want graph observations or value comparisons).
 </p>
 <p>
  Also, Some students are not reading the questions carefully and missing some parts, for example, not placing spec sheet values on a graph when asked to.
 </p>

  Hope this helps!
