 I am working on 9a but am also asking in general. When I have googled around, most sites talk about how your batteries would explode. One website talked about how the smaller value source acts like a short. The latter makes sense to me, but I wanted to confirm.

 Thanks!

  If you have two ideal voltage sources of the same value in parallel, it's effectively the same as having just one source of the same value; any current drawn would be evenly distributed between the sources.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the case where the sources are different values, current will flow from the higher voltage to the lower voltage. It's similar to shorting a voltage source in that you are shorting two nodes of different voltages together (as would be the case if you were to add a short across a single voltage source). For things like batteries, this usually means you'll have wasted energy. In a more extreme case, it can cause a failure in the lower voltage battery if the voltage difference is large enough.
