  I am working on 9a but am also asking in general. When I have googled around, most sites talk about how your batteries would explode. One website talked about how the smaller value source acts like a short. The latter makes sense to me, but I wanted to confirm.

  If you have two ideal voltage sources of the same value in parallel, it's effectively the same as having just one source of the same value; any current drawn would be evenly distributed between the sources.

  In the case where the sources are different values, current will flow from the higher voltage to the lower voltage. It's similar to shorting a voltage source in that you are shorting two nodes of different voltages together (as would be the case if you were to add a short across a single voltage source). For things like batteries, this usually means you'll have wasted energy. In a more extreme case, it can cause a failure in the lower voltage battery if the voltage difference is large enough.
