  Can you clarify what 'non-thermal equilibrium' means? Is equilibrium happening but it is a different type than thermal? Or is there no kind of equilibrium happening (so the drift and diffusion currents aren't equal)?

  I think it’s so that we don’t use Einstein’s relations (Jdiff=Jdrift)

  Hi, I don't think you need to pay too much attention to 'thermal.' In Q4, it is assume that electron and hole is being injected from both ends of the pn junction, so the carrier concentration does not change over time. On the other hand, if you inject a finite amount of hole/electrons (no continuous injection), as they diffuse to the other side, the concentration decreases. I think 'non-thermal equilibrium' here means steady-state. The injection of carriers breaks the equilibrium, but it maintains the steady-state carrier concentrations. (no change over time)
