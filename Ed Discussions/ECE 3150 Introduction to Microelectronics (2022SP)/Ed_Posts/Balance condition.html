  Hi, N_a is Group 3, and B is one of the typical acceptors to Si. When you put B in a silicon crystal, B get ionized; it provides one hole (= takes one electron). As a result, the B atom becomes negatively charged. B is neutral when there are 3 valence atoms, but now it has 4 electrons and becomes negatively charged. The same thing happens to the donor.
