  When finding the predicted currents for this question, are we supposed to find them using the emitter degeneration equation?

  When I tried this I ended up getting an I_c value that would've caused my V_c to become negative

  Hello, I don't see V_P in Fig. 3 in the Lab A.1. Where did you get it? For the predictions, first you make a guess to choose I_B, and then determine I_C and I_E from β. You can extract β from the figure 1 right?
