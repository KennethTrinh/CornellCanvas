  The question says "How well matched are these NMOS and PMOS devices?". Does this mean we have to compare it to spec sheet values?

  From my understanding, you are comparing the parameters between the nmos and pmos - you would expect the values to be about negative of one another, how much is that true? Could be wrong though

  Yes, this is a fairly general question since you only looked at two devices, so you can't get into much detailed comparison of parameters.  Just note that the two devices both show gain, but operate i complementary fashion with respect to I and V.
