  I'm confused about this line in A3: "Make an estimate describing the relative amplitudes of the first three harmonics (250, 500, 750)". It makes sense to compute the relative amplitudes of 500, 750, and 1000 relative to 250, but if we are computing the relative amplitude of 250, what is it relative to?

  These magnitudes are relative to 0dB (unity gain). Your data should be scaled in such a way that the noise floor sits at around -60dB. See #90.

  We were also instructed to scale the data such that the fundamental frequency was at 0dB, which kind of made me think that we were just comparing the other frequencies to 250 Hz, hence my confusion.

  Apologies, here is my comment from that post (which I now see is private):

  "If you plot the data, you will see that the amplitude of noise has an apparent upper bound across the whole frequency spectrum; we call this the noise floor. See if you can identify the magnitude of this noise floor, then scale your data (y-axis) so that this noise floor sits at around -60dB."
