 How do I create a valid small-signal model when there is no small signal input?
</p>
<p>
 Everything is connected to AC ground, so the result is nonsense?

  You can just treat $V_{GS}$ as your "input signal". There isn't an explicit input drawn in these circuit diagrams, so you can imagine that some small signal input would be applied across $V_{GS}$.
