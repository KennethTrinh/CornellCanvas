  To find my collector-emitter saturation voltage, I took the line that I created for determining the Early voltage (slope and intercept from the flat part of the I_C vs. V_CE graph) and then picked the first voltage where the measured I_C is within 1% of what is predicted by the line.

  I did that b/c I figured that that's where the line starts to flatten out, so that would be the saturation voltage. However, the value that I got by doing this (0.45 V) did not match the datasheet for the 2N3904 transistor (0.20 V). What did I do wrong?

  It is a subjective call, and your process is fine.  1% is probably a tighter tolerance that the manufacturer used, so the difference is due to how each of you defined when saturation began.  In my analysis, I also found the saturation voltage I (subjectively) decided on was larger than that listed in the data sheet.

  My pnp data was a much better match.

  There is no "wrong" answer when you can support a claim based on your data.

  I recommend just inspecting by eye. Temporarily change your x-axis limits to be from 0 to 0.5 V for Vce, then estimate where the curve starts to flatten. Call that Vce_sat. Mine matched pretty closely to the datasheet value.
