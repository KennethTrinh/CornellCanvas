 I'm reviewing the textbook chapter that talks about drift &amp; diffusion currents, and I was wondering: I understand that diffusion current occurs because there is an imbalance in the concentration of charge carriers, but since the charger carriers themselves create an electric field, is their movement really different from the movement that causes drift current? (the charger carriers are still moving around according to the electric field)

  Diffusion and drift are completely different.  There probably is some microscopic electric field created by the diffusion of carriers, but the driving force to the motion is simply random scattering, and not an internal field.  In a 1 D case, let's say a carrier has equal probability to scatter to the left or the right. and there are 100 carriers to the right, and 10 carriers to the left.  Of the 100 on the right, 50 scatter to the left. Of the 10 carriers to the right, 5 scatter to the left.  The net effect is that 45 carriers have moved to the right. That is diffusion. This random scattering will keep on pushing carriers into the less dense region until an equilibrium is reached where the random scattering to the left and right is equalized.  There is no electric field contribution.

  The presence of an E field moves the entire distribution in the direction (or against it depending on the polarity) along the field.  There is no randomness in this process.
