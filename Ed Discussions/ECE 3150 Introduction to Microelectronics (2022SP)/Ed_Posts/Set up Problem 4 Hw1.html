 Normally

<math>
 I\ =\ \int_{ }^{ }JdA
</math>
<p>
 Where J is the current going through an area, but in this problem J depends on x, so does that mean that the area of our semiconductor is the height-width one, and that the total current is the sum of the JA at all points on the x axis between 0 and 1.5?

   I think that I = JA where A is the height-width cross-sectional area. I don't think J depends on x, since the p and n concentrations are linear (the graph that is given to us), so the derivative is just the slope. I could be wrong though
