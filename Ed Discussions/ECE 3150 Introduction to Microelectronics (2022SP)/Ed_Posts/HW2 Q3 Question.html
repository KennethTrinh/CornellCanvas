 For forward active regime it is true that:
</p>
<p>
 Vc &gt; Vb and Vb &gt; Ve.
</p>
<p>
 On HW2, Q3, it says that Vbe = 0.7V, yet the Vce sat = 0.2V. I was wondering how this was possible because Ve is grounded, so Ve = 0. Then since Vbe = 0.7V and Ve = 0V, Vb = 0.7V. So, to be in forward active Vc &gt; Vb, so Vc &gt; 0.7V must be true.
</p>
<p>
 But, the problem says Vce sat = 0.2V and since Ve = 0V, Vc &gt; 0.2V must be true. Again, given the conditions of forward active, I thought Vc &gt; 0.7V would have to be true.
</p>
<p>
 How is this possible?

  V
  <sub>
   CE
  </sub>
  <sup>
   sat
  </sup>
  is a device parameter. However, V
  <sub>
   BE
  </sub>
  is where we are currently operating. At this operating point, V
  <sub>
   CE
  </sub>
  isn't equal to V
  <sub>
   CE
  </sub>
  <sup>
   sat
  </sup>
  (as you'd be right - we wouldn't be in forward active!)
 </p>
 <p>
  Going a bit further:
 </p>
 <p>
  3a) V
  <sub>
   BE
  </sub>
  is 0.7
  <b>
   for this question
  </b>
  . This would correspond to a V
  <sub>
   CE
  </sub>
  &gt;0.7V
 </p>
 <p>
  3b) Now we're trying to find the limit of being in forward active. Here, the minimum is in the case where V
  <sub>
   CE
  </sub>
  =V
  <sub>
   CE
  </sub>
  <sup>
   sat
  </sup>
  . At this operating point, V
  <sub>
   BE
  </sub>
  would have to be less than 0.2V to be in forward active
