  You may consider commenting on which values are larger/smaller (or if they are similar); this could be as simple as writing an inequality with appropriately labeled variables. For part (a.), you should make at least two such comments:

 <list style="number">
  <li>
   <p>
    Germanium/Silicon @ 300K
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Germanium/Silicon @ 600K
   </p>
  </li>
 </list>
