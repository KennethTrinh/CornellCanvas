  I'm a bit confused as to where the negative sign is coming from in eq. 2.43 (for current density of holes) on page 33 of the Razavi Textbook.

  Thanks in advance.

  My guess is, relative to 2.42, it indicates that the current from holes will be negative compared to what you'd expect for electrons, due to the switched charge

  I arrived to a similar conclusion as well. However, eq. 2.19 includes Jn and Jp yet Jn and Jp in 2.19 are not of opposite signs.

  There is an important distinction between drift and diffusion.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  When deriving equation 2.19, we start with the general relationship: Jn=-qnvdn for electrons and Jp=qpvdp for holes. In order to understand the final signs in equation 2.19 in the textbook, consider the sign of the drift velocity for each. For electrons, vdn=-unE and for holes, vdp=+upE. Therefore, when these two drift velocities are plugged into the current density equations, the negative signs for the Jn cancel out. This is why equation 2.19 has two positive terms.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Equations 2.42/2.43 are describing diffusion, which is the movement of charges due to a nonuniform charge profile in a semiconductor. For electrons, the diffusion current is in the same direction as the electron density gradient, making Jn positive. However, since the holes have opposite charge from electrons, the negative sign is carried through in equation 2.43.
