 Dear all,
</p>
<p>
 Since we are falling a little bit behind my original lecture schedule, I will be updating HW3 to keep only the BJT and MOS capacitor questions with the addition of a few BJT questions from the textbook. If you have somehow gotten ahead and already solved the MOSFET questions, hang onto your answers, because I'll just be moving those questions to HW4.
</p>
<p>
 New version of HW3 will be posted in the next hour.
</p>
<p>
 Best of luck,
</p>
<p>
 Professor El-Ghazaly

  Made one small edit to remove part b from problem 6. Now HW3 is finalized.

   Could you please send this out as an email to the class? A lot of us can't get ED to send us notifications properly.

   Thanks!
