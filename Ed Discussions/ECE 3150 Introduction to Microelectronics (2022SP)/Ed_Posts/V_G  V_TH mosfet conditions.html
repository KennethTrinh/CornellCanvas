 What is the physical reason for why we have a maximum depletion width in our semiconductor? Why does the depletion width not continue to increase as we make V_G above V_TH?

  Inversion is the region you are talking about, where the Vg is greater than the Vth. The depletion region reaches a maximum size due to a maximum amount of depletion charge. At some point depletion charge will be capped, regardless of the gate voltage you are applying. In other words, if phi does not increase, neither will the depletion region width. At this point, electrons are forming the inversion layer. Previously, the depletion width w needed to increase in order to maintain charge neutrality. Once the inversion layer forms, charge neutrality is achieved via the electrons building up in the inversion layer. Now, increases in gate voltage will affect the minority carriers as opposed to increasing the depletion charge.
