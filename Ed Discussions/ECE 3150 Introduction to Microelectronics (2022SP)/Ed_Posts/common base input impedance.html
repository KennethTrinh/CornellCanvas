 Currently trying to derive the resistance looking into the common base, and I don't understand why Vy = ixRc here:

</figure>
<p>
 When I tried to do it myself using KCL, this is what I got (where Vout is the same thing as Vy):
</p>

</figure>
<p>
 I'm not quite sure what I'm doing wrong. Could someone help explain?

  You're right that Vy should not just be equal to ixRc. That was my mistake.
 </p>
 <p>
  The correct KCL would give
 </p>
 <math>
  V_y=\left(i_x+\frac{v_{\pi}}{r_{\pi}}\right)R_C
 </math>
 <p>
  I'll upload a revised derivation soon. The result should still be the same. My apologies for that mistake.

   Your approach is good, but you put the wrong sign for the current source. The current from the current source  should be +g_m  v_x.  Then solve for v_x/i_x and you should get the right answer
