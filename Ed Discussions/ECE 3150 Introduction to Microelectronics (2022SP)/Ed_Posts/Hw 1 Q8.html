 How do you approach part a)? Since this is in forward bias, do we use the approximation that I_d = I_0exp(V_d/V_t) instead of the one with the -1 in the exponential? Also would the idea be to get the individual diode voltages first since those are needed plug into the current equation for the v_d term?

  Hello, the assumption of I_d = I_0exp(V_d/V_t)  seems to be a fair assumption assuming the diodes are in forward bias.

  To approach the problem, you have 3 unknowns to find ( but really 2 unknowns since the other is dependent on 2), you can apply KVL,KCL equations to solve for them. The assumption of neglecting the -1 term should help in simplifying the expressions.  I hope this helps you to get to the answer.
