  Are we allowed to assume that the electron concentration is the doping concentration? In the book, the doping concentration is orders of magnitude higher than the intrinsic concentration so we were allowed to assume that the doping concentration was the electron concentration. However, in this case ni and n are much closer so I don't know if we're still allowed to assume the same thing. Do we need to add ni in the doping concentration?

  I'm inclined to say that we can't ignore Ni. In am example provided in the textbook, the doping was six orders of magnitude greater than Ni if I recall correctly. This isn't the case in this question.

  Hi, if you want to know the exact carrier concentration, you can start from the charge neutrality equation. I believe Professor El-Ghazaly will cover this soon. All the charge in your semiconductor adds to zero. In the Equation 1, n0 is the electron concentration in equilibrium, p0 is the hole concentration in equilibrium, Na is the acceptor (dopant with valence electron less than 4) concentration, Nd is the donor (dopant with valence electron more than 4) concentration. I will make two assumptions here. First, the donor is Group 5 and the acceptor is Group 3; one atom provides one electron or hole. Second, the dopants are fully ionized; the extra carrier concentration introduced by the dopants is equal to the dopant concentration. Each donor atom provides an electron to silicon, and then it gets positively charged. Similarly, each acceptor atom becomes negatively charged when it provides a hole (equivalent to getting one more electron). So to achieve charge neutrality, the sum of all 4 charge should go to zero (Equation 1). According to the mass action law that was covered today, ni^2 = n0*p0. Equation 4 is the electron concentration at equilibrium. If there are both donors and acceptors, the compensation doping effect (covered today) can be seen; Nd-Na. You can do the same thing for holes. According to the equation 4, if the dopant density is much larger than ni, you can ignore ni. If not, you can calculate it from the equation.

  So basically in this problem, the 5 Ã— 10^16 cm-3 of Phosphorus is the same as Nd?

  Why isn't it n0 + p0 = Na + Nd?

  You cannot relate charge like that. The only thing you can say is that the sum of all negative charge is equal to the sum of all positive to adds to zero. The negative charge concentration is n0 + Na, and the positive one is p0 + Nd.

  In most cases, Nd or Na is a few orders higher than ni, so you can just ignore ni.
