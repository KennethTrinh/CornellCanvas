 Topics up to Friday's lecture means that mosfets and mosfet amplifiers will be be covered on the midterm?

  ^ I was wondering if we needed to know how to solve circuits with MOSFETs in them

  For MOSFETs, you should be able to answer questions like you have seen on the homework 1 and 2, like MOS capacitance questions. You should also be able to identify regions of operations of a given MOSFET configuration. It would not be a bad idea to have an understanding of the semiconductor physics involved with Mosfets, which can help you to take an intuitive approach to the above mentioned questions.
