  My units aren't working out for the capacitance when I use E_s = 1.04 E -12 F/cm, I get a capacitance with units (F cm^-4 V^-1) ^1/2. But I expect the units to just be farads. I'm just plugging in the given numbers in the equation and my answer from part b, but regardless of the values, the units should work out. Is there a way to manipulate the units so they work out, or am I missing something?

  Hi, if you use the junction capacitance equation to calculate the value, you get [F/cm^2]. The typical unit of the capacitances in transistors is Farads per unit area. I think you forgot to include the unit charge q. If you include the unit charge, you will get [F/cm^2].

  Thank you, I figured it out, I forgot to multiply by q
