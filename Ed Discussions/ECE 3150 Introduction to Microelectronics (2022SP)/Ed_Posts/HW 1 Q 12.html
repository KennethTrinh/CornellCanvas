 Are there any suggestions on how to approach this question? I understand that there is a low pass filter so C &amp; R should be in series at some point in the flow. But I am not sure what the diode will do?

  In this question you have a modulated waveform from which you are trying to extract a signal. The past two lectures have focused a lot on applications of diodes as rectifiers. Reference these notes to see how you can couple the diode with the simple filter to get the desired output signal.

   So to clarify, we're allowed to use more than one diode? The questions implies that we only can use one.

    You should only need one.
