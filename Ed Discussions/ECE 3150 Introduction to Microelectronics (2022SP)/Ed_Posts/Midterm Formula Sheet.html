  My guess is that, since you're allowed a piece of paper to bring with you, a formula sheet probably won't be provided; if you want a formula, you can just write it down

  A basic equation sheet is provided. However, it is a good idea to put any and all formulas you think you might need on your note sheet.

  We will not provide the equation sheet in advance - it is meant to be used as a crutch or last resort for the test. Since you have a note sheet, definitely include all the equations you have used over the course of the homework and which have been shown in class.
