  For Lab 5, in A.4, it asks to find the predicted poles. I am a bit confused about how to do that given the long expressions for the gain

  There will be two poles; one associated with the gain from V

  to V

  , and the other from V
  <sub>

  </sub>
  to V
  <sub>
   out
  </sub>
  . You should find what frequencies make the real and imaginary parts of the denominators equal for these terms (that being the definition of poles). The rest is just algebra

  ^ Correct. Given a transfer function (s) you can calculate the poles by setting the denominator of the transfer function equal to zero and solving for w. There may be more than one pole for any given system (from the template you know here there are two poles, one low frequency and one high frequency).
