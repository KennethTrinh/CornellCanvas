  For those interested, I have uploaded to Canvas a handout with the math proving the concept of amplitude modulation and demodulation. Enjoy!

  When looking at the result for the initial amplitude modulation, even though we can neglect negative frequencies, would we still have to consider the second term since cos(-x)=cos(x), making it a positive frequency? It also seems visually as though we couldn't represent the amplitude modulated wave with only one cosine term. Would this second term also drop out in the demodulation?

  I was also a little confused about that, but I worked it out with both terms and found that the result was the same when passed through a low pass filter.
