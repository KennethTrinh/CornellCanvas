  I'm not sure if the following instructions in the handout constitute a typo or if it's intentional: "𝑇𝑃𝐿𝐻 = 𝑇𝑃𝐻𝐿 = 100 𝑝s". Is it supposed to say TPLH1 = TPLH2 = 100ps? Thanks.

  No, 𝑇𝑃𝐿𝐻 = 𝑇𝑃𝐻𝐿 = 100 𝑝s is correct. Remember, for simplicity, we assume only one transistor is on and responsible for either the pull up or pull down process. So, by saying this, we're equating the propagation delay times for the pull up and pull down.

  Thanks for the clarification professor. It's my bad: I misread TPLH to be the same thing as TPHL.
