  When we drew a general structural diagram of an npn BJT, we defined the collector current to be flowing into the collector terminal. When an npn BJT is in saturation mode, however, the base-collector junction is in forward bias, which I think from my understanding would indicate that current flows from the base to the collector. Does this mean that I_c is actually flowing out of the collector terminal, in the opposite direction to our convention for npn's, when the BJT is in saturation mode?

  The current flows into the collector until the collector-emitter voltage get to nearly zero.  Think about your lab this week, you measured the collector current and found it started at zero when the V_ce=0, and grew steadily until it reached the active region  at V_ce about 1/2 V.

  The built-in reverse bias of the Base-collector junction continues to sweep up minority carriers even when the base-collector voltage is weak, but still reverse.  It stays reverse until the base-collector voltage reaches about 0.5 volts,

  From the base current perspective, there probably is a small fraction of base current that goes toward the collector as that reverse bias decreases, but the total current entering the collector is still dominant.
