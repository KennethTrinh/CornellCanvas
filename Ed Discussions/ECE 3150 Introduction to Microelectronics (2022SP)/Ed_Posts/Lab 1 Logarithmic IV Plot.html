 I'm having trouble finding Io and eta. Are we supposed to find it on the spec sheet? When I tried to find Io from my data, the left side of the graph just converges to 0.

  You need to use your diode IV curve obtained from experiment to find the Io and eta values. These values represent the best fir to your experimental IV curve. You can also use the slope of of the curve to find the diode on resistance and use that to find the variables.
