  How can I find Vbe when we are solving for voltage at E? Without Vbe presumably I cannot calculate Ic, right?

  Which question from homework 2 are you referring to? If this is just a general question, one way you could find $I_C$ or $I_E$ is by finding $I_B$, then using the device's current gain, $\beta$. You don't always need $V_{BE}$ to find $I_C$.

  I think this might be referring to question 4, where we aren't given Î²

  Then as you suggest in #83, you can assume $\beta$ is large. That gives an equation relating $I_C$ to $I_E$. It may also be helpful to think of $V_{BE}$ instead as $V_B - V_E$.
