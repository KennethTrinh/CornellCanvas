  Having some trouble finding the mode of operation of the following BJT. I'm not sure how to find $I_C$ or $V_{CE}$ given that they both depend on $V_{BE}$ (which looks like it's floating below?) and we aren't given any base current to plot. Could I get a hint?

  You don't need to plot anything yourself for this question. For Q2 you are given a bunch of output curves for the BJT, where each color corresponds to a different base current. Use this graph and the circuit diagrams to figure out the operation of each BJT. If you look at the circuit for (iii) as compared to (i) and (ii), you see there is no base current. Given this, what curve should you be looking at? Once you know which curve you are referencing, you can see the region of operation (hint: Vce might not even matter for this one...).

  #94 might also help to answer other questions about this problem.

  Thanks! Why can we assume there is no base current again?

  Unlike the first two circuits, there is no current source on the base. In the simple circuit given here there no current shown to be going into the base. BJTs are current-controlled current sources.

  Intuitively, it may be easier to think about the base-emitter junction as a sort of diode. When there is no current into the base, the base is pulled down to the emitter. This is what is happening here with the base left "floating" and there is no current flow into the base. Hopefully this explanation is helpful.
