 Hello all,
</p>
<p>
 Just a quick message to clarify that although you did the lab experiments with a lab partner, you will need to solve all the lab write-up questions independently and submit your own individual lab assignment. The point of this is for each of you (you and your lab partner) to learn through the analysis process of your lab results.
</p>
<p>
 Also, make sure to start both the lab write-up and the homework early. They are both due next Wednesday.
</p>
<p>
 Good luck!
</p>
<p>
 Prof. El-Ghazaly

  I talked with Professor Pollock after lecture on Friday (2/18), and he said we should work on the labs together as a group and submit individually. Is doing this ok?
