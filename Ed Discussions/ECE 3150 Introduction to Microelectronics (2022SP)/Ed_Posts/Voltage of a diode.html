  Is it possible for a diode to have a voltage higher than Von? For example, assuming the diode in the circuit below is silicon, can the voltage across the diode be greater than 0.7-0.8V? Or does the resistor assume any voltage that the diode cannot handle (any voltage greater than 0.7-0.8V)?

  When using a piecewise model, you can approximate the diode's behavior as two distinct modes of operation:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Suppose $V_1 &lt; V_{ON}$, then the current, $I$, is zero because the diode is not conducting. This also means that the entire voltage drop occurs across the diode ($V_1 = V_D + V_R = V_D + I \cdot R; I = 0$).
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If $V_1 \geq V_{ON}$, then the voltage drop seen across the diode is $V_{ON}$. As you suggest in your question, any remaining voltage is seen across the resistor. To find out what this voltage is, you can rearrange the previous equation as:
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  V_1=V_D+V_R\ \Longrightarrow\ V_R=V_1-V_D=V_1-V_{ON}
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  Furthermore, you could solve for the current by plugging in a known value for R:
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  V_R=I\cdot R\ \Longrightarrow\ I\ =\ \left(\frac{V_1-V_{ON}}{R}\right)
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  This can be very useful when choosing component values to prevent failures, such as blown LEDs.
