  A5 Question 2 asked us to "explain voltage across load near charge peak" and in the handout, it says "explain the shape of the voltage across the load around the peak of the charging pulse." Could anyone give us some hints on what exactly this question is asking for?

  The ripple we discussed in class appear a sinusoid the entire time the capacitor is charging, and then the capacitor starts discharging from the peak (resulting in a steady decrease from the peak). Does your data look like this? Why/why not?

  ohhh thank you! We actually have that discussion in question 1 where it asks us to explain the time-domain shape. The handout gives a hint saying that consider "the signal generator has an output impedance that is greater than zero," so we are not sure if that has some influence in the shape around the peak specifically...?
