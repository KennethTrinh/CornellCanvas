 In the above example problem, what is the reasoning behind the highlighted section? The only thing I can think of is that if 10% of the base current is moving across the BC junction instead of the BE junction, it reduces the corresponding electron flow from Emitter to Base by 10%, which decreases the Collector Current by 10%, but something still doesn't seem right. Does the portion of the Base Current that is moving across the BC junction not cancel the same amount of Collector current because they are moving in opposite directions, complicating the calculation?

 Why is the highlighted section able to be stated without any justification, as though it is obvious?
