  I'm confused on what the density of states really is. We said before that electrons occupy very specific energy levels and I thought that each one of these is a state. How can the density of state function give the number of states at an energy level if an energy level corresponds to one state?

  Hello, you may want to check the units of the term. Let me start from the formation of energy bands in solids. If you have Si atoms separated far far away from each other, each of them would have discrete energy states. As you brought the Si atoms together to make a Si crystal, electron wave functions begin to overlap, so Pauli exclusion principle matters. As you said, at most one electron should be at each energy level, and thus the discrete energy states should split into energy bands (=tightly packed discrete states) not to violate the Pauli principle.

  Let's go back to the density of states function, g(E). The unit of the function is [# of states / (eV * cm^3)]. It tells you about the number of states per unit volume per unit energy. There are so many atoms in solids; there are so many energy states as well. Each energy state is unique but tightly brought together to form energy bands in solids. If you want to count the density of energy states [# of states / cm^3], get the integral of g(E)*dE with respect to energy. The density of states function [# of states / (eV * cm^3)] does not say that there are many states at an energy level. In solids, electrons still occupy very specific energy states, and the density of states function helps you to count the number of states within certain energy range. Once you do the integration in the energy space [# of states / cm^3], then you can say that I have this many states within the energy range, not at a single energy level.

  Density of states is a little abstract.  Fermi said that only one electron can occupy a given state. Thats why there are shells in atoms, the first electron goes to 1s, then because of spin, a second electron with opposite spin can go into 1s, then that state is filled.  The next available state is 2s, then 2p, and 3s, etc.  These are distinct discrete states allowed by the atom.

  The solid is no different. A crystal has a lowest energy state, then a second state, and so forth, with each state having a slightly higher energy. Unlike the atom where the discrete jumps in energy are large, in a crystal the difference between adjacent energy levels is extremely small. But that does change the fact that there are still discrete states that the electron can occupy.

  If you analyze this using the quantum mechanical picture of an electron as a wave, you can pretty easily derive how many states exist in each little interval of "dE".  It turns out the number of available states slowly increases with energy.  We define the "density of states" as the number of states in an interval dE.  The density is a function of E. As we get further up in energy, there are more and more states.

  A simple picture is a bowl of water that has a curved interior.   When you put the ounce of water (a "dE") in it, it occupies a small region in the center of the bowl and fills it to a certain level. The next ounce (dE) has to spread out over a larger area, and does not raise the level quite as much.  Since the water level represents potential energy, we could say the density of energy states for water at that energy is larger.  If the bowl keeps getting wider as it gets higher, we would find the water level increases less and less with each additional ounce, representing the increased number of states.
