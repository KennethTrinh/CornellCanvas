 When I solve for Cj0, I get 2.27E-8 using the same numbers in the solutions. Am I missing a unit conversion or something?

  Hm. If you are using the same numbers and equation, the answer should be the same. Make sure that all your values are the same units (for example, all in cm) and that you are using the right value/form for the constants (for example, q=1.6E-16). It is also possible that you are using the wrong value for Vbi. You should have calculated the built in voltage in part b. The last thing I can think of is that you are setting up the equation incorrectly or plugging values into the wrong place. Make sure the middle term is NaNd/Na+Nd. Feel free to share a picture of your work so we can take a closer look at what might be going wrong.
