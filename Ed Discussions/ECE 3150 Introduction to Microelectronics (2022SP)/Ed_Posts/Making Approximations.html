 When I derive it with the small signal model, the resistance looking into the emitter of a BJT is
</p>
<math>
 \frac{1}{g_m}\ \left|\ \right|r_{\pi}
</math>
<p>
 In class, we approximated this as just
</p>
<math>
 \frac{1}{g_m}
</math>
<p>
 because beta &gt;&gt; 1. On the exam, can we just assume that we can always make this approximation? Or should we use the full form unless told explicitly that beta&gt;&gt;1?

  As long as you're in forward active, you can pretty much always make that assumption.
