  This may be a stupid question, but when calculating for our overall gain, what do we do about the sign? Since the common collector stage will have a positive gain, and the common emitter stage will have a negative gain, isn't the overall gain negative? do we just care about the absolute value of the gain or do we need to flip it somehow in the circuit? if our total gain is -50, would flipping the polarity of our speaker just fix it so that it sees +50?

  I think the question is more asking about the magnitude of the gain rather than the sign, so you may neglect the negative sign - in this case, it doesn’t even matter that much (the speaker will be 180 degrees out of phase with the microphone, but compression and rarefaction of air are interchangeable and won’t affect what you hear)
