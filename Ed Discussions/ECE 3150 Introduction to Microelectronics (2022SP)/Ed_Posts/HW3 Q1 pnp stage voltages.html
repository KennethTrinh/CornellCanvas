 I'm a bit lost on finding the value of RC2 in Q1. I believe I have found the base and collector currents from the transistor, I have values for VEC and VEB, but I don't know how to find the voltage of the collector relative to ground. It seems to me like the only thing that RC2 affects is the voltage of the collector, given the collector current. However, the top of the transistor is not tied to a known voltage so I don't know how to do voltage analysis to find the collector voltage. Do I need to find the pnp emitter voltage first? If so, how do I do that? Thanks.

   Yeah but what is VE? All that tells me is the relative voltage

    My emphasis was on the first sentence regarding arbitrary decisions. Sorry, I could have made that clearer.

    If you find that there are under-constrained in a design problem (which is very common), consider choosing an arbitrary value for one of your variables. When choosing a value, its usually a good idea to pick a value that makes the math easy.
