  For this question, I was able to find the overdrive voltage without finding $g_m$ by using this formula instead:

  Would this be okay, or am I missing something by not using $g_m$?

  The answers you get should be equivalent, so I'd guess it is ok - the formulas for g
  <sub>
   m
  </sub>
  are derived from that formula, so they will give the same answers.

   Strictly speaking

  , 8e specifically asks you to use g
  <sub>
   m
  </sub>
  to calculate the overdrive voltage, so it may be safer to just use the other formula for g
  <sub>
   m
  </sub>
  , although that's up to whoever's grading it
