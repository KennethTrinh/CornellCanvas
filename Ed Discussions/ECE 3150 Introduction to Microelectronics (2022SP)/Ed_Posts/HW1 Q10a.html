  Any tips on how to approach 10a? It seems very tricky when trying to use a constant voltage model and I keep running into strange contradictions.

  Hello, one way to approach the problem would be check the cases if the input was largely positive or largely negative and see which diodes are on/off. Once you figure this out, it will be easier to see when (for what input voltage), the diodes change their on/off state.

  Also, you can use "The method of assumed states". Here, you make an assumption on whether a diode on/off and try to see if that is possible or is contradictory.
