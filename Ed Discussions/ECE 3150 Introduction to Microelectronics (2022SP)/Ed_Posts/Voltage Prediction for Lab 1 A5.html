 Lab 1 A5 asks us to predict the output ripple voltage for the circuit with 33μF and 470μF capacitor. We think that the formula to use is

 where RL = 1000 Ω, Vp = 10 V, and C1 = the capacitance connected. However, we are not sure about the value of VD,on and Tin-△t. Where can we get these values from?
