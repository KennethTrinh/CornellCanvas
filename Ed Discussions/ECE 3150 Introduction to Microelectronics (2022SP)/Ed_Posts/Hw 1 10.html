  10 a) what does it mean voltage across. When say diode 1 and diode 3 are forward biased, what is considered voltage across.Is it the turn on voltage?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  10b) what exactly is a smoothing capacitor?

  I believe the "voltage across the diode" refers to the voltage drop that occurs across the diode (which would be Vdon during forward bias) or the voltage difference between the anode and cathode during reverse bias when its "open".

  A smoothing capacitor, to my knowledge, reduces the size of ripple by limiting the amount of discharge that occurs. You can refer to the Razavi textbook for an in depth explanation.

  This is correct, the voltage across refers to the turn-on and turn-off voltages when the diode is on and off respectively.

 <paragraph>
  Smoothing capacitor is what you use to smooth out a ripple voltage with, to make the output voltage look much like DC.
