  Are "intrinsic carrier concentration" and "intrinsic electron concentration" the same thing when a material hasn't been doped?

  "Intrinsic" means the semiconductor is pure, not doped. Even without extrinsic doping, because of the thermal excitation of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band over the forbidden gap, there are equilibrium electron and hole concentrations unless T = 0 K. In this scenario, the intrinsic electron and hole concentrations are the same since when one electron jumps from the valence band to the conduction band, one free electron and one hole pop up in the conduction band and valence band, respectively. So when you say intrinsic carrier concentration, this can indicate both n_i and p_i. (no difference)
