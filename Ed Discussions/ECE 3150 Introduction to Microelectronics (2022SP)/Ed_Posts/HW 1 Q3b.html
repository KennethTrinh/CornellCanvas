 I just wanted to make sure, for 3b we are just finding the electron drift current density and not the total drift current density right?

  for 3b, you are supposed to find the electron concentration that yields a 500A/cm^2 drift current density in each semiconductor given the electric field value and the intrinsic concentrations.
