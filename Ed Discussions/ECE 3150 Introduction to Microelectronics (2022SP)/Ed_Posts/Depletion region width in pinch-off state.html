  In the pinch-off state of a MOSFET (nmos for example), we drew the channel as being widest at the source side and then decreasing in width until it "pinches off" at the drain side. Why does the width of the depletion region (and thus the channel) change as we go from left to right?

  The way I am thinking about it, as we move from left to right, the potential of the semiconductor increases because we have applied a V_DS potential. As a result, the gate-semiconductor capacitor becomes less and less inverted, until the capacitor is in the "threshold" state exactly when we reach the drain. However, in the lectures on moscaps, we said that the depletion region reaches a maximum width in the threshold state and does not expand further when we go to the inversion state. How, then, is the depletion region width changing here when we go from more inverted -&gt; less inverted -&gt; threshold?

  You're correct in that the channel length doesn't change. However, from my understanding, we still generate more e-/hole pairs the further we go into inversion (corresponding to the increasing potential difference across the MOSCAP). The channel shouldn't change size, but the number of e-/hole pairs will change. I believe the diagrams in class were meant to illustrate the relative charge/carrier concentrations rather than the channel width itself
