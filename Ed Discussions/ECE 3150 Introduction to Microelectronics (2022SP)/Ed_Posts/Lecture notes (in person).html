  Are the lectures notes from yesterday going to be posted? I couldn't read the board at the end so I missed a few things and I remember the professor saying that they would be posted. Thanks!!

  I will not be posting any in-person notes. Only the virtual notes were posted. And that was a one time thing.

  Please ask to copy from a friend and definitely let me know in the moment if you canâ€™t see something I drew on the board during class.
