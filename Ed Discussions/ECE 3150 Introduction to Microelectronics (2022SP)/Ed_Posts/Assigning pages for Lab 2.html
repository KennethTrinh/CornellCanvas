  Hi, I just resubmitted my Lab 2 report and would like to reassign pages to the questions, but there seems to be no option to reselect pages on Gradescope. As such, some questions have no assigned pages. May I know if there is some way to do this, or if it is alright to leave it as such?

  I have no idea!  But we will figure it out on the fly.  If the pages are not assigned, the entire document is opened and the grader just has to scroll to find the right spot, I don't think there will be a problem.
