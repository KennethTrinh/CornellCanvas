 Sometimes rpi is written as 1/gm when beta=1 and other times it's just written as rpi.

  You might get more analytical use out of $\frac{\beta}{g_m}$, since the relationship to the Collector branch is more obvious.

  $r_{\pi}$ may be faster to write.

  They are equivalent, though, so it's really just personal preference.
