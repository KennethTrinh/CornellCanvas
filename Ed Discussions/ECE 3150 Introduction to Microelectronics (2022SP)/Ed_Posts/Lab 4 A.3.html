  Hi all,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  A.3 asks us to come up with a prediction based on the circuit's input resistance. I can't think of any predictions we made based on this in class (the only one I can think of is based on the output resistance). What model should we be using? Thanks!

  I think it’s trying to get at a voltage divider with Vs as the “source” and Vin being the voltage of Vs with Rin and Rs as the dividing resistors
