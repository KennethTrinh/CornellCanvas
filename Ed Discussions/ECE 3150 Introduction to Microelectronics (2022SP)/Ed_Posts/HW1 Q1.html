 In terms of what variable should our answer for Q1 be? We are given the following:
</p>
<math>
 V_{in},\ r_{\pi},\ v_{\pi},\ g_m,\ R_L
</math>
<p>
 Can our answer be in terms of all of them? The question never specifies.

  Your answer can be in the terms of any of them. As a hint, you should only need three of the variable you listed, try to simplify as much as possible.
