  Hello all,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Final exams have been graded. I have also applied a very large curve. Below is the original, raw score distribution:

  And, below is the final distribution, after the generous curving that I did.

  Grades will be posted on Canvas in a moment. As promised, if you did "better" on the final than on the midterm, I will also be replacing your midterm exam score with the final exam score. Given that I have curved the final AND will be adjusting the midterm grades,

   no other grade change requests will be accommodated

  It was a pleasure having you all in the class. It's been a great semester. I hope you have a wonderful summer!
