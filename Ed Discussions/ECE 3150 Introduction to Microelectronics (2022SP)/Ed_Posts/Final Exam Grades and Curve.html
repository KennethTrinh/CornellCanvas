 Hello all,
</p>
<p>
 Final exams have been graded. I have also applied a very large curve. Below is the original, raw score distribution:

 And, below is the final distribution, after the generous curving that I did.

 Grades will be posted on Canvas in a moment. As promised, if you did "better" on the final than on the midterm, I will also be replacing your midterm exam score with the final exam score. Given that I have curved the final AND will be adjusting the midterm grades,
 <b>
  no other grade change requests will be accommodated
 </b>
 .

 It was a pleasure having you all in the class. It's been a great semester. I hope you have a wonderful summer!
