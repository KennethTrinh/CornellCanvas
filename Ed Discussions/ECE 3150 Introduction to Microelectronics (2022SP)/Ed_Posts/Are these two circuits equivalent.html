  For the second circuit, Rc is 1000 not 500

  Also, the placement of the resistor is different. One is at the collector, the other is at the emitter.

  These are dramatically different circuits.  The top one has an emitter resistor.  Assume Vbe is 0.7V, we can see the emitter resistor has 0.8 volts across it, so the emitter current is 0.8 mA.  The collctor current is essentially the same, within a factor of 1/beta.

  The lower circuit has no emitter resistor.  The current will be beta x(base current) which will depend exponentially on Vb.  If it gets driven into saturation, the most current that can flow through the collector resistor is 2/500 = 4 mA, but the circuit will be very sensitive to Vb.
