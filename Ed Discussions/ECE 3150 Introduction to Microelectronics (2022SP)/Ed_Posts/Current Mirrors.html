  I think we said in class that if we construct an n-type bipolar current mirror to get I_copy, we must build a p-type common emitter circuit on top to use the I_copy:

  Why couldn't we connect an n-type circuit like this instead?

  You can do that, but then instead of it being a common emitter amp with high gain of
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  -g_m\left(r_{o,n}\parallel r_{o,p}\right)
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  (assuming the ro,n of the current source is parallel to the ro,p of the pnp amp) you'll get a common emitter amp with emitter degeneration and lower gain of
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  \frac{-r_{o,n}}{\frac{1}{g_m}+r_{o,p}}
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  assuming 1/gm is much smaller than ro,p then this gain is nearly -1.

  Also, as you've drawn it now, vout is tied to Vdd, so would not be able to provide any small signal sensitivity to the input. You would need a resistor up top between the Vout and Vdd.
