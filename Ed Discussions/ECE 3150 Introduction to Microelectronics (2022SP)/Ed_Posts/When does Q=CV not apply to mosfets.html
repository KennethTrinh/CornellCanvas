  Hello,
 </p>
 <p>
  I guess you are talking about the following equation that relates the charge of the MOSFET channel with the applied gate bias.
 </p>
 <math>
  Q_{MOS}=C_{ox}\cdot\left(V_{GS}-V_{th}\right)\ \left[\frac{C}{cm^2}\right]
 </math>
 <p>
  So why do we use (V_GS - V_th) instead of just V_GS? If you look at the capacitance term, it's the oxide capacitance, which can be represented as follows.
 </p>
 <math>
  C_{ox}=\frac{\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_{ox}}{t_{ox}}\ \left[\frac{F}{cm^2}\right]
 </math>
 <p>
  The capacitance of the MOS capacitor, which is the gate stack of a MOSFET, goes to C_ox only when a MOSFET is in either inversion or accumulation. Otherwise, the effective capacitance of a MOSFET is smaller than C_ox. (So called quantum capacitance of silicon is in series with the oxide capacitance in this case) In the first equation, we assume that the MOSFET capacitance is same with C_ox. To make this assumption valid and have the inversion channel charge, we need to make sure the device is in the inversion mode. That's why we use (V_GS - V_th) instead of just V_GS; V_GS should be larger than V_th to be in the inversion mode. We don't want to run in the accumulation mode since there's no current flowing in the channel.
