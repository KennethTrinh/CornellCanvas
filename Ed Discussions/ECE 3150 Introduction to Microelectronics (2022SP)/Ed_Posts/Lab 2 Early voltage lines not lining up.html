  Here's my graph of collector current vs. collector-emitter voltage. The dotted lines are from me extrapolating the line back to the x-axis, and none of the lines have the same x-intercept. What do I do?

  I had the same result. Surprisingly, the pnp graph was perfectly aligned when I extrapolated that one

  Yes, the npn has a large Early voltage, and thus there is a small slope for each line.  Any small deviation is exaggerated.  Your data looks consistent with others.  For the box asking for the Early voltage, just take an average of the 5 lines.

  My pnp data was much more consistent, but the voltage was closer to 22V.
