 It says, "Note that these are normalized data to the value of ùõΩ at 8 mA." What does this mean (what is 8 mA? I_B?) Are we supposed to use this information to transform our measurements in some way?

  To un-normalize the Figure 15 data, first identify the $\beta$ value at 8mA from your measured data. That is the value that a $\beta$ of 1 corresponds to on the data sheet (i.e. $\beta_{un-normalized}^{datasheet} = \beta_{normalized}^{datasheet} \cdot \beta_{I_C = 8mA}^{measured}$).

   But my Œ≤ at I_C = 0.008 is 212. 40 * 212  = 8480?

    My beta at 0.008 was also a similar value?

     $\beta_{normalized}^{datasheet}$ for the $I_C$ = 8mA case has a value of one. If you look at Figure 15 from the data sheet, the values for $\beta_{normalized}^{datasheet}$ range from 0.1 to 2. The 212 can be treated as a constant which is multiplied by whatever value is read from the data sheet‚Äîa number between 0.1 and 2.
