 Hi everyone,
</p>
<p>
 We're using Ed Discussion for class Q&amp;A.
</p>
<p>
 This is the best place to ask questions about the course, whether curricular or administrative. You will get faster answers here from staff and peers than through email.
</p>
<p>
 Here are some tips:
</p>
<list style="bullet">
 <li>
  <p>
   Search before you post
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Heart questions and answers you find useful
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Answer questions you feel confident answering
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   <b>
    Private posts should ONLY be used when sharing personal information or your own work.
   </b>
   Staff reserves the right to make any post public that we think can benefit the rest of the class and does not include private information.
  </p>
 </li>
</list>
