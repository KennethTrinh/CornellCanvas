 For this layout, are the nodes along the middle still a virtual ground? More generally, will the middle nodes
 <i>
  always
 </i>
 be virtual grounds even if there is no ideal current bias?

  Yes, so long as the transistors are matched, and the inputs are differential, the central axis of the circuit will always behave like a virtual ground to AC signals.  In this case, the currents in M1 and M2 will be identiacal, and equal to half the total current running through M5.
