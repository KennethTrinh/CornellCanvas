  Are Is1 and Is2 equal? They are both set equal to I0. Also, if those are equal, I assume Vd1 and Vd2 are also equal then making them identical diodes. Is that correct?

  They are not equal. They mean that the models are:
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  I_{D1}=I_{s1}\left[\exp\left(\frac{V_{D1}}{V_T}\right)-1\right]
 </math>
 <math>
  I_{D2}=I_{s2}\left[\exp\left(\frac{V_{D2}}{V_T}\right)-1\right]
 </math>

  Are the voltages equal though? I created the circuit in LT spice and it seems like the voltage of each diode is V/2.

  For the purpose of this question, where the goal is to write the full equation for each diode voltage, they are not equal. You can write an equation for Vg in terms of Vd1 and Vd2. Then you can solve for either one first, and when you plug in to calculate the other, you will see they are not the same final equation.

  I'm assuming you're talking about using KVL. That makes sense, and I'm assuming we're also supposed to use the current to help us find Vd1 and Vd2.

  I'm confused on how we're supposed to find i for this problem, since above it says the diode currents aren't equal. How can there be a singular i for the entire circuit but then the diode currents are different? Maybe my mistake is still thinking of this as a linear circuit.

  Yes, KVL can help find the diode voltages.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The currents going through the diode (little i) are the same because they are in the same current branch. What is different is the saturation current (big I) used in the diode model equation. Since you know the same current i is going through both diodes, you can solve for i by writing the diode current equation for one diode. Then, you would have to plug in your equations for Vd1 and Vd2 into the i equation. You can simplify this combined equation to get i in terms of Vg, Vt, Is1 and Is2

  Makes a lot more sense, thank you so much!
