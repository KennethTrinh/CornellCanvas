<p>
 in the midterm we were asked to determine which operating condition has a higher current amplification factor.
</p>
<p>
 The solutions said that beta can be attributed to the reverse electric field, so it's not applicable in saturation.
</p>
<p>
 If we had been asked to compare beta for inverse, cutoff and forward active, would this be correct?
</p>
<p>
 Forward active: reverse bias across the c-b junction, higher potential drop, higher beta
</p>
<p>
 Inverse: reverse across e-b junction, lower potential drop, lower beta
</p>
<p>
 Cutoff: reverse across both junctions, electrons can't pass from the base's energy level to the collector's because the potential difference is too high. No current, no beta?
