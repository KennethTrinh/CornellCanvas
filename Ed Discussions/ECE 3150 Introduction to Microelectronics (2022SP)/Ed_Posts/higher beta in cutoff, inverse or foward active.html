 <paragraph>
  in the midterm we were asked to determine which operating condition has a higher current amplification factor.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The solutions said that beta can be attributed to the reverse electric field, so it's not applicable in saturation.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If we had been asked to compare beta for inverse, cutoff and forward active, would this be correct?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Forward active: reverse bias across the c-b junction, higher potential drop, higher beta
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Inverse: reverse across e-b junction, lower potential drop, lower beta
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Cutoff: reverse across both junctions, electrons can't pass from the base's energy level to the collector's because the potential difference is too high. No current, no beta?
