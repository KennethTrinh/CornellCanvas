 From lecture on 2/21, the emitter degeneration circuit has I_e approximately equal to I_c. Clearly, if this was true, then by KCL, I_b would be near zero. But that isn't the case in this problem. So when can we apply the I_e = I_c approximation?

  Whether or not the circuit has  an emitter resistor, I_c is always nearly equal to I_e.  This assumes beta is on the order of 100.  The only significant difference when an emitter resistor is added is that the base voltage V_b  rises by I_e R_r.  This is in addition to the V_be which is always present in the forward biased transistor.
 </p>
 <p>
  The emitter resistor makes the transisor much less sensitive to changes in temperature.  As a transistor gets hotter, the currents tend to increase (due to I_s). But as the current through the emitter resistor increases, so does the voltage. If  V_b is fixed, V_be is reduced, which reduces the current increase.  So R_e acts like a negative feedback resistor.

   This case only applies when
  </p>
  <math>
   \beta\gg1
  </math>
  <p>
   In this problem, it might be intuitive to apply that; however, part (a) asks you to solve without using this approximation. You can note from the results, however, that:
  </p>
  <math>
   \beta\longrightarrow\infty;I_B\longrightarrow0A,V_B\longrightarrow\frac{R_2}{R_1+R_2}
  </math>
  <p>
   as you'd expect from this approximation (and the results you find in part (b) will be close to this)
  </p>

    Thank you, that makes sense since its the ratio between I_b and I_c
