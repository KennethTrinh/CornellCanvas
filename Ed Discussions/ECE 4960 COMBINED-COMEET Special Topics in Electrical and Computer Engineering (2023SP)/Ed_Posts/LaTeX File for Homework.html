  Is it possible to get this type of file for homeworks to easily type each solution under each question?

  Hi, unfortunately that is not possible as I have a unique latex file with the solutions included. Maybe you can take screenshots and include then as images? Also, it is ok if your solution doesn't include the questions. Just clearly write
  <bold>
   solution to Exercise X
  </bold>
  before each.
