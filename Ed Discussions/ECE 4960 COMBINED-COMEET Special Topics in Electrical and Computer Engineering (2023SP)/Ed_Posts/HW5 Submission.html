  As you mentioned in class, we are allowed to drop one homework assignment, and I was wondering if it would be possible for me to not submit HW5.

  Yes if you are happy with your first 4 homeworks you can avoid submitting homework 5. Please note that however I will not upload the grade of homework 4 until after the deadline for homework 5 has passed, hence you will gamble on the grade of homework 4.
