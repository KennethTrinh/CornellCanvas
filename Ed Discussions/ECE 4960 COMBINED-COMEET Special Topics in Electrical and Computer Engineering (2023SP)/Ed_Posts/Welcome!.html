 We're using Ed Discussion for class Q&amp;A.
</p>
<p>
 This is the best place to ask questions about the course, whether curricular or administrative. You will get faster answers here from staff and peers than through email.
</p>
<p>
 Here are some tips:

  Good day, can remote students join the class live? No one joined the zoom links Tuesday and Thursday.

   Hi, what do you mean by remote students? Students enrolled in the Distant Learning version of the class are definitely welcome to watch and participate live, all other students should come to class and participate in person. If for some reason you cannot attend one or two classes you are welcome to join the streaming live but that should not be the norm for on campus students. Hope that helps,
  </p>

    Sorry I meant Distance Learning. So is the link to the live session different than the zoom link on canvas?

     No this is the same link, maybe you are connecting at the wrong times? The class is  11.25-12.40am EST Monday and Wednesday.
