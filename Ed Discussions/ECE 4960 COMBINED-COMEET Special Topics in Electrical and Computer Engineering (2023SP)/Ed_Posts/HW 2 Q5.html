  Is this graph supposed to be directed or undirected? I know for directed graphs we have both in and out degrees. But undirected only has one degree value.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Also, how do we normalize the plot? Is this plot supposed to be a bar plot?

  You can verify that the graph in undirected by checking that A=A'. And yes for undirected graphs in and out degree are the same.

  As written in the question the plot should have the node labels in the x-axis and the centrality measures in the the y-axis (normalized so that they sum up to one). This is not a bar plot. It is a plot of a function f(x) where x is the node label and f is the corresponding value of centrality
