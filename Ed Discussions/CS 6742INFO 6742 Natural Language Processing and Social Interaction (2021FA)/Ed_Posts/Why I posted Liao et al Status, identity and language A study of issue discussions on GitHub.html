  because it shows an interesting example --- for those of you who might be thinking of using the most modern deep-learning methods for your projects, but don't see how it's amenable to hypothesis-driven research,  of:

    using deep learning, often thought of as not amenable for understanding feature contributions (since the representation is learned, not supplied), for classification, but
