 Totally forgot to say that I posted the following paper to the lecture website for today

   Liao, Jingxian, Guowei Yang, David Kavaler, Vladimir Filkov, and Prem Devanbu. 2019.

 because it shows an interesting example --- for those of you who might be thinking of using the most modern deep-learning methods for your projects, but don't see how it's amenable to hypothesis-driven research,  of:
</p>
<list style="bullet">
 <li>
  <p>
   using deep learning, often thought of as not amenable for understanding feature contributions (since the representation is learned, not supplied), for classification, but

 <li>
  <p>
   then uses an
   <i>
    ablation
   </i>
   methodology to use the deep learning architecture to investigate particular features of interest.
  </p>
 </li>
</list>
<p>
 So, for example, they give classification accuracy, but then, to investigate the effect of closed- vs open-category words, they replace all the open-category words with a special single token and re-run the classification.
