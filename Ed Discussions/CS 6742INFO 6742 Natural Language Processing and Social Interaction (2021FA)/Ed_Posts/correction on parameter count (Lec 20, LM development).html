  2 possible states times $\ell$ possible positions is 2 $\times$ $\ell$, not $2^\ell$!  So where we only model position (not past history) is a lot fewer parameters than I for some reason said in class.

  Also, the estimate I stated for the number of transitions in the history-based model was way too loose, because each non-final state has only two non-zero-probability following states (not $2^\ell$, which is on the order of the number of all states): the one with the small-talk state ${\sf st}$ next and the one with the non-small-talk state  ${\sf nst}$ next.
