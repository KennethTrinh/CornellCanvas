 Over the next week, I will complete the following:
</p>
<list style="bullet">
 <li>
  <p>
   Set up the labeling task: Fede and I have decided to use Prodigy for labeling posts since I already have experiences using it (plus I made setup instructions that could be reused) and it seems like we can share our license with 1-2 other Cornell affiliated people if we need more labeled data. I will set up a labeling task so that we can easily switch between types of labels (relationships, intent, topic) and easily merge the data after labeling. I will also work with Fede to get Prodigy set up on her computer.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Labeling: I will begin labeling posts based on six different relationship categories: friends, family, partners, therapist, doctors, and the reddit support community. I hope to label enough sentences so that we can design a simple prediction task to see how the performance of the model is based on the amount of labeled data.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Fede and I will reconvene to discuss how the labeling task goes. These labels are clearer/simpler than our prior labels and should work better, but there's a chance that we may need to adjust again if they don't seem fitting/clear.
  </p>
 </li>

  Since writing this commitment statement, I began by setting up Prodigy for the three different labeling tasks: relationships, subjects, and intent. Now, Fede and I can easily switch between labeling schemes, add new labels, and access/merge the labeled data. I updated some instructions that I previously created on how to set up Prodigy based on a machine, so I also have instructions that could be shared easily if we want to get anyone else set up with labeling.

  I began by labeling the relationships category, with the following six categories: family, friend, partner, doctor, therapist, and endo support community. If the relationships category is mentioned in a post, then I label the post as having that relationship in it. This means that there are many posts with multiple labels (especially endo support community and doctors) and some without any of the relationship categories--though that is rare. The most common category is, perhaps unsurprisingly, the endo support community. Many posts begin or end with a note directed toward the community, either asking them for support, experiences, or information or stating that they hope to help other people in the community by sharing.
 </p>
 <p>
  I did notice a few categories that seemed to be missing. One (very interesting) type of post occurs when the author of the post doesn't have endo; they post to the community to see how they can help someone they are closely connected to with endo. I added the "non-endo-author" category so that we can catch these moments, since it feels very important if we are curious about how people discuss, experience, and mediate their relationships and find support for endo. I also added an "other" category for moments where the OP discusses coworkers, pets, etc. since these are still relationships, albeit uncommonly referenced. So far, I have labeled over 200 posts, and have found the relationship category fairly easy to identify and label.
 </p>

  Fede and I met last week and discussed changing the labels she uses for the topics, given that we began by only considering symptoms. We agreed to add a few more labels to that category, and that I would try labeling some of the topics category since it's more difficult to identify in comparison to the relationships category.

   As I said to Fede (

   ), glad to see the refinement-of-labels process! Great fodder for a paper: "You might at first think that you can label in such-and-so way. But in reality, there are further subtleties." (That is, rather than only talk about the final label set in a writeup/paper submission, give yourself credit by noting that refinement was necessary.)
