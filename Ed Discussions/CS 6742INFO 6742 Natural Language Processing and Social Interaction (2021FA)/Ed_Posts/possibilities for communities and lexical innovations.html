   anticipate: issues with defining what is a "lexical innovation" - "no country" did: word never used before, used &gt;=10 times by multiple users
   <i>
    talking about different products
   </i>
   [think about that -- is "iphone1634" a lexical innovation for your purposes] for a period of 6 months after first use.

 Exploring the Friendships, Rivalries, and Trysts between Ideas in Texts
</heading>
<p>
 Ideas have been competing and collaborating throughout our history. For instance, it took a long time for
 <b>
  <i>
   Copernican heliocentrism
  </i>
 </b>
 to win out over the
 <b>
  <i>
   geocentric model
  </i>
 </b>
 in the western world; we are now experiencing a competition between
 <b>
  <i>
   protectionism
  </i>
 </b>
 and
 <b>
  <i>
   globalization
  </i>
 </b>
 . In this blog, we introduce a simple yet effective framework to explore the
 <b>
  relations
 </b>
 between ideas from our paper in ACL 2017,
