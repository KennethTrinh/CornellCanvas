 I misremembered how the CMV comment pairs were selected [in fact, there was not a temporal control and the length control was complicated --- I confused these facts with what happened in a different project].

 Documentation on pairing is in Section 4.1 of the
 <a href="https://chenhaot.com/papers/changemyview.html">
  Winning Arguments paper
 </a>
 with relevant excerpts here:
</p>
<list style="bullet">
 <li>
  <p>
   [from Section 3] A direct reply to an original post is called a root reply ... The author of a root reply is a root challenger
   <break>
   </break>
   <break>
   </break>
   A path constitutes all nodes from root reply to a leaf node.
   <break>
   </break>
   <break>
   </break>
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   We define all replies in a path by the root challenger as a rooted path-unit
   <break>
   </break>
   <break>
   </break>
  </p>

   In response to the same original post, there are many possible ways to change someone’s view. We aim to find linguistic factors that can help one formulate her/his argument, rather than to analyze reasoning strategies.... Hence, for each rooted path-unit that wins a ∆, we find the rooted path-unit in the same discussion tree that did not win a ∆ but was the most “similar” in topic. We measure similarity between rooted path-units based on Jaccard similarity in the root replies after removing stopwords
   <break>
   </break>

<list style="bullet">

  <p>
   We further avoid trivial cases, such as replies that are not arguments but clarifying questions, by removing cases where the root
   <break>
   </break>
   reply has fewer than 50 words. In order to make sure that there are
   <break>
   </break>
   enough counterarguments that the OP saw, motivated by the results
   <break>
   </break>
   in §3.2, we also require that there are at least 10 challengers in the
   <break>
   </break>
   discussion tree and at least 3 unsuccessful rooted path-units before
   <break>
   </break>
   the last reply that the OP made in the discussion tree

   In an ideal world, we would control for both length... and topic ..., but we don’t have the luxury of having enough data to do so. [see paper for description of more discussion of ways to length-control]
