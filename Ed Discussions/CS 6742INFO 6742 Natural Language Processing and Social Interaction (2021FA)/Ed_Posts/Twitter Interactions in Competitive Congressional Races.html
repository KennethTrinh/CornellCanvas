  Motivation/Hypotheses:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Social media has become increasingly important in congressional elections. While only 22% of the American public uses Twitter, it's role in politics cannot be understated. Politicians may use Twitter to make official statements or engage with news outlets while activists may use Twitter to galvanize bystanders or interact with politicians. Unfortunately, not all of these interactions are positive and can have significant impact on the public discourse. Toxicity and online abuse may be used to scare potential candidates and may even translate to violent attacks as seen with the 2021 capitol insurrection. While Hua et. al have studied adversarial twitter interactions, there is no mention of the candidate's races and how competitive they are.

 <paragraph>
  H1: Candidates in competitive congressional races will receive more abusive comments than those in non-competitive races
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  H2: Comments in competitive races where there was a partisan change will have higher arousal and dominance, regardless if the comment is abusive or not
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  H3: Majority of the tweets will have a neutral sentiment
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Data:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I will use the U.S. Midterm Election Twitter dataset 2018 and the Midterm 2018 candidates dataset. The election Twitter dataset has 1.7 million tweets involving candidates from Sept 17th, 2018 to Nov 6th, 2018. The candidates dataset includes all primary candidates for the House and Senate along with the gubernatorial candidates.

    For each candidate's twitter, gather all tweets that have mentioned them, retweeted them, or replied to them. Use the Perspective API to determine the likelihood of it being toxic.

    For each candidate's twitter, gather all tweets that have mentioned them, retweeted them, or replied to them. Scan the words to see if they appear in the list of arousal words or dominant words. Count the number of words that appear on the list and normalize the value.

  I'm curious if we could collab or somehow cross-reference each others' ideas? Seems like you're looking more at post content and I'm more interested in post authorship
