 ... on innovation:

<blockquote>
 To measure scientific innovation, we first identify the set of scientific concepts being employed in theses. For this, we use natural language processing techniques of phrase extraction and structural topic modeling (

 22,
 <link href="https://www.pnas.org/content/117/17/9284#ref-23"/>
 23) to identify terms representing substantive concepts in millions of documents (# concepts, mean = 56.500; median = 57; SD = 19.440; see

 24). Next, we filter and identify when pairs of meaningful concepts are first related to one another in a thesis. By summing the number of novel conceptual co-occurrences within each thesis, we develop a measure of how conceptually novel a thesis and author are (# new links)—their novelty. However, not all novel conceptual linkages are taken up in ensuing works and have the same impact on scholarship. To capture impactful novelty, we measure how often a thesis’s new conceptual linkages are adopted in ensuing documents of each year (uptake per new link) (

 ) Examples drawn from the data illustrate our measures of novelty and impactful novelty. Nodes represent concepts, and link thickness indicates the frequency of their co-usage. Students can introduce new links (dotted lines) as their work enters the corpus. These examples concern novel links taken up at significantly higher rates than usual (e.g., 95 uses of Schiebinger’s link after 1984). The mean (median) uptake of new links is 0.790 (0.333), and ∼50% of new links never gets taken up. (

 25), and her thesis introduced the link between “HIV” and “monkeys,” indicating innovation in scientific writing as HIV’s origins are often attributed to nonhuman primates. (

 ) Londa Schiebinger was the first to link “masculinity” with “justify,” reflecting her pioneering work on gender bias in academia (
