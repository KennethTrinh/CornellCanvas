  A combination of "happy" and "sad": the Reddit API that Chenhao used to collect that r/changemyview dataset
  <link href="https://old.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/8r756k/a_dropin_pushshift_replacement_for_the_deprecated/"/>
  no longer supports scraping old submissions within a given time range, but I did figure out an implementation that uses PushShift (third party server that automatically scrapes all Reddit activity... just doesn't do as well with post edits, with a public API) to collect pretty much the same data!

  I shared this with Lillian during our meeting today that she thought I should share with the whole class. I've been running my project models on the Cornell Center for Social Sciences (CCSS) remote servers. While training my neural network I received an email from the server moderator essentially telling me that I was a "high computing needs user" (aka a total CPU hog) and I therefore should be removed from the server so I didn't slow down everyone else in the process. My call out ended up being a great thing however, since they decided to set me up with my own personal cloud server to use! (Full disclosure that I work for CCSS so that probably has a big role in my happy ending rather than just getting completely booted off)

  There's going to be a talk during the CS grad seminar tomorrow (noon Wed Nov 17 in Gates 122) where a student

  "will show us some linguistic theory that clarifies relationships between comments and code.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <bold>
   Abstract
  </bold>
  : Superlinguistics is an emerging field of linguistics that attempts to apply well-established linguistic theories to non-linguistic domains such as images, comics, and film. Why not code too? I'll argue that superlinguistics can help answer questions like
  <italic>
   what is the relationship between comments and code
  </italic>
  ? or
  <italic>
   how do variable names affect code comprehension
  </italic>
  ? or even
  <italic>
   is my code correct
  </italic>
  ?"
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  and I think that's super cool and relevant to my project!

  Looks like there's even a class:

  (Although I don't think I approve of the term "superlinguistics", particularly as a acknowledged subfield of "linguistics"... but I'm not going to argue with Prof. Abusch)
