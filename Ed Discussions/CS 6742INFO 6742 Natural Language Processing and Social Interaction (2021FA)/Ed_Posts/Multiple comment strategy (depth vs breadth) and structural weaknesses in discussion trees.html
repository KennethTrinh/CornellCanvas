 Tan et al. not only consider language indicators in understanding persuasion--they also look at the graphical structure of discussion trees (e.g. by considering the length of back-and-forth or the number of subtrees). Interestingly, they provide some evidence that while more responses correlate positively with conversion, diversity of counterarguments is likely more important than sheer number of challengers, which can even be counter-productive. They also find that long back-and-forths from the same person can lead to low success (as a challenger may come off as stubborn). I am interested in these graphical weaknesses/strengths in a user, or group of users’, response strategy. Extending Tan et. al.’s analysis, my project will delve into reddit users’ multi-comment strategies. I am interested in particularly breadth-oriented coverage versus depth-oriented coverage in comments, and their comparative impact on conversion. These results will have implications for moderators (who may want to constrain users from a certain breadth or depth of commenting) and for interlocutors, who may want to be more strategic with their comments.

 In particular, I believe the following questions can be fruitful:
 <break>
 </break>
 &gt; When the same person comments on many sub-trees, are they harming the overall chances of conversion (e.g. inserting the same personal risks/liabilities to the entire tree structure?)
</p>
<p>
 &gt; Do double- or triple- or quadruple-comments that agree with each other harm conversion or cause subtree death?
</p>
<p>
 &gt; If OP has backup (people who defend against many challengers) does this have an outsized mitigatory effect on persuasion?
</p>
<p>
 <break>

 I believe this project’s focus on the structure of discussion trees is important because of the main points from the A1 readings. The “Attacked from Within” reading argues that content moderation and classification can focus too much on individual comments rather than entire conversations. The piece contends that commenting is about relationships, and the network structure between people is far richer than the text of individual comments. In a similar vein, the Hovy &amp; Yang piece emphasizes “social factors” (including social relation and speaker/receiver and culture and ideology) as important to NLP research which too often fixates on information content. For instance, if somebody posts a topic that is a hot-button cultural/ideological issue, and many share the communicative goal of defending one side or the other, we might see a lot of breadth-coverage in responses from people who want to respond to every point raised. These strategies may not ultimately be as successful as focusing all attention/expertise to one subtree.

  During checkup meeting:
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  1. Could you post 2-3 permalinks of OPs where there's at least one root challenger returning multiple times in diff subtrees?  I'd love to see some examples very quickly before we meet!   (I'm very interested that there are lots of them).
 </p>
 <p>
  2. for q1: look at both average, max, (discarding OPS and bots), is there "clustering" of multisubthread people?

     A pretty big post where the user 'garnteller' touches on 10 different subtrees:
     <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/51yzgr/cmv_gary_johnson_asking_what_is_aleppo_isnt_a_bad/">

      <break>
      </break>
      and a smaller (and OP-was-less-responsive?) post where 'Ansuz07' also is on 10 branches:

      and on this post, 'IAmAN00bie' does the same

     I'm not sure exactly what you mean? Maybe these graphs - each point represents a single unique user, ignoring OP, DeltaBot, and AutoModerator: (also, the "average # of branches" should be "log(avg number of branches)")

   Also, here's an example of how a small but still interesting tree structure looks (would ideally color each node according to unique authorship / users, but I haven't yet figured out how to get the library to do that easily....)

    I find this pretty interesting, and would be up to collab on this!
    <break>
    </break>
    (My proposal was way more specific on OP's engagement with a range of comments)

     Hi Joyce! I'd love to work with you! We can work something out between our two proposals, as I believe they are related.

  For the second research question, should I understand a "triple comment" as a section of a path in a conversation tree (so, a comment, and then a reply to that comment, and then a reply to that reply)?
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  If so, there's an aspect of CMV that unfortunately makes the second research question a little tricky to approach, depending on the meaning of comments "agreeing with each other":  Rule 5 (
  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_5">
   https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_5
  </a>
  ), "
  <b>
   Responses must contribute meaningfully to the conversation
  </b>
  ", which, among the things that are ruled out:  "Responses that just express agreement, such as “You’re right” or “Great post”. You are allowed to agree with someone in your response, but you must also add something to the discussion in the process. If you just want to call out a post as good without adding anything to the discussion, use the Upvote button."
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  What I mean is, if the intent was to look at effects of "lots of 'I agree, too' [and little other contribution]" posts, then those posts are removed by the moderators as being low effort.  (I thought this notion might be what prompted the third research question.)
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  But if the intent is to look at "lots of (different) arguments with the same conclusion in a thread", then the research question is OK.

   Yes, the intent is to look at lots of different arguments among commenters who (we think) are trying to change OP's mind. We then do some general characterizations of those posts that 1) come from the same user 2) are on different branches and 3) are not deleted (i.e. they are substantive)

   I have a clarification question for the first research question: the OP themselves must by Rule E (see comment to
   <a href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/8208/discussion/594941">
    https://edstem.org/us/courses/8208/discussion/594941
   </a>
   ) respond to (most) challenges, and so by following the rules should appear in many trees.  Is the thinking to exclude OP from that analysis, or to include them (but treat them as a special case, presumably)?

    Update: We are now only considering the "success" of responders to OP and not OP themselves.
