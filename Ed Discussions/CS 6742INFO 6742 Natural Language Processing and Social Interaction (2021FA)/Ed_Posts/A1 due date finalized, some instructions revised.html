 I couldn't find a great way to visualize the what precisely has changed, but here is a diff file, for those who want the blow-by-blow. To see it in full color-coded glory, take a look at
 <link href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9706492/git-diff-output-to-file-preserve-coloring"/>
 this Stack Overflow page
 for suggestions. (Short answer: use command-line
 <code>
  cat
 </code>
 (but not
 <code>
  more
 </code>
 : paging doesn't retain the colors)  Vim, Notepad++, SublimeText to view.)
