 My proposal was inspired by the discussion of interaction dynamics in Tan et al. (2016). Tan et al. (2016)  observe that, in the r/ChangeMyView data, the likelihood of the OP changing his or her view increases with the number of unique challengers, but with diminishing marginal returns. Moreover, when considering the number of challengers separately from counterargument diversity, Tan et al. (2016) find that single-challenger subtrees do better than multiple-challenger subtrees at changing the OP’s view. The authors suggest that this may be due to, among other reasons, additional challengers not adding value to arguments.
</p>
<p>
 Following this train of thought, I wondered whether an OP’s responses would show noticeably less engagement once the number of arguments exceeds a certain threshold. My curiosity stems from discussions on cognitive resource constraints and heuristic decision-making in the social sciences. [This reasoning seems compatible with the results on early entry and back-and-forth that Tan et al. (2016) present, as well.] One might then expect that the features of persuasive arguments may differ across discussion trees with varying numbers of challengers. For example, words that excite – and, presumedly, grab more attention – may have a stronger impact than calm words in a multi-challenger subtree.
</p>
<p>
 Operationally, I believe this project would require 1.) a reasonable threshold for number of challengers in a discussion tree; 2.) measures of interplay with the OP’s statement that substantively differ between discussion trees above and below said threshold; and 3.) a method to evaluate the predictive accuracy of these measures conditional on the number of challengers in the discussion tree.  Any advice on these points (and or possible groupmates) would be much appreciated! Thank you!

  Posted a reference on interplay between challenger and OP on

   , but that ref may be more relevant to this project!  See bottom of post.

   The paired CMV data does have a filter of "In order to make sure that there are enough counterarguments that the OP saw, motivated by the results in §3.2, we also require that there are at least 10 challengers in the discussion tree" (Section 4.1). If 10 challengers is too high a threshold, do avoid the paired folder of the dataset.

   Incidentally, a very simply measure of engagement might be "number of words in response" (remembering to discard quotations), to start with?
