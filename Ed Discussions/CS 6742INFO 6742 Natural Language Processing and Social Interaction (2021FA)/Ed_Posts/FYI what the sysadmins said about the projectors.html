 The main projector toggle switch was turned off. It's on the back of the projector near the top. This is the second time this semester that somebody has turned this off.

 I have turned it back on.

 The side projector in that room has an old long VGA cable. Some computers have enough power to send a signal through the HDMI -&gt; VGA cable.

 For a mac it is better to use a USB-C -&gt; VGA for that type of connection. A USB-C -&gt; HDMI -&gt; VGA is two dongles, and that seldom works well.

  Yesterday I tried USB-C -&gt; VGA.  In class, that failed (with the flickering behavior), but

  class, it succeeded!  Go figure ...
