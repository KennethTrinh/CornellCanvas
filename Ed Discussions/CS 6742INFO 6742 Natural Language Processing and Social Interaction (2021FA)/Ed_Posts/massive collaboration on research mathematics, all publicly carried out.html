  The Polymath projects have an explicitly articulated set of guidelines that strongly encourage participants to share all of their ideas via online comments in very small increments as they happen, rather than thinking off-line and waiting to contribute a larger idea in a single chunk. We can thus see, through the comments made on the site during the project, almost all the ideas, experiments, mistakes, and coordination mechanisms that participants contributed. Attempts to think about the nature of the collaboration underpinning Polymath lead naturally to analogies in several different directions. One analogy is to the online collaborations one finds in other settings, such as Wikipedia [10] and open-source software projects [18]. A second analogy is to large decentralized collaborations that take place in “traditional” scientific research [9]. But both analogies are limited. The first does not quite fit because our existing models of collaborative work on the Internet involve domains where the task is inherently “doable”: the feasibility of the task — authoring an encyclopedia article or writing an open-source computer program to match a known specification — is not in doubt, and the primary challenge is to achieve the requisite level of scale and robustness. In Polymath, on the other hand, we see people who are the best in the world at what they do struggling with a task that might be beyond them or impossible as they work on open problems in their field. The second analogy also does not quite fit: as noted by Gowers [6], decentralized scientific collaborations have typically focused on problems that are inherently decomposable into separate pieces. With Polymath, on the other hand, we see problems that present themselves initially as a unified whole, and any decomposition needs to arise from the collaboration itself. Anyone with Internet access can participate for any period of time that they wish. For all these reasons, Polymath provides a glimpse into a novel kind of activity — the use of Internet collaboration to undertake world-class research — in a way that is not only open but completely chronicled.
