  The mention of text emoticons in the tokenization tutorial that we looked at today made me curious about how Unicode (or image) emoticons have been handled in sentiment analysis...

   <paragraph>
    For Unicode, I think there is the standard underlying code for each emote that might be able to be processed reliably, but does the different rendering of these emoji on different platforms (e.g. old Google Hangouts blobs vs Apple round faces?) make a difference in how they're used or what they mean?

   <paragraph>
    What about custom "emoji", like the images that Discord users can upload and use in the same way they'd normally access Unicode emoji? (And to extend that... what about animated custom emoji?)

  I'm only just googling around, but here's an example paper that miraculously deals with the different-platforms/different interpretations!

  Emoji are commonly used in modern text communication. However, as graphics with nuanced details, emoji may be open to interpretation. Emoji also render differently on different viewing platforms (e.g., Apple’s iPhone vs. Google’s Nexus phone), potentially leading to communication errors. We explore whether emoji renderings or differences across platforms give rise to diverse interpretations of emoji. Through an online survey, we solicit people’s interpretations of a sample of the most popular emoji characters, each rendered for multiple platforms. Both in terms of sentiment and semantics, we analyze the variance in interpretation of the emoji, quantifying which emoji are most (and least) likely to be misinterpreted. In cases in which participants rated the same emoji rendering, they disagreed on whether the sentiment was positive, neutral, or negative 25% of the time. When considering renderings across platforms, these disagreements only increase. Overall, we find significant potential for miscommunication, both for individual emoji renderings and for different emoji renderings across platforms.

  One thing I liked about sentiment analysis is how creative people are with regular old roman-alphabet characters to express themselves.

  This paper --- with a title that was impossible for me to reconstruct from memory or google even though I knew it had "a lot of ooos" in it, let that be lesson to you all, I had to recall that the first author had the first  name "Sam" and finally hit upon the search term "sentiment lengthened words" [remembering the "Sam" part is what I'm most proud of, today]:

  Maybe not answer your post directly - but I think you could take a look at the Emojipedia website (
  <link href="https://blog.emojipedia.org/"/>
  https://blog.emojipedia.org/). It is said that you could not make your own emoji.

   You can send this is an image to others, but not as an emoji which is treated like text.
