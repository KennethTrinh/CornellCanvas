  Hi all, A5 grades have been released on CMS.
 </paragraph>

  Here is how to see my comments and explanations of the scores: On the CMS page for the assignment,
  <bold>
   if you don't immediately see the grader feedback
  </bold>
  , click on the red word "show" next to the words "Grading Comments &amp; Requests (show)". This should reveal the text "Grading Comment: Submitted by LJL2" and below it my comments (since I pasted them into CMS text-entry boxes).
