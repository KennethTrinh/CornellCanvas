 Hi all,  you'll have noticed that we're currently using Zoom to enable Cornell Tech students to participate.  So technologically remote live access is clearly available.  If  you aren't a Cornell Tech student and you need to use this option for a given lecture, let me know ahead of time, on a per-lecture basis.

 (This "per-lecture" basis is how I'm currently threading the needle between various considerations and policies.)
