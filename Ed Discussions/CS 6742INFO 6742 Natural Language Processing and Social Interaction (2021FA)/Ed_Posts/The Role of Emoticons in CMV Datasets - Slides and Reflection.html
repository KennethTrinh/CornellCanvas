  quick followup that punctuation usage has been claimed to align with political affiliation:

This study provides evidence that political affiliation is also reflected in features which have been previously overlooked: users{'} discourse patterns (proportion of Tweets that are retweets or replies) and their rate of use of capitalization and punctuation. We find robust differences between politically left- and right-leaning communities with respect to these discourse and sub-lexical features, although they are not enough to train a high-accuracy classifier.",

   Hi Fengyang! I liked the topic and presentation :)
  </p>
  <p>

    What did you find most interesting in that team's project? For instance, what was a cool, or unexpected, or well-done research finding; or, what was a cool, or unexpected, or well-done technique, experimental setup or framing, or other "practical" aspect?

  </p>
  <p>
   Looking at emoticons used in the "edited" section was a nice touch! I wouldn't be surprised if these emoticons follow a different distribution than those used in the main text of a post or in comments, since I presume they're often used as a response to how convincing the commenters are. I was also somewhat surprised by the diversity in emoticon usage--I didn't expect the tail to be so long, since I'm used to just seeing a few.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Imagine that you were added to the other team now. What would you suggest should be the next experiment for your new team to try?
   </b>
  </p>
  <p>
   I think comparing usage rates for different emoticons in posts/sucessful comments/unsuccessful comments would be interesting. By conditioning on emoticon type, you might be able to see more subtle effects (maybe happy vs sad emoticons have a different effect on persuasion, for instance). This might start running into data size issues, however, so it might require gathering a larger sample. I also noticed that emoticons oriented mouth right :) are much more common than mouth left (: I wonder if this handedness matters at all (maybe the less common one is more surprising and so draws more attention).
  </p>
  <p>
   Another nice extension would be to look at unicode emojis as well as text emoticons. You could find a mapping between them and see if they have different effects (if not, merging them could increase your effective sample size).

    I think learning more about how emotes (and other not-purely-grammatically-correct parts of written communication) are used is really interesting! As someone who uses a solid mix of relatively uncommon Unicode emoji on Discord, together with kaomoji and weirdly varying anglosphere-character kaomoji equivalents, it's also really personally relevant haha.
   </p>
   <p>
    I do agree that the CMV dataset is probably too small to focus on emoji: as an occasional casual reader/lurker there, I feel like the subreddit's overall writing style focuses much more on written paragraphs of commentary rather than casual tone. (It totally matches up with what you said about emotes being way more common in OPs' edits on their original posts!)
   </p>
   <p>
    There's a few different ideas I had for studying emoji usage, in addition to what you described in your own future work ideas:
   </p>
   <list style="unordered">
    <li>
     <p>
      I'm curious if investigating Slashdot and any relationship between emoji usage and different types of comment tags would have resulted in more usable data. I'd start with a similar casual exploration and emote recognition process, and then look for any relationship between frequency of different emote types (or groups? for example clustering ":)", ":^)", "(:", "(^:" together into a single smiley face category) and the post/comment labels assigned (or, again, separated into groups - for example "quality", "casual/neutral", "troll/useless")
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      I'm also curious how individual emoji usage relates between commenters and the person/post that they are responding to. Especially if we start ignoring the "delta" part of CMV, I wonder if just examining how likely a commenter is to copy the emoji usage of whoever they're responding to? If the previous poster used an emote/emoji, is a commenter more likely to use the same emote, or any emote at all? Do commenters who respond to each other frequently have higher emote usage similarity?
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      Finally, I'm curious if we could study how emote commonness changes over time. Again, this doesn't depend on things unique to CMV, and could be applied to other discussion-type datasets too. How does the frequency of different emote types change over time, and are there any that seem to affect each other? (For example, I remember Lillian mentioning that older people seem to use ":^)" and now it's more common to see ":)" - did the increase in popularity for two-character smiley cause a decrease in popularity for three-character smiley? Unfortunately, I have no idea how I'd statistically evaluate this but it'd be interesting to do preliminary exploration with at least.

     A1 Reflection:

       One lesson I learned from the project is that more attention should be paid to examples (of posts or conversations) when you have not had a specific research question, or when you are not confident about whether your research topic would work. Majored in statistics before, I always focus on numbers, ratios and tests when I get the data, though unintetionallly. However, sometimes it is more important to know what is really "happening" in the dataset first. And by looking into different examples, you could get a better idea of whether the proposed research question is interesting and whether it will work on the dataset. Of course, more data could be collected later. It just never harms to go through enough examples, as it also helps you shape your research questions and methods better. Moreover, I start thinking about the question of how to allocate your attention and time when you start a pilot study. I spent too much time cleaning the data and trying to have a better pipeline to extract emoticons this time, which for now, I doubt if I should be that detailed. I feel like it is more efficient to focus on the examples and exploring different specific topics, because the goal of pilot study is for assessing the feasibility and for preliminary analysis, but not for providing a final result.
      </p>

       I am most proud of the time when I think about different metrics or tests to prove/disprove the assumption once I have a specific research question. I enjoy the process of considering and envisioning different experiments and results based on the topic before I really start working on it. I believe it is a good way to start with because it helps me format my study and clarify the next steps.

       I spent most of the time cleaning and selecting the data. As mentioned above, I think I should allocate more time for exploring different examples rather than diving into details for the pilot study.
