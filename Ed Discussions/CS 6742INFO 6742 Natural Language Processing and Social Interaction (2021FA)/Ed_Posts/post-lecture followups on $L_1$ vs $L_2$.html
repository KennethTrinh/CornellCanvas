 $L_1$ vs $L_2$ in two dimensions
</heading>
<p>
 <break>
 </break>
 In general, the $L_1$ distance and the $L_2$ distance do {\em not} have a linear relationship. But they do in certain special cases, including the situation that the figure on the handout --- $|V|=2$ --- is situated in. Thus, the $L_2$ distance is omitted in the figure. (It's also true that the $L_1$ and the $L_2$ are the same in one dimension, but, unlike what I misleadingly implied, that's not a reason one could omit $L_2$ from the figure.))

 $L_1$ and $L_2$ distances vs norms (used in regularization)
</heading>

 You can think of the $L_1$ norm for a vector $\overrightarrow{x}$ as the $L_1$ distance between $\overrightarrow{x}$ and the all-zeroes vector, and similarly for the $L_2$ norm.

  Calculations, just for completeness:
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  For $q$, $r$ (proper) distributions over a two-word vocabulary $\{v_1, v_2\}$, we have $q_2 = 1 - q_1$ and $r_2 = 1 - r_2$.
  <break>
  </break>
  So, $q_2 - r_2 = r_1 - q_1$.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, for the $L_1$ distance,
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  $L_1(q, r)  =  |q_1 - r_1| +  |q_2 - r_2|
  <break>
  </break>
  =  |q_1 - r_1| + |r_1 - q_1|
  <break>
  </break>
  =  {2}|q_1 - r_1|.$
 </p>
 <p>
  This turns out to be off by just a constant  to what the $L_2$ distance looks like:
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  $L_2(q, r)  =  \sqrt{(q_1 - r_1)^2 +  (q_2 - r_2)^2}
  <break>
  </break>
  = \sqrt{(q_1 - r_1)^2 +  (r_1 - q_1)^2}
  <break>
  </break>
  =  \sqrt{2}|q_1 - r_1|.$
 </p>
