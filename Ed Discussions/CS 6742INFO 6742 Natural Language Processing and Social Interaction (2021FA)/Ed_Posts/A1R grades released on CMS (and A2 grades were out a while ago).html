 Hi all, A1R grades have just been released on
 <a href="https://cmsx.cs.cornell.edu/">
  CMS
  . And I forgot to announce that the A2 grades were released some time ago (Nov 5)!
 </a>
</p>
<p>
 Here is how to see my comments/explanations of the scores: On the CMS page for the assignment,
 <b>
  if you don't immediately see the grader feedback
 </b>
 , click on the red word "show" next to the words "Grading Comments &amp; Requests (show)". This should reveal the text "Grading Comment: Submitted by LJL2" and below it my comments (since I pasted them into CMS text-entry boxes).

  Note that for A2, the comments on CMS aren't really worth reading, because I figured I had already made all substantive comments here on Ed Discussions.

  But I did put in real comments for A1R (and thank you all for doing such a nice job with it)!
