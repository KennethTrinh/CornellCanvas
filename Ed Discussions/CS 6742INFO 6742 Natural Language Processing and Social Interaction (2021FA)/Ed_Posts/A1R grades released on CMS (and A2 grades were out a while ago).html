  Hi all, A1R grades have just been released on
  <link href="https://cmsx.cs.cornell.edu/"/>
  CMS. And I forgot to announce that the A2 grades were released some time ago (Nov 5)!

  Here is how to see my comments/explanations of the scores: On the CMS page for the assignment,
  <bold>
   if you don't immediately see the grader feedback
  </bold>
  , click on the red word "show" next to the words "Grading Comments &amp; Requests (show)". This should reveal the text "Grading Comment: Submitted by LJL2" and below it my comments (since I pasted them into CMS text-entry boxes).

  Note that for A2, the comments on CMS aren't really worth reading, because I figured I had already made all substantive comments here on Ed Discussions.

  But I did put in real comments for A1R (and thank you all for doing such a nice job with it)!
