 1. I have not received any requests for Zoom access today, so I won't have it "on"; the expectation is that everyone will come to class (modulo sickness, etc., lemme know)
</p>
<p>
 2. I would like everyone to make their first comments (which should be substantive, of course) according to the following assignments (I looked for commonalities among projects to make these assignments, with the rationale given in parentheses).  I am imagining it would take ~30 minutes to do a careful reading, thinking, and commenting.

 Hence, I think at about 1:30 or so, communicate with your commenter for about 15 minutes (either on ed discussions or via vox).
 <break>
 </break>
 <break>
 </break>
 Then, at about 1:45, if you haven't already,  read and leave substantive comments for one other project (or more if you feel like it), your choice, but let's try to spread the commenting around.

  Comment for posterity: we went with talking-interaction for the 15-miinute part, and that seemed to work well enough that we decided to let people talk for as long as they wanted, or to switch to commenting on a second project if they wanted to, but that became optional.
