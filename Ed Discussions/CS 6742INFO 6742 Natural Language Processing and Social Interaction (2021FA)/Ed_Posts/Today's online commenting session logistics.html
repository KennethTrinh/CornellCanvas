  1. I have not received any requests for Zoom access today, so I won't have it "on"; the expectation is that everyone will come to class (modulo sickness, etc., lemme know)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. I would like everyone to make their first comments (which should be substantive, of course) according to the following assignments (I looked for commonalities among projects to make these assignments, with the rationale given in parentheses).  I am imagining it would take ~30 minutes to do a careful reading, thinking, and commenting.
  <break>

  Hence, I think at about 1:30 or so, communicate with your commenter for about 15 minutes (either on ed discussions or via vox).
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  Then, at about 1:45, if you haven't already,  read and leave substantive comments for one other project (or more if you feel like it), your choice, but let's try to spread the commenting around.

   First-commenting assignments:

   </break>
  </bold>
  <break>
  </break>
  Ben: comment on Richard's (both are on scientific communication)
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  Bre: comment on Fede/Roz's (both corpora involve gender(ed) issues)
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  Celine: comment on Khonzoda's (both corpora have distinguished roles, therapist/answerer; client/question asker)
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  Fede: comment on Bre's (both corpora involve gender(ed) issues)
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  Fengyang: comment on Kiran/Linda's (both projects involve persuasion)
  <break>
  </break>

  </break>
  Heather: comment on Remy's (both projects involve how people describe things)
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  Joyce: comment on Khonzoda's (given interest in HCI, and that one could imagine therapist agents; I did have a problem with balancing number of commenters per project, also, I must admit.)

  Comment for posterity: we went with talking-interaction for the 15-miinute part, and that seemed to work well enough that we decided to let people talk for as long as they wanted, or to switch to commenting on a second project if they wanted to, but that became optional.
