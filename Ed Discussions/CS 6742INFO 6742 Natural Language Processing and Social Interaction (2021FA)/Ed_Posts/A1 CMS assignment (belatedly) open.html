  Hi all, I'm still out sick, but just realized I forgot to open an A1 assignment on CMS to allow grouping!  Just did it, I think.  If it doesn't seem to be working, please report this in thread, but I'll also give blanket extensions until Monday when I hope I'll be back up to being able to handle things and it's not a weekend.
