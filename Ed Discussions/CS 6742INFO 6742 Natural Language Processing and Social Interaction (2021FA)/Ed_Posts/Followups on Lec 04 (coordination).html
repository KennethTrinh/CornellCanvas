  The rhetorical reason I brought up the topic-shifting visualization was as an example of a study of topic control as related to power (in this case, interpreted as "dominance", since  technically a debate moderator should have more institutional power within the debate than a debate participant.).  A paper to look at is:

  An excerpt from the intro reads:   "Among many studied behaviors, topic control and management is considered one of the most effective ways to control the conversation (Planalp and Tracy

  1980). Palmer (
  <link href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10994-013-5417-9#ref-CR89"/>
  1989) shows that the less related a participants’ utterances are to the immediate topic, the more dominant they are, and then argues, “

   the ability to change topical focus, especially given strong cultural and social pressure to be relevant, means having enough interpersonal power to take charge of the agenda.

  ” Recent work by Rienks et al. (
  <link href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10994-013-5417-9#ref-CR105"/>
  2006) also shows that topic change, among other structural patterns discussed above, is the most robust feature in detecting influencers in small group meetings."

  A  visualization of the topic-control example I had in mind is slides 13-14 of Philip Resnik's 2014 talk "
  <link href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/LACSS_2014_files/Resnik_LTCSS2014_slides.pdf"/>
  I Want to Talk About, Again, My Record On Energy...” Modeling Agendas and Framing in Political Debates and Other Conversations
  ", covering the paper mentioned above (among other papers.)

  In the slide below, the l_c is showing the model (retrospectively? ) thinking a topic shift has occurred; on the left-hand side bar the columns are (automatically induced)topics, so around line 48 the model has decided that instead of the far-left topic, a different topic is being referred to. The circle around the box that says "energy oil nuclear clean climate cool alternative power" is indicating the keywords most associated with a particular "topic" induced by the model.

  This next slide shows the tendency for each speaker to topic-shift, according to the model.  The grey bars indicate debate moderators/questioners, who one expects to change the topic of the conversation by asking questions on new topics; but Palin is shown to be changing topic as often as one of the moderators (Ifill).

   Re: winning vs losing elections to admin status in Wikipedia: the keywords in the "echoes of power" paper were "admins-to-be" vs "failed-to-be":

  <list style="bullet">
   <li>
    <p>
     during "campaigns" (discussions on "request for adminship" Wikipedia pages), "in the conversations they had on their RfA pages, the admins-to-be were coordinating more to the others than the failed-to-be"

     "Interestingly, the reverse seems to be true for failed-to-be: after failing in their RfAs — an event that arguably reinforces their failure to achieve high status in the community — they coordinate more ( p-value &lt; 0.05; figure omitted due to space limitations)."

    <p>
     [this is really idle speculation on our part] "it is interesting

     to note that the most dramatic change in coordination is visible in

     </break>
     the second month after the change in status occurred. This suggests
     <break>
     </break>
     a period of acclimation to the newly gained status, both for the
