  Please sign up for an individual 20-minute appointment slot with me on October 13th or Oct 14th here:
  <link href="https://6742-2021-appts.youcanbook.me/"/>
  https://6742-2021-appts.youcanbook.me/.  If you can do this in the next day or two, that would be great! (It's Tuesday Oct 5 right now.)

  The confirmation emails you'll receive provide a link to a rescheduling mechanism, so if you can't make any of the open times, please post a reply here (it can be anonymous) indicating which times you're hoping will get freed up, and with luck we'll be able to negotiate a swap.

  If you have any ideas ahead of time (so I have a chance to look things up or see if I can think of anything pre-appointment), you can put that in the 'Notes' field; otherwise, perfectly fine to leave it blank.
