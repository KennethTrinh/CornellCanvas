 1. Reminder that I have office hours every week that can be signed up for:
</p>
<blockquote>
 Go to
 <a href="https://llee-oh-appts.youcanbook.me/">
  my office-hours youcanbook.me page
 </a>
 and read the instructions there carefully. (Yes, while classes are held,
 <i>
  I do have regular office hours!
 </i>
 But I'm using this appointment system rather than drop-in so that everyone gets individual time. I generally have at least two hours every "regular" week, so if you see little or no available time, that probably means other people booked the timeslots first.
 <i>
  Have no fear, the instructions tell you what to do if there aren't available times
 </i>
 .)

 2. I'll make a megathread for optional commitment statements to be posted. The idea is for you,
 <i>
  if you'd find it useful to have a public commitment for yourself
 </i>
 , to write a short "question" where you say, "By day [insert date] I will do [(potentially) short message you understand (but the rest of us don't have to)]".
