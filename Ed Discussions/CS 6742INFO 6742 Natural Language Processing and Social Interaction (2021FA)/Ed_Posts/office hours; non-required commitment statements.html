  1. Reminder that I have office hours every week that can be signed up for:
 </paragraph>
 <blockquote>
  Go to
  <link href="https://llee-oh-appts.youcanbook.me/"/>
  my office-hours youcanbook.me page and read the instructions there carefully. (Yes, while classes are held,
  <italic>
   I do have regular office hours!
  </italic>
  But I'm using this appointment system rather than drop-in so that everyone gets individual time. I generally have at least two hours every "regular" week, so if you see little or no available time, that probably means other people booked the timeslots first.
  <italic>
   Have no fear, the instructions tell you what to do if there aren't available times
  </italic>
  .)
  <break>

  2. I'll make a megathread for optional commitment statements to be posted. The idea is for you,
  <italic>
   if you'd find it useful to have a public commitment for yourself
  </italic>
  , to write a short "question" where you say, "By day [insert date] I will do [(potentially) short message you understand (but the rest of us don't have to)]".
