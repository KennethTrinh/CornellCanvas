  Our initial feasibility test showed that the 2018 dataset may not have the back and forth discussion needed to characterize a buzzy user; however, the r/aita increased in popularity after 2019. To confirm that there are back and forth discussions, I will rerun the feasibility test with the 2019 dataset. Additionally, I will check in with Joyce throughout the week.

  I wasn't able to analyze all the comments from the 2019 dataset (the comments are still being scraped), but I was able to compare the number of comments and the posts for the 2018 and 2019 dataset.

   Fightin' Words Analysis
  </bold>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Joyce and I had a conversation about the community may have changed with an influx of members in 2019. I thought that maybe a fightin' word analysis may tell us how the 2018 community compares with the 2019 community. I took the first 5k posts from 2018 and compared it with the last 5k posts from 2019.

  Fightin words check: were there any words that passed the $\geq$ 1.96 or $\leq$ -1.96 thresholds?  From the y-axis labels, it seems like not.

  I look forward to seeing if there are more buzzy users in the 2019 dataset; seems like there's more potential for that to happen.
