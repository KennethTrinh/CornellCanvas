    It's good to start early on with the data pre-processing, which took the most time. The actual analysis was much faster (even though the plotting did take some time too).

    It was good to have multiple hypotheses because my main hypothesis was nonsignificant in the end. The verbal diversity index, which was measuring a more general concept than adverbs, turned out significant. Thus, even though, my hypothesis in the strict sense was rejected, I found evidence for the more general idea.

    I was proud to have done everything in Python even though I am an R user.

    Pre-processing the dataset, which comes in a user-unfriendly structure. I wish the authors had spent more time making their data more accessible.

  I was a part of my high school’s forensic team, and what I loved about forensics was that debates were won or lost depending on word choice. Because of this, I found the topic of looking at adverbs specifically interesting.

  I’m curious about the role of verbal diversity. The type/token ratio (TTR) is defined as the number of unique words/number of words. How is a unique word defined? We were taught to use an assortment of words in debate but to avoid jargon since that may confuse the audience. The audience is unknown in an online discussion, but I wonder if the same idea still applies. Given the conclusion, the next step would be to explore the effect of a broad vocabulary. The possible procedure could be:

  I think here "unique words" just means "words if you don't count repetitions".  So, the TTR for "the cat the bat the mat" is 4/6: four unique words ("the", "cat", "bat", "mat") divided by six words if repeats are counted.
