     I would say to start early and move quickly.
    </bold>
    We discovered that the generation of research ideas or questions was the least time consuming aspect of the project, while writing the necessary code was the longest. At the same time as you are generating these ideas, start analyzing the data to see if that even makes sense.

     To above point, be able to pivot quickly when needed.
    </bold>
    We began one portion of the project assuming that certain information would be available for both delta and non delta posts, yet we found that was not the case (completely). This mattered because we based success metrics on those assumptions. So we kept some metrics but refocused on other interesting elements of the project that we could find.

     Communicate and delegate tasks early and often with your team (even if the team is just yourself!).
    </bold>
    This is something I most appreciated about the natural organization of my group. I'm not always the most organized person, and particularly this semester, so knowing what to do and by when helps getting to the end goal.

     I'm most proud of the integration of 2 research interests/ideas: topic modelings and semantic analysis.
    </bold>
    It very easily could have been an overly complex idea, but that wasn't the case. Instead, the combination felt very seamless and complimentary.

     I spent most of my time setting up the data for use and on examining the data to quantify our initial metrics.
    </bold>
    I think we were a little surprised about not being able to hit the ground running to examine the data, and that reflects why I mentioned the first point in the lessons learned. In hindsight, and from discussion in class, it seems like we should have gone with the ConvoKit version of the data for ease of use and streamlining the set up. I also worried that we might move too far away from some of the original thoughts about successful posts in our proposal. I knew that if I was really worried then I should take on the task, and so I took steps to create them.

   Lessons learned:

   <paragraph>
    My experience with A1 has taught me first and foremost about the importance of gaining familiarity with the data structure before starting analysis/processing. As we discussed in class, the CMV data had a slightly complicated structure—but when looking through it there was a lot of additional metadata that might have been interesting to explore. In the future, I will try to plan for a day (or at least an hour!) to review the structure of the data, rather than try to alter it immediately.
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    Another lesson learned (or maybe reinforced) was the importance of reading and getting acquainted with whatever text is being studied. I did quite a bit of close reading for this project, based on the output of the topic models. This close reading gave me a much better understanding of the idiosyncrasies of the data, the breadth of what people were discussing, and the ranges in tone/formality that subreddit users were writing with. I also found that doing close reading gave me many more (informed) research questions, as well as a genuine interest in learning more about this community. I recommend using topic modeling as a guide for familiarizing with the dataset more qualitatively!
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    Finally, I learned that analyzing results != writing. Much of the writing of the report occurred at the same time as trying to interpret our results, and I think we could have had a better idea of the big picture of the project with more time to synthesize the results. This was a pilot project, so it wasn’t a huge issue and less feasible—but in the future, I’ll try to do focused analysis/interpretation before writing.

    I’m most proud of how our group merged multiple research ideas and found a balanced level of work for everyone. Especially for a short pilot project, both are difficult to accomplish. Personally, I’m proud of how well I came to know CMV from a lot of close reading, guided by the topic models. This part of the work was really fulfilling, and I think the results—if mostly qualitative and exploratory—from that section are interesting and exciting.

    My role in the development of the project code was data cleaning and merging/cleaning various scripts, and this was accomplished pretty easily. I spent most of my time close reading and writing. The amount of time it took to close read was expected--the point of doing it is that it's a bit slow; when writing, it took more time than expected to make sense of the results. It also took quite a bit of time/focus to figure out how to frame a paper that has two somewhat separate methodological sections.

   What lesson(s) would you like to pass on from your A1 experience?
  </underline>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  There are a few lessons that I would like to pass on from A1 to my future research at large.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The first one is the importance of
  <bold>
   dedicating time and resources into
  </bold>
  <bold>
   conceptualizing the research project
  </bold>
  : from its theoretical foundations, to the research questions, from the methods to the interpretation of the findings. I also think of it as a re-occurring and
  <italic>
   cyclical
  </italic>
  event. The framing of the study should be re-assessed by each member of the research group at each new step in the project. As a matter of fact, my group successfully re-framed the project goals and ideas after hearing Lillian's advice.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  This first point might seem in contradiction with the second takeaway:
  <bold>
   getting started with the
   <italic>
    dirty work
   </italic>
   early in the project is essential for its development
  </bold>
  . With dirty work, I mean the initial stages of the process which often entail performing some type of data processing and cleaning, as well as trying out different metrics and different analyses. Experimenting and getting acquainted with the data early on definitely helps bringing the project onto a solid trajectory, as the awareness achieved in this phase will inform future re-conceptualizations of the project. This is the path my group has taken in this project. After playing with the data, we consolidated some parts of the project and let others go.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Finally, good and
  <bold>
   frequent communication of research ideas and objectives among teammates
  </bold>
  is necessary for the success of a project. It ensures coordination, cooperation and delegation of tasks between members. This came naturally easy in my group as all of us were passionate about the project.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <underline>
   What are you most proud of?
  </underline>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I'm most proud that
  <bold>
   both my computational skills and humanistic perspective
  </bold>
  contributed to the success of our study. In addition, I am still impressed by how quickly I was able to do so, by brainstorming of ideas, writing code to perform LDA and identifying patterns in the topics. NLP research is hard and takes a lot of time! Moreover, I am fascinated by our findings in regards to both the topic models as well as the delta posts metrics.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <underline>
   What did you spend the most time on?
  </underline>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I spent the most time on
  <bold>
   close reading the 25 topics
  </bold>
  in the delta dataset. I got lost in each of the topics that LDA identified, reading post after post, comment after comment. As much as this helped me with understanding the obtained LDA model - and as much as I thoroughly enjoyed it, because human interactions are fascinating -, maybe I could have been more efficient and pragmatic in carrying out this task. At first, I would read 5 random posts from each topic, then realizing that I should have picked the top ones - so I re-started from scratch - and would manually copy and paste the id of the post from the dataframe to the browser bar instead of looking at the posts' titles and bodies directly in the dataframe.

  1. What lesson(s) would you like to pass on from your A1 experience?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Because our pilot study is split into two steps: topic modeling and word feature analysis. It’s very important to check the data we get in each step. For example, if topic assignments "look right" for individual documents and make sure we don’t include replies when generating topic of OP. Otherwise, an error will propagate to the second stage and makes the results less meaningful. Additionally, I am amazed at how many ideas we can build by closely observing the characteristics of the data. Also, I realized the importance of the pilot study. You may have a lot of interesting thoughts related to the data. However, it’s possible that most of them don’t work. The pilot study can test the feasibility of your research and help us avoid investing too much time in the possible wrong direction.

 <paragraph>
  2. What are you most proud of?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I am proud of our team’s work in integrating two ideas together. Also, it’s hard for multiple people to code at the same time in the colab, I think we have a good way to share the code. We have a very detailed analysis of both topic modeling and word-based categorical feature and visualization of the results.
  <break>
  </break>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  3. What did you spend the most time on?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I compared word-based categorical features of delta and non-delta posts and features of persuasive and non-persuasive replies under the same topic. I spent most of my time on the implementation of word-based categorical features of op and replies and also analyzed the result. Also, it took me a while to test different ways to visualize the results to make the conclusion more intuitional.

  Hi Heather, Fede, Roz, and Breanna! I so enjoyed your presentation last Tuesday and reading through your pilot study report. You all did a great job integrating two relevant subjects within the CMV data regarding both exploring discussion topics as well as investigating the associations between word features and persuasiveness. I know from personal experience how hard it can be to sort through the substantive meaning of a given topic from LDA results, so it’s super impressive to see how effectively you were all able to identify relevant themes. I can see the particular diligence you all employed to have qualitative close reading of posts associated with a given topic guide this part of your study. I really liked your interpretation of your findings regarding the nesting of social context within the topics that focused more on general language use as well. I imagine it may have been initially surprising to have found these more abstract topics in your results, but I think your evaluation of how they connect to additional discussion around specific subjects through generalized language is both spot on and very perceptive.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Are you all familiar with Robert, Stewart, and Tingley’s
  <link href="https://www.structuraltopicmodel.com/"/>
  Structural Topic Model (STM) package? I think STM could be an excellent resource to build from these original findings for further research relevant to your interests in how topics differ by given factors such as whether an OP awarded a delta. In case you’re not familiar (and apologies if I’m stating what’s already well known here), STM allows you to incorporate relevant covariates directly into your model enabling you to investigate how these terms vary in their association with a given topic. STM would likely enable you to not have to separate out your dataset for two separate topic model results between delta and non-delta posts. I believe you can even fit interactions across covariates, such as investigating how topic association differs between delta and non-delta posts across the range of scores on your included word category features.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Additionally, STM can identify variations in chosen words by levels of an included covariate within the same topic. An example of this would be examining what words are associated with your topic #10 in your non-delta model regarding US domestic policy depending on whether a comment falls above or below the average value of one of your featured word categories. I wonder if associations such as higher arousal or valence may be more associated with semantically intense words such as
  <italic>
   attack
  </italic>
  and
  <italic>
   war
  </italic>
  , while lower scores may instead be predictive of comparatively benign tokens such as
  <italic>
   support
  </italic>
  and
  <italic>
   right
  </italic>
  ? I think there could be a lot of great avenues that STM could facilitate for further research building from your already strong initial pilot study findings.
