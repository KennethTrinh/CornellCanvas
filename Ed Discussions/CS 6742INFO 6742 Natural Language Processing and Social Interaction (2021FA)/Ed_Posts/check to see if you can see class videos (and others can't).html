  I'd like to check whether: (a) enrolled students can see the class recordings, and (b) non-enrolled students can't.

  Could a few people try accessing the following two links (perhaps with NetID login), and see whether their Cornell friends who aren't in the class are denied even with NetID login?

  OK! I'm now posting lecture recordings to the class website,
  <link href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6742/2021fa/"/>
  https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6742/2021fa/ . (They may take as long as a day to make it up to the site.)
