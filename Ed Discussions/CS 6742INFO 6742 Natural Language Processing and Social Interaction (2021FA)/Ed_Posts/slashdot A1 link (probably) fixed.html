 Hi all, I think I've fixed the Slashdot A1 link.  (At least, I know what was wrong beforehand...I had a relative link that worked on my local machine, and never thought to check that the public version was uploaded.)
</p>
<p>
 (1) Could one or two people check and report back whether download succeeded or failed?
</p>

 feel empowered to post on Ed Discussions about any broken links .... as a corollary to posting anything about the class you'd like to follow up on or just point out!

  I was temporarily able to reproduce the (non-)behavior when clicking on the link (as opposed to directly entering the URL into my browser URL bar), but could not track down the cause. Then I refreshed my browser after doing some other fiddling and now I seem to get the download dialog window.

  Can you try refreshing the A1 page,
  <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6742/2021fa/handouts/a1.html">
   https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6742/2021fa/handouts/a1.html
  </a>
  , in your browser, and then try the Slashdot data link (https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6742/2021fa/handouts/slashdot-subsection-bc3-blog-corpus.zip)?
