  Hi all, I think I've fixed the Slashdot A1 link.  (At least, I know what was wrong beforehand...I had a relative link that worked on my local machine, and never thought to check that the public version was uploaded.)

  (1) Could one or two people check and report back whether download succeeded or failed?

  feel empowered to post on Ed Discussions about any broken links .... as a corollary to posting anything about the class you'd like to follow up on or just point out!

  I was temporarily able to reproduce the (non-)behavior when clicking on the link (as opposed to directly entering the URL into my browser URL bar), but could not track down the cause. Then I refreshed my browser after doing some other fiddling and now I seem to get the download dialog window.

  Can you try refreshing the A1 page,
  <link href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6742/2021fa/handouts/a1.html"/>
  https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6742/2021fa/handouts/a1.html , in your browser, and then try the Slashdot data link (https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6742/2021fa/handouts/slashdot-subsection-bc3-blog-corpus.zip)?
