  Recall from the blackboard (where $C_L$ is some normalization constant with factorials and stuff involving $L$ and the $S_i$'s that you can ignore and I can never remember):
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  C_L\prod_{i} \phi_i^{S_i} + \lambda\left(\sum_k \phi_k - 1\right)
 </math>

  Calculus tells us that if we're trying to find the arg-max, we should "set the derivative to zero and solve for the unknown".
 </paragraph>
 <list style="number">
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    What is the unknown, that is, what variable(s) should we take the derivative with respect to?  (Answer is below)
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    Try solving for the unknown.

    Does using the
    <italic>
     log
    </italic>
    of the lefthand side make things easier? (Hint/motivation: you'll often see papers working with the log )

  (Answer to 1 above: The $\phi$ variables are the unknowns.  I find it easiest, in order to keep all the notation and variables straight, to use, for each
  <italic>
   j
  </italic>
  , :
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  \frac{d}{d\phi_j}
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  That is, use a different variable,
  <italic>
   j
  </italic>
  , than the index variable
  <italic>
   i
  </italic>
  for the product. )
