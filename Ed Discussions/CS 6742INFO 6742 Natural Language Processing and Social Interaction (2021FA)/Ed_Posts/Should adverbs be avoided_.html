 Books on how to write persuasively (e.g., Sword 2012) often note that the use of adverbs should be avoided. Adverbs have a reputation for being weak and causing unnecessary clutter. This is because plenty of adverb-verb combinations are often best expressed with a single, more meaningful verb. For example, "driving fast” could become  “speeding”, "walking slowly" could become "meandering", etc.
</p>
<p>
 I wonder whether such writing tips hold up against data.
</p>
<p>
 To test the hypothesis, I propose to use the CMV dataset and test whether the frequency of adverb use is negatively correlated with persuasiveness.
</p>
<p>
 I found a
 <a href="http://www.esldesk.com/vocabulary/adverbs">
  website
 </a>
 with roughly 4000 adverbs, which I could use to identify adverbs.
</p>
<p>
 This project could be merged into Kiran's or Remy's project as the testing procedure might be fairly similar.

  PROJECT UPDATE:
 </p>
 <p>
  I have managed to read in the CMV data. (I have followed the tutorial on Vlad's blog to do that). I have also web-scraped the list of adverbs.
 </p>
 <p>
  <underline>
   Regarding modeling, my idea is the following:
  </underline>
 </p>
 <p>
  I want to use whether or not a delta has been awarded to the argument as the dependent variable and then use logistic regression with I) relative adverb frequency, II) a verbal diversity index, and III) text length as covariates.

   checkin meeting notes:
  </p>
  <p>
   1. baseline % adverb use in challenger posts?
   <break>
   </break>
   2. concatenate same-user posts in a given thread.
  </p>
  <p>
   3. good to look at modeling the effect of the thread: both with and without, and analyze any discrepancies
   <break>
   </break>
   <break>
   </break>
   4. what is the variance across users of adverb usage rates?
   <break>
   </break>
   example with OP using it a lot, so watch out for quotes:

   We mentioned after lecture but I wanted to put in writing: do be slightly careful to distinguish "doesn't use many adverbs" with just plain old "shorter", if your hypothesis is specifically centered on adverbs.

    I'm curious if this could be generalized to "having a wide range of synonyms v.s. using the same word(s) repeatedly"?

     That's a great point. I will test that too!

      Type-token ratios ("the the the" has three tokens but only one type) are one class of formalization on this idea, although there are several different formulations around; see e.g.
