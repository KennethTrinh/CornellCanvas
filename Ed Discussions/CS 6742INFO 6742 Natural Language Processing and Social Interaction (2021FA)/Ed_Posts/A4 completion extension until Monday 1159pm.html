  Dear all,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Given what happened on Tuesday and the changes this may have caused to everyone's schedule, everyone has an extension on their "follow-through to their commitment statement" until Monday 11:59pm.  (I will update the webpage later.  (Update: the webpage dates have been updated))
