  Hi all, A1 grades have just been released on
  <link href="https://cmsx.cs.cornell.edu/"/>
  CMS.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Here is how to see my comments/explanations of the scores:  On the CMS page for the assignment,
  <bold>
   if you don't immediately see the grader feedback
  </bold>
  , click on the red word "show" next to the words "Grading Comments &amp; Requests (show)".  This should reveal the text "Grading Comment: Submitted by LJL2" and below it my comments (since I pasted them into CMS text-entry boxes).
