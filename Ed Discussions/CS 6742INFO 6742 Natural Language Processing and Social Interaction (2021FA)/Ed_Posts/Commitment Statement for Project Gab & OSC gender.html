  For the next week, I am committed to accomplishing at least these points for my project:
 </paragraph>
 <list style="number">
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    Explore if using the Moral Foundations dictionary is producing the type of information I'm particularly interested in.
   </paragraph>
   <list style="bullet">
    <list-item>
     <paragraph>
      If not, I will need to examine other options - either looking for other lexicons/dictionaries or using different methods.
     </paragraph>
    </list-item>
   </list>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    I will produce general statistics about OSC users and a random sample of none OSC users.
   </paragraph>
   <list style="bullet">
    <list-item>
     <paragraph>
      This will include information about things such as:
      <bold>
       Do OSC female post more (or less/no difference) on average than OSC males? And compared to the random sampled control group. Are there users who post frequently versus infrequently?
      </bold>
     </paragraph>
    </list-item>
   </list>
  </list-item>
 </list>
 <paragraph>
  I will likely add more to this post by tomorrow but I wanted to write my notes as they stand right now.

  Unfortunately, I spent a vast amount of time just trying to work with the data file! This weekend I was finally able to figure it out and had a chance to get a better picture of my data. In that time, I chose to inspect and clean that text. I noticed that there aren't any reply posts to original posts as I had originally guessed. This will impact my methods, though I might use other interaction metrics such as like counts and total reply counts.

  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  Overall, I gathered approx. 537,000 posts from OSC_female users, and after processing and cleaning the text I have about 500,000 posts generated from  about 1,500 unique users. A random sample of Non_OSC users (about 1,300) for which I will compare generated approx. 130,000 posts after processing and cleaning.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I used the LIWC software to generate both Moral Foundations scores and various LIWC sentiment and descriptive scores, however I haven't yet compared between OSC_female and the random control group.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Moving forward and now that I have the data in hand, I can focus on general analysis. I hope to have figures, descriptive information by Wednesday and I plan to start writing a draft by Friday.

  Do you think you might want to non-randomly sample for users that get a bunch of replies (Both OSC_female and the other group)?  I'm actually not sure about this; I could see either focusing on posts with high reply rates or investigating the rate of reply as affected by the OSC_femaleness of the original poster. I guess for this class, which is about language, one should perhaps do the former (look at cases where there are language replies to analyze).
