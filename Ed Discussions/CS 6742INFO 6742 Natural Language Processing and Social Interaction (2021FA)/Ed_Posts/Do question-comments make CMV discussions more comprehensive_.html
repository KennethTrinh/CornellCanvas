  Excerpts from “Attacked from within” made me think of the value of different kinds of replies and contributions to the overall conversation. Thus, when exploring discussions on ChangeMyView subreddit, I tried to look at comments through the lens of low vs high value criteria suggested by anaesthetica.
  <break>
  </break>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Something that caught my interest are question-comments. These replies are often short and primarily made of questions. Given how short they are, such comments would probably be assessed as having a “low value”. Furthermore, according to
  <link href="https://chenhaot.com/pubs/winning-arguments.pdf"/>
  Tan et al. it seems that comments with a high ratio of questions do not earn many deltas. At the same time, if we consider their contribution to the overall conversation, question-comments often enlighten flaws in their parent-comment’s argument, which could lead to a more fruitful and well-rounded discussion. For conversations with the goal of changing someone’s opinion, I think it is very important to cover and discuss as many aspects of the issue as possible. This especially applies in the context of online platforms where even archived conversations are easily accessible to any interested internet user.

 <paragraph>
  In this project I am interested in seeing whether question-comments help the conversation to branch out and cover new aspect/facet of the problems. To do so I will first try to identify question-comments by looking at the ratio of sentences that are questions. To check whether such comments open a new direction in the conversation I think of using word/sentence -level entropy, or how surprising a word/sentence is in the context of the discussion. The context would be defined based on the temporal conversation tree structure: 1) comments that appear in the path from the root to the given comment and 2) all comments in the discussion that were posted before the given comment.

  There are already several limitations of the method that I foresee:
 </paragraph>
 <list style="unordered">
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    Unexpected comments are not necessarily relevant to the conversation. These could be tangential topics which instead of broadening the discussion divert it away from important topics.
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    Unexpected question-comments could also indicate trolling or hostile behavior. However, for the purposes of this project I am going to assume that trolling is regulated and taken care of by the moderators.
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    Unusual phrasing does not mean that this user is opening a new topic in the discussion.
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    Similarly, to cover a new aspect of the problem, one does not necessarily have to use new vocabulary. In fact in the light of language coordination discussion we had in class, I wonder if some users would be incentivized to use the same lexicon as the OP in order to be more understandable and convincing?

  I believe my comment last night was just on references to the role of questions in discussions, and luckily I seem to have the relevant browser tabs still open!

  I have loaded the CMV data and processed the sentences. For a while I have been getting very few question-comments. However, I figured out that this was due to my mistake in the sentence splitting procedure. Currently, I was able to identify almost 12k utterances (out of almost 300,000 in the dataset) which are
  <italic>
   fully
  </italic>
  made of questions (defined as a sentence which ends with a "?") . They come from 2453 unique discussions. While inspecting resulting utterances I found two peculiar kinds:
 </paragraph>
 <list style="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    Many (more than 8k) of these 11k utterances are just 1-question comments, which could also be a couple of words long (e.g. "Why?", "Arizona?") . In order to reduce potential noise, I think of excluding 1-question comments that are shorter than 7 words. While questions that request for  elaboration are interesting, I am not sure to what extend they help the conversation change the direction.
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    Some of these question comments are made of many question sentences (at times more than 10). I realized that in certain cases author use "?" to separate items in the list, such as here: "Do you like the Harry Potter books?  Jim Carrey?  Halle Barry?  Hillary Swank?  Kurt Cobain?  Jim Morrison? [...]"
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
 </list>
 <paragraph>
  With question-comments identified, I am currently trying to formalize an appropriate comparison group to make judgements on entropy differences in subsequent comments after the question-comment. Given a large number of potential confounding factors it would be best to consider the same conversations. I originally imagined comparing surprisal from question
  <bold>
   A
  </bold>
  to the averaged surprisal from each of the previous comments. However, perhaps it would be better to compare it to surprisal from each of the earlier replies to
  <bold>
   A
  </bold>
  's parent comment.

  Maybe for each question, look for some comment that is very similar but not a question.  Most likely will be in some other conversation tree, BUT should (hopefully) be somewhat in topic.  Good idea to try to have OPs be similar, too --- but for pilot study, just report how often it was the case.

  very short question could be discarded; but they also look interesting, so could be handled be separately or as a different case.  They seem mean but pointed ("killer argument" types?)

  For a comment, if you have the ID, if you go to the original post URL, you can take the comment ID, example, comment id for cnhl93a can be seen here:

  So maybe short questions vs longer questions?

  What's the value of sequences of questions?
