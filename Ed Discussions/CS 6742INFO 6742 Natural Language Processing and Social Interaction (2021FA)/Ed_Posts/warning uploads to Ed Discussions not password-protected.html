 Just noticed that files to uploaded Ed Discussions materials are not password-protected; e.g., I can access
 <a href="https://static.us.edusercontent.com/files/AoUWggt6dqb7frRpgnCFKLaC">
  https://static.us.edusercontent.com/files/AoUWggt6dqb7frRpgnCFKLaC
 </a>
 which is a figure by Fede and Roz from a browser that is not signed in to Ed Discussions.
