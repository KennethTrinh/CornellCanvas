  Are people more open to changing their minds when discussing certain topics over others, regardless of how people frame their responding arguments? Our proposed project seeks to examine whether users are more open minded concerning certain subject matters on the asynchronous, discussion-based forum, Reddit. We plan to analyze conversations within the Sub-Reddit ‘r/ChangeMyView’ (CMV) dataset to identify topics across the collection of original posts that tend to correlate more with the original poster’s change of mind.
  <break>
  </break>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  By studying subjects aligned with increased open mindedness, we can add useful context to Tan et al.’s (2016) findings about conversational structure and successful persuasion. If there is high correlation between subject matter and the original poster’s (OP) change of mind, then this has implications about the constructiveness of online, asynchronous, pseudonymous spaces. Our project also responds to Hovy and Yang’s (2021) critiques about the excessive focus of natural language processing on language content, and lack of attention to social factors. By focusing on “topics” we study less how specific types of language practices are more persuasive (e.g. hedging or evidence) and more about how people may just not be as open to changing their minds pertaining to certain topics, whether due to their cultural and ideological background (history, politics, moral baggage) or various unobserved and understudied factors.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <break>
  </break>
  We acknowledge the context of the interactions on Reddit might be a complicating factor to our project, given that conversations on CMV are asynchronous, remote and multi-participant. This context, combined with the use of pseudonyms on the platform, also affects the social relation between speaker and receiver. By partially concealing the identity of those engaged in the interaction, those involved in the conversation regard each other as strangers. As a result, OPs might be more or less inclined to change their mind. Additionally, we consider the self-selection of OPs who participate in CMV as individuals who may truly be seeking external input. People seeking the space to share their convictions and opinions with the explicit purpose of “changing their minds” provides us a rich, interactive environment for which we attempt to answer our research questions.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Methodologically, we plan to implement this project using topic modeling to identify those topics in our collection of CMV posts that correlate with a change of mind in the OPs’ ideas. After topic modeling all root posts, we will compare each topic to its relative number of deltas, with weighted adjustments for more or less common topics overall. We will also compare this to the number of users, comments, and which topics generate increased conversation. We operationalize topic open-mindedness using four metrics: 1. Full success signified - whether the OP gives a delta at all, 2. Quickness - measured by the time-elapsed between OP post and OP delta provided, or overall first delta given if OP does not indicate one, 3. Conference size - the numbers of unique commenters who joined the conversation to change the OP’s mind, and 4. Coverage - the number of comments needed for a delta to be provided from the OP only, or total number overall if no delta given. Finally, depending on how many posts are written by unique OPs, we may also consider whether open mindedness is consistent for individual users across topics.

  Hi Roz, I am also very interested in topic modeling, do you think we can work together on this? Besides the features you mentioned, I am also thinking about the word preference of different topics.  I can also work on a separate project. What do you think of that?

  Hi Heather! We would love to have you join our group if you'd like!

  Also, from there if you think you'd like to take it a different direction but want to at least start out collaborating, that also works. Whatever you you'd like. Let me know so I can add you as a member on CMS!

  Glad to have you joining the group, Heather! Is there a good way to contact you so we can start discussing the project more? Our group has been communicating through Slack so far, but we can change it up.

  An alternative methodology to consider, as a first pass to see whether there are topic differences in changed-mind vs non-changed-mind posts at all:
  <break>
  </break>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Instead of topic-modeling all posts at once to get "all topics in the data", one trained one model on the mind-changed posts. Then, compare how well the trained model does on distinguishing held-out (i.e., not in the training data) mind-changed posts from same-length mind-not-changed posts?  "Distinguishing" could mean seeing if the probabilities assigned by the trained model to the two different types of not-seen-before text are different to a statistically significant degree.

  Project update:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  With the merging of teams, we've decided to also merge the project concepts. We'll begin by finding the correlation between topics and deltas, and then analyze language associated with the topics. Our team has met and developed a plan for how to complete the project before Monday. We outlined three main steps:
 </paragraph>
 <list style="number">
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    Data import and processing
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    Topic modeling and comparing to deltas
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    Feature exploration: what type of language is associated with different topics?
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
 </list>
 <paragraph>
  So far, we've gotten about halfway through this plan. We've successfully imported/cleaned data and trained topic models. This pipeline is set up, but we'll need to re-run and add a lemmatization stage. We also would like to discuss training separate topic models on delta and non-delta posts (as your comment recommended). Regardless, the training of topic models shouldn't be a roadblock for our project.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Our main issue is that we're having trouble identifying which field holds the delta value. We also need a little bit of help with designing the next few stages of our task and whether to separate delta text from non-delta text.

  1. check whether is just posts, not including the comments?

  2. sanity checking of whether topic assignments "look right" for individual documents.

 <paragraph>
  3. extra bonus question: is there a diff for OPs that are strongly correlated with multiple topics, vs those that are very single-topic.

  4. CMV runs contests: like "fresh topic fridays", maybe could use this as well?
