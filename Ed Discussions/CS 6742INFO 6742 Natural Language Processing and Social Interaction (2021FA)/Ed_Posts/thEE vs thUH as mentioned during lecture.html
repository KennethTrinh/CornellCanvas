 Professor mentioned a body of research that finds that pronunciation of "the" as "thEE" or "thUH" suggests how much effort the speaker needs to put into articulating what they would like to say next.

 I think that this article may be what she was referring to, if anybody else was also curious to see more about it!

 Pronouncing ‘‘the’’ as ‘‘thee’’ to signal problems in speaking (Fox Tree and Clark, 1997)

<blockquote>
 In spontaneous speaking,
 <i>
  the
 </i>
 is normally pronounced as
 <i>
  thuh
 </i>
 , with the reduced vowel schwa (rhyming with the first syllable of
 <i>
  about
 </i>
 ). But it is sometimes pronounced as
 <i>
  thiy
 </i>
 , with a nonreduced vowel (rhyming with
 <i>
  see
 </i>
 ). In a large corpus of spontaneous English conversation, speakers were found to use
 <i>
  thiy
 </i>
 to signal an immediate suspension of speech to deal with a problem in production. Fully 81% of the instances of
 <i>
  thiy
 </i>
 in the corpus were followed by a suspension of speech, whereas only 7% of a matched sample of
 <i>
  thuh
 </i>
 s were followed by such suspensions. The problems people dealt with after
 <i>
  thiy
 </i>
 were at many levels of production, including articulation, word retrieval, and choice of message, but most were in the following nominal.

  yes, and good find!  (It's not easy to google "the" meaningfully, I guess.)  Here's a little Language Log followup:

  But can hearers use such subtle indications? Jennifer Arnold, Maria Fagnano, and Michael Tanenhaus later provided evidence that hearers are quite sensitive to this sort of signalling (
  <i>
   Disfluencies Signal Theee, Um, New Information

  , Journal of Psycholinguistic Research, Vol. 32, No. 1, January 2003).

  When hearers looking at the picture ... (and wearing eye-tracking devices) are asked e.g. to
  <i>
   put theee uhh camel below the salt shaker
  </i>
  , the
  <i>
   theee uhh
  </i>
  (as opposed to simple
  <i>
   thuh
  </i>
  ) leads them to move their eyes to previously unmentioned objects. Presumably, this strategy is based on an assumption that the speaker is more likely to have processing difficulty when saying something new than when talking about something previously mentioned. So we can use a signal of processing difficulty to help us predict the meaning of an as yet unsaid word. Who'da thought?
