 As mentioned in Hovy et al. (2021), text or response generation may need to adaptively adjust to the social context. Since CMV data has the same language, domain, and occasion, I am very interested in exploring how topics will influence both tasks. From the future discussion session of Tan et al. (2016), authors tried to use topic models to determine which topic is the most malleable one. Although that feature doesn’t improve prediction accuracy when directly incorporated into the model. I believe that the topic information is still useful somehow.
</p>
<p>
 For topics ranging from politics to life conversations, I think its corresponding posts and comments will have different word preferences. For example, maybe political posts will be more easily convinced by comments with concrete words. And life topics with high intensity of emotion will be more resistant to change. We can apply the word category-based features with the topic. After determining the topic of the OP, I’d like to test if it works to train a separate classifier of each different topic.
</p>
<p>
 Using separate classifiers highly depends on how the topic is divided, and it is possible that some topics have very limited training samples. Other than that, we can explore other ways to incorporate topic information. For example, we can look at the most similar post on the same topic as a historical reference when predicting if a new post is malleable.

  Is there a possibility of partnership/interchange with (alphabetically) Bre, Fede, and Roz,

   Hi Lillian, Thanks for your advice. I carefully read Bre, Fede, and Roz's post. I think we both use the topics model but not the same in detail. Also, I am considering if four people in a group would be too many?

    If you're happy with a group size, I'm happy with a group size!  I see you have grouped on CMS.
