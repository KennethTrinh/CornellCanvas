 In "Winning arguments..." (Tan et al., 2016), there is discussion about the relationship between back-and-forth exchange length and delta percentage, as well as the findings that OP and comment text similarity (vocabulary and stopword similarity) correlated with argument success rate. However, for an argument to be successful at all, the OP must read and respond to it to begin with. I'm curious whether the probability of OP responding to a comment correlates with the number of previously given deltas, vocabulary similarity, stopword similarity, pronoun use, or comment length / depth.
</p>
<p>
 Especially in larger forum spaces like CMV, there may be too many comments for OP to properly read and respond to. Furthermore, because it's an online discussion space, OP could miss or skip handling certain responses. Lastly, because OP's opinion could already be changed, I'm curious what might make them stick around for further discussion instead of leaving the thread abandoned altogether.
</p>
<p>
 To do this, I would start by looking at the interaction between each comment's vocabulary similarity, stopword similarity, pronoun usage, and previous delta count and relate that to whether or not OP has responded to the comment.
</p>
<p>
 I think I'm missing out on some other factors to control for here, and would also appreciate more general thoughts / advice!

  One challenge with respect to the proposal --- although an amazing fact about CMV --- is that the rules are that the OP must be actively engaged with challengers:  here is "Rule E", and a post "will be removed by a moderator (or
  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/AutoModerator">
   /u/AutoModerator
   ) if it violates one or more of our published posting rules:".
   <break>

   Rule E (

  CMV is about conversation between people who believe different things. The Original Poster (OP) needs to be available to answer questions, provide clarification, evaluate arguments and provide responses as part of a back-and-forth between them and the people in the discussion. If someone takes the time to respond to your post, it is only fair that you be there to read it and respond yourself.

      This gives plenty of time for responders to see the thread and start engaging with OP. Without a doubt there should be at least a few users in the thread. If we wait any longer, then new users who see it and comment will be wasting their time responding to an OP who isn't there.

     <blockquote>
      On the off chance that nobody responds to OP (really, really rare), we will be lenient on the timeframe because obviously OP needs someone to respond to for it to be a conversation. Similarly, if you only receive a few low-effort responses (e.g. "You spelled X wrong" or "It was actually 1990, not 1991") within 3 hours after posting, we won't hold it against you for not responding.
     </blockquote>

     <blockquote>
      If you become available to respond after your post has been removed, it can be reinstated by messaging the moderators. You should only make this request if you can participate within three hours of the reapproval request. Sometimes, it is more beneficial to create a new thread, especially if the original had low participation and a considerable amount of time has passed.

      A small number of one line responses that don't address the arguments that people are making will still result in removal.

    <li>
     <blockquote>
      Additionally, OPs who exclusively respond to people agreeing with them doesn't really count as conversation. You need to actually engage with people who are countering your argument, not look for people who agree with you and bolster your own. Furthermore, frivolous responses (e.g. saying "it's all good" in response to all comments) are not a "conversation".
     </blockquote>

 <p>
  So, one will need to formulate a measure of response that characterizes a low level of response that would still pass the "Rule E" threshold.
