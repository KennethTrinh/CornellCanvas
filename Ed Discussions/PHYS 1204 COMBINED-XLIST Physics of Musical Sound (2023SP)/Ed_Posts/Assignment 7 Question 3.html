  The given information says the fourth wall is 4.3m long, but the wall that seems to be parallel to it has a length of 4.4m. Is this a typo or should we account for the fact that the room is not perfectly rectangular?

  Good catch. It was meant to be 4.4 m, not 4.3 m.  But real rooms in old buildings are often out of whack.  You could calculate both ways and see if it makes a difference.
