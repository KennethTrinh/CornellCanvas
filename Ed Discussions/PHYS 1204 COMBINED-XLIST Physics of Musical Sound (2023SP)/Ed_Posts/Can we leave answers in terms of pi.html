 Can we leave answers or axis scales in terms of pi, or do we need to multiply it out fully so we're left with only numbers?

  Hi Nicolaas,
 </p>
 <p>
  To help minimize calculation errors and maximize understanding, we like to do the following:
 </p>
 <p>
  1. First, write out your answer with symbols / in equation form, without putting in numbers.
 </p>
 <p>
  2. Second, write it out again with all the numbers - with units/dimensions - included.
 </p>
 <p>
  3. Finally, give the final numeric answer with units, using an appropriate number of significant figures and powers of 10/scientific notation or standard unit prefixes (k=kilo, M=mega, m = milli, etc), using standard units (MKS in most cases in this course.)
 </p>
 <p>
  4.  Check that the units of the result match the units of the quantity to be found.
 </p>
 <p>
  5.  Check that the numeric answer is physically reasonable.
 </p>
 <p>
  Scientists and engineers generally go through all these steps. If you cut any step out, you're more likely to miss any errors.
 </p>
 <p>
  This can seem a bit arduous at first, but it eventually becomes automatic through practice.
 </p>
 <p>
  Best wishes,
 </p>
 <p>
  Prof. Thorne
