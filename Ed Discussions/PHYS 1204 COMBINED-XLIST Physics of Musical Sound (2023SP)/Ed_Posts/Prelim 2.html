 On the Prelim 2 key ideas, it says we have to know "ways to construct musical scales", will we have to know any specific numbers/ratios or just the concepts of the scales and when they do/don't work?

  Just the concepts of the scales and how they're constructed / what the goal is in constructing the note frequencies, their important differences, and when they do/don't work.
