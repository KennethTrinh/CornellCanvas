 "I wanted to ask about some of the content on the transition from cylindrical to conical bores. How well should we know the "math-y"-looking stuff, like the (p^2)(pi r^2) equation with the tan angle? Or the flute equation with sin in it? Or should we just know the general idea of what's going on with the waves and harmonics? Furthermore, is it important to the fingering of the clarinet, what notes they make, and how they correspond to specific harmonics (referencing the photo attached)?"
</p>
<p>
 Equation for standing waves in flute: Yes. Just a sine wave.
</p>
<p>
 Equation for waves in conical bores: No. (I don't think it's on the formula sheet, is it?)
</p>
<p>
 Be able to sketch the standing waves in conical bores, and label their n and frequencies? Yes.
</p>
<p>
 Fingering of clarinet? Only if you're a clarinet player.
</p>
<p>
 Relation between open tone hole position, vibrating length, and fundamental frequency - yes.
</p>
<p>
 Idea of registers, relation between fundamental and harmonic frequencies in each register - yes.
