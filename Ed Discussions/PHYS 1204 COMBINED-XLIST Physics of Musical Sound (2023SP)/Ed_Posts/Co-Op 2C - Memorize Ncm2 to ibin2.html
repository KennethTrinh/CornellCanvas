  Hi-
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For the second part of this problem, where we're asked to convert to ib/in^2, which does not seem to have a decadic / simple / easily memorizable conversion, to get this question on the quiz, should we memorize this conversion factor?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thanks

  You should be able to do unit conversions on quizzes and exams.  But we don't expect you to remember conversion factors between lbs and N, or between inches and cm,  meters and miles, etc. Those will be given, but you'll still have to apply them correctly. So practice conversions.
