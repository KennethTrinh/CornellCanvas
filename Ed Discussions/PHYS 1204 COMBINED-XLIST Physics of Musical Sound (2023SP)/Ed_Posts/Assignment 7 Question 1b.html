 Question 1b asks to estimate the lowest beat frequency that occurs between notes C2 and G3, but the context of the question suggests that G2 is meant instead of G3? Which one is the case?

  Another typo. Yes, it should be G2.    The numbering 2-3, 3-4 turns over at C, and G is below C so it should be in the same number.
