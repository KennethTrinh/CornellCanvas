  Are we provided any materials other than the plywood and whatever's in our kit to make the jack in the box?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  At the very minimum, we will need a way to make reasonably-sturdy boxes; given that everything must be laser-cut, I'd imagine that we'll need wood glue or nuts and bolts (of a known size) to use the website shown in lecture. Is there a place we should get these from, or should we procure these ourselves?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I also am thinking about the case where we may need more than what's in our kits in terms of quantity (i.e. 3 servos) - what should we do if that happens?

  We are will provide the bolts and nuts described in class. We should have a large supply in Rhodes 114 tomorrow.

  With respect to adding more hardware than available in your kit, that is OK (either by borrowing parts from others or using non-attributed parts in Rhodes 114 (i.e. parts in the grey bins). That being said, this assignment is not about absolute complexity, but how to best use the capability of a laser cutter.
