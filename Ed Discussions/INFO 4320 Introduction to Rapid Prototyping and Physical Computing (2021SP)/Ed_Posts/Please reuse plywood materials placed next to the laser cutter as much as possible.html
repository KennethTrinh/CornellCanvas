  Hi all,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  We sorted and placed the used plywood materials next to the laser cutter so that it's easier to find reusable plywood materials. Please use these used ones as much as possible especially when you're cutting small pieces. This way, we can avoid using too many plywood materials more than necessary.
