    What about students who will be located in Ithaca, but after the start of classes. For example, I'm returning to Ithaca on February 15th.

      It should be OK, but note that starting next class we will be starting in-class projects and the corresponding assignment will be due the Friday after class. Both require a kit we will distribute this week.
