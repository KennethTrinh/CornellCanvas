  Hi Everyone,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  This semester has been challenging for everyone in multiple aspects. In order to alleviate the pressure you have on the shoulder, Francois and I have decided to make the following changes to the upcoming deadlines and grading policy:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1. The deadline for submitting your team project report on the first prototype has been extended to next Friday ( 23:59, Apr 23). This was originally due next Monday. We hope this can help you to get more time to work on your hardware prototype, which is still due next Monday.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. We will automatically drop
  <bold>
   ONE
  </bold>
  mini-project in which you received the lowest grade when we calculate the final grades.  This means that you can skip one mini-project without hurting your final grade if all your other mini-projects receive satisfactory grades.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  We hope this would give you more flexibility when prioritizing your tasks. Please feel free to contact Francois or me if you have any questions or there is anything that we can help with.
