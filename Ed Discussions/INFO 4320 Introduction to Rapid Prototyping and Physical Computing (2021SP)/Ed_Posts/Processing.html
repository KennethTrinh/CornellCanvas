  How do we get the processing application to display the data the LIDAR program is sending? I changed the name of the port to the one my arduino is using but I keep getting "port busy" when I run the processing program.

  Try closing your arduino serial message window. I believe it locks Processsing out of the serial port. I had this issue too

  The port can only be used by one program. It is likely that you have the serial monitor running which has already used the port.

  When you run the processing program, you need to close the serial monitor
