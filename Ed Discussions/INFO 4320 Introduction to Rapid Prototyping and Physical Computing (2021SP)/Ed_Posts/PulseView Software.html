 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 PulseView cannot be opened on my computer. I can download it, but when I run it, this error pops up. I have a Mac with Big Sur.

  I installed the original release instead (0.4.2) and that worked. The Nightly Builds one does not work with Big Sur.

   Yeah, computers are afraid of nightly builds - because the files are so new to the Internet, they aren't recognized as safe-to-run. Windows says "Windows protected your pc" for the nightly builds, and I imagine that this is Mac's version of that message.
