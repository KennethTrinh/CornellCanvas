  Our team is having trouble figuring out how to reverse the direction of the DC motor.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  We are using 10 motors for our system so we want to find a simple way to reverse the direction possibly by changing code (ex. using for loop or changing a status).
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If this is not feasible, please let us know any other simplest ways to reverse a DC motor.

  Thanks!

  The circuit to do this was presented in the April 12 lecture (

  Bidirectional Motor Control). Each chip can control the direction and speed of 2 motors independently.

  We have many spare motors if you are having a problem with the wiring as shown in the picture above.

  If you only need one direction of movement, one way you can do this it to simply reverse the motor's polarity by swap the positive and negative ends.
