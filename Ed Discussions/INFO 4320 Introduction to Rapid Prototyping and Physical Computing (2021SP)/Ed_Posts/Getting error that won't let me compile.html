  A simple solution I do is to unplug your board and plug it back in .  If it still does not work, restart your computer and see how it works.

  I have had this error before. Doing a fresh install of Arduino helped me to fix it.

  Let us know how it works. If this problem still exists, you may need to get a new board. You can send us emails on this and we can coordinate the pick up.

  If you have not tried this, you can also try to connect to a different USB port on your computer.
