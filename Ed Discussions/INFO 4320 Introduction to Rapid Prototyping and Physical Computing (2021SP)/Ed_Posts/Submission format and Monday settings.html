 We got a few questions on the format of this week's mini-project submission as well as the setting for next Monday. Here are the answers to them:
</p>
<p>
 1. Mini-project submission this week: Please submit the original project file (f3D) and the screenshots of your design on Canvas.  The TA will take a look at the screenshot and open your original model design for grading.
</p>
<p>
 2. Monday class setting: Each team needs to have one student demonstrate the cardboard prototype live in class. That means you need to move the cardboard to one student's home before Monday's class.  Videos, figures, and slides are not required. If they think they can help you present your project, you are welcome to use them in addition to the live demo of the cardboard prototype.
</p>
<p>
 Please let us know if you have follow-up questions.

  Is it okay if there are other sketches in the file (like the house) or should our project file only have the envelope and duck?

   It should only have the envelope and duck.
  </p>
  <p>
   But if you have submitted your assignment, and have the house practice in it, it should be fine.
