 Hello,
 <break>
 </break>
 And welcome to INFO 4320 Spring 2021!
 <break>
 </break>
 <break>
 </break>
 Our first lecture is tomorrow, and because INFO 4320 is online this semester we would like you to perform the following steps before class tomorrow:
</p>
<list style="bullet">
 <li>
  <p>
   We will use Zoom as our primary lecture tool. The
   <a href="https://applications.zoom.us/lti/rich/home/meeting/detail">
    zoom classroom
    can be accessed from Canvas;
   </a>
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   We will complement Zoom with Discord for the hand-on parts of the class; Please be sure to register to the
   <link href="https://discord.gg/EC88dbqr"/>
   class server before the beginning of the class;
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   We will also use Miro as an idea and drawing sharing tool. I just sent all of you an invitation to the class team. Please be sure to sign for the tool before class or let us know if you did not receive an invitation;
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   As you know we are also planning to conduct a Marshmallow challenge during the class. Please be sure to
   <link href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/4325/discussion/239504"/>
   pick our hardware kit
   before class if at all possible and have a
   <b>
    pair of scissors
   </b>
   and a
   <b>
    ruler
   </b>
   handy if you own one (there is no need to buy anything);
  </p>
 </li>
</list>
<p>
 Finally I wanted to reminder you that we will discussed the enrollment process tomorrow, but do not hesitate to contact us if you have any other questions!

 Looking forward to meet you all tomorrow!
