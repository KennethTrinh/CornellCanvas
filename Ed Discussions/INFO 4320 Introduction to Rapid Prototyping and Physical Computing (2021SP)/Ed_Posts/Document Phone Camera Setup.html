  This setup is important for the teaching team to know what is happening on your hardware prototype or circuits and help you fix problems during the classes as well as office hours. We assume here that you use your laptop as a main screen and your phone as a document camera. Alternatively, you can also join the Zoom meetings from your phone, if you prefer that way or any of the methods doesnâ€™t work for you.

  If you are using a Mac, Zoom will let you use an iPhone connected to your Mac as a document camera. Let us know if this is an option for you.
