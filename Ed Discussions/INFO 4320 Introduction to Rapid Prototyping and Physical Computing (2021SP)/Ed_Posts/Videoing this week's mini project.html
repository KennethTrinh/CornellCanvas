 For the video, should we be in the frame while we move the object closer and farther from the range finder? (I'm having trouble keeping the movement in frame.) Or should the video be a close up of the board so that you can see the LED brightness changes?

  We want to see both actually.  The movement and LED brightness.   Also, we want to see the output from the serial monitor.

  One way to do this is to set the camera up instead of holding on to the hand, which would make things easier.

  If capturing them all in frame is impossible, you can capture different parts separately. E.g., serial monitor -&gt; LED brightness change,  -&gt; movement.
