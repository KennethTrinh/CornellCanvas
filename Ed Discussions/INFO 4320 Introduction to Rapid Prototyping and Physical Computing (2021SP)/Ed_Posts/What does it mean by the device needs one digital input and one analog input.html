 Does this mean that the device must use digitalRead() and analogRead()?
</p>
<p>
 I used a sensor that just got information from it and used that to manipulate the LED lights, but didn't use digitalRead or analogRead. Does that work as having an input?

  From your description I do not think this will work as your project must include programming and use digitalRead and analogRead.
