  Hello,

  We don't see any more plywood in Rhodes 114 -- is it possible to order more?

  We have ordered more plywood.

  Could you tell us if you are referring to your initial allotment, or because you need more besides that?

  We order new material last week, and they should arrive soon, but in the meantime, I will encourage you to test your design with cardboard and/or use leftover material you will find next to the laser cutter.
