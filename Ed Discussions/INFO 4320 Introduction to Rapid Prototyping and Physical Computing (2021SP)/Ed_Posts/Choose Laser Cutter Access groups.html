  Can you please explain how this spreadsheet is structured? I'm very confused. Are we supposed to signup for both a weekday and weekend option? DO we need to go everyday? Do we only go once a week?

  Sure.

  As we discussed in Monday's class, each student needs to choose one group for workday and one group for weekends.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1. Workday Access: You can only access the laser cutter on the day that in your chosen group.  Each student will only be able to access the laser cutter one day per week in the following weeks. The concrete dates are depending on the chosen group.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. Weekend Access: If you want to use the laser cutter on one of the weekends of your choice.
 </paragraph>

  Please let us know if you still have questions about this. We created this form to avoid Rhodes 114 being overcrowded before deadlines.
