 Hello,
 <break>
 </break>
 As part of the inquiry about the fire early Monday morning, I wanted to remind people about key aspects of laser safety:
</p>
<list style="bullet">
 <li>
  <p>
   First and foremost, you should always have the laser in your field of view when it is on. It is not OK to be on the other side of the room, and it is certainly
   <b>
    unacceptable
   </b>
   to leave the room while the laser is cutting;
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   You should always use the lowest power necessary for a given cut. Cutting cardboard require far less power than cutting plywood (50% speed, 100% power for one-ply); Proper focus is key to get the best results;
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   if there is a flameout during a cut, stop the laser immediately including the fume extractor as the airflow is fanning the flame. In most cases, the fire will die by itself.  Needless to say, taking a video of the flames spreading before intervening is also
   <b>
    unacceptable.
   </b>
   It is also dangerous to move burning material out of the laser enclosure as it can cause the fire to spread.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   if the fire seems to get out of control, use the fire extinguisher next to the door and notify Cornell Emergency services (670 255 11111). You might also need to complete a report (
   <a href="https://ehs.cornell.edu/incident-reporting">
    https://ehs.cornell.edu/incident-reporting
   </a>
   ). In any case, you should report the incident to us as soon as possible.
  </p>
 </li>
</list>
<p>
 Having a laser cutter accessible to this class students is a privilege and we should all work together so that future students can enjoy it as well.

 Do not hesitate to let us know if you have any questions about this.
