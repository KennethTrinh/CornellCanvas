  Hi Everyone,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  We received requests for an extension to the mechanical automation project.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Francois and I have discussed the requests and decided to
  <bold>
   extend the deadline to 23:59 today (May 3rd).
  </bold>
  This assignment has been posted for several weeks, with regular reminders about this deadline in class.  We can not further extend the ddl, because otherwise, it will overlap significantly with the mini project this week (Due this Friday) and the Jack-in-the-box project (due next Monday).
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  We hope the extra hours can help you to wrap up your project. Please note that the late policy will apply if your submission is late ( up to 24 hours for losing 20% grade).
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Please start your project early to avoid any last-minute uncertainties.
