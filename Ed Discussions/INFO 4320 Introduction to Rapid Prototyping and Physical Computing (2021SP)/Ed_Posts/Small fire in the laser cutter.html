  Hello,
  <break>
  </break>
  I was made aware that there was a small fire in the laser cutter this morning. There was no damage, but the extinguisher was used. Safety is very important for us, so it is important we better understand how this happened to prevent it in the future.

  If you were in control of the laser cutter when this happened please reach out to me (anonymously if you wish)  to provide a quick description of the incident and how the extinguisher was used.

  In advance, thank you for your help.
