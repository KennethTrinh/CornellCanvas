  The extension for the report and removal of a weekly project were really great moves that spoke to the needs of my group and many others, but I believe an extension for the prototype demo is also needed.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Some groups didn't get all their parts or didn't have access to the right tools (drills, saws, etc...) until today. This means that many groups will be coming into Rhodes to get their work done tomorrow and Monday. This grouping would be fine during a non-COVID semester (minus the stress of cramming in work), but because groups need to use the laser cutter, the 3D printers and need to assemble their projects in the same spaces, there will be a lot of crowding. This puts students in a difficult and dubious situation. It de facto asks students to cram a lot of work into a small amount of time, forsaking other responsibilities. It also de facto puts pressure on students to enter into crowded environments which we know are not yet safe.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  With advanced knowledge of this inevitable COVID crowding, competition for shared resources and the stress factors from having to cram in project completion amid other work because parts/tools weren't in stock yet, I believe it is wise, fair, and kind to give an extension for the prototype demo as well. This will allow students to space out their work better and be less likely to encounter crowds.

  I ask you to please give an extension for the prototype demo. Me and many others would greatly appreciate it.

  We decided to not grade Monday's session. Instead, just bring in whatever prototype you have and we will provide you feedback and help from there.

  Francois just posted another post detailed this.

  Hope this helps.
