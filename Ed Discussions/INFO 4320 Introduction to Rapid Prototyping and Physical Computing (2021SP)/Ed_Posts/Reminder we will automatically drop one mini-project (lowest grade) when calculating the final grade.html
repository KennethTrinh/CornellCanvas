 Hi Everyone,
</p>
<p>
 The final weeks can be stressful. To help you plan your time around different projects, I would like to remind you about the policy we announced 3 weeks ago.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  We will drop one mini-project (which you received the lowest grade) when calculating the final grade for each student.  You do not need to do anything to get this policy.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 The details of the announcement are in this post:
