  I uploaded my code as a .ino file, but I'm unable to open the file / create a sketch after I re-download it from Canvas. Is this going to be an issue for the TAs? Is there another format I can submit the file in?

  How about zip your submission files? That may help.

  I think the reason you may not be able to open it is because Arduino sketches need to be inside a folder that matches the name of the .ino file. Zipping helps with this, because you can send the whole folder instead of just the .ino.

  Good point. It usually requires to create a folder with the right name to open it.
