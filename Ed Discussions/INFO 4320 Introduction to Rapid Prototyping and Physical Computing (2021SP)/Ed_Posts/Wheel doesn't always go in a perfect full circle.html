 For the mini project the wheel doesn't turn the same amount every time. I think the light sensor only picks up on some of the spokes so sometimes it turns 1.5 times and sometimes it only turns half way. Is that okay? Or is there a way to fix it to get it to do exactly one turn.

  Yes, you may need to adjust the potentiometer so that it gives reliable results.
