  Is there any resource that details the specifications for the legos in our kit? I would like to use the gears and axels provided in our lego kit for the design assignment, but it would be helpful to know the dimensions I need to prepare my sketches in. Knowing the specifications for the 3D printed servo motor-to-axel parts, for example, would also be helpful!

  Here are two files showing the projection of the adaptor. Please remember that the laser cut sas a width so you might need to offset the cut to get the proper dimensions.
