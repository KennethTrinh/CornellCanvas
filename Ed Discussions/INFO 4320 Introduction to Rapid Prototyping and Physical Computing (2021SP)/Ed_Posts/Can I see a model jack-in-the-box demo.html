  TO have a better understanding of what the project should look like? A pic or video would be fine -- and i think helpful to a lot of ppl in class who are still confused :)

  Below is the picture of the model I presented in class. It is important to remember that this is a design assignment, so you should feel free to create your own design, starting with a simple implementation and adding to it as time permits.

  We will be happy to answer any questions you might have during the design process.
