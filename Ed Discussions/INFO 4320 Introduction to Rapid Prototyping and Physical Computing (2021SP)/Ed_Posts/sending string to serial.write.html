  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I am confused about how to send the degree and range reading to Serial.write for the LIDAR project.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Serial.write does not seem to be able to take multiple values, and if I put it all in a string, it does not unpack the variable values in the string.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For example, right now I have
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Serial.write("angle, range.")
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  This just sends a string of "angle,range." If I take out the quotations, an error comes up - it doesn't like the comma and period.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  How do I send the range and angle values?

  I can only do it with Serial.print - I think that is why it wasn't working - write is only for bytes and chars?

  Yes, it is more difficult to do this with writes.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  As Cheng said, the simplest way is to use one print for the angle, one for the comma, one for the range, and one for the final period.

  You do not need to send all values by just one call of serial.print or serial.write.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  You can call serial. print multiple times.   Each time you output one char of the string. For instance, "11,11."  can be sent by calling serial.print 4 times.
