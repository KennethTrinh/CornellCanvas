 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 I am confused about how to send the degree and range reading to Serial.write for the LIDAR project.
</p>
<p>
 Serial.write does not seem to be able to take multiple values, and if I put it all in a string, it does not unpack the variable values in the string.
</p>
<p>
 For example, right now I have
</p>
<p>
 Serial.write("angle, range.")
</p>
<p>
 This just sends a string of "angle,range." If I take out the quotations, an error comes up - it doesn't like the comma and period.
</p>
<p>
 How do I send the range and angle values?
</p>

  You do not need to send all values by just one call of serial.print or serial.write.
 </p>
 <p>
  You can call serial. print multiple times.   Each time you output one char of the string. For instance, "11,11."  can be sent by calling serial.print 4 times.

    I can only do it with Serial.print - I think that is why it wasn't working - write is only for bytes and chars?

     Yes, it is more difficult to do this with writes.
    </p>
    <p>
     As Cheng said, the simplest way is to use one print for the angle, one for the comma, one for the range, and one for the final period.
