 Are any of the TA's super familiar with using Raspberry Pi's? We were thinking about possibly using it as part of our final project and wanted to see if we would be able to get help with it from the course staff.

  As we discussed today, it is rarely the case that a project require a Raspberry Pi as our micro-controller has a WiFi module. The only exception might be the need for a very fast response time. What would you like to use it for?
