  My motor isn't running at all, even though I am pretty sure my circuit is correct. I tried using a multimeter but there is no current running through it. Any possible explanation for why this could be happening? (i.e. motor is broken, 16-pin driver is broken, etc.)

  The chance of the motor and H-bridge are broken is pretty low.  It is usually caused by wiring or the coding issue.

  We need to see your circuit and code to debug here. You can go to OH. or posting the circuit and code and make the post only visible to the instructors and TAs.
