  Could you please let me know how to use the LiPo battery to make it portable? Also, can we recharge the battery in the circuit?

  Good question. You can just plug the lipo batter on the side of the ESP32 board.

  This Adafruit Feather ESP32 has a built-in charger for LiPo battery. If you connect ESP32 with both li-po battery and USB cable at the same time, the battery will be charged.
