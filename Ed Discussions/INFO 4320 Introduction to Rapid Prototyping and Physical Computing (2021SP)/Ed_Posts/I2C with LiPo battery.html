 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 Could you please let me know how to use the LiPo battery to make it portable? Also, can we recharge the battery in the circuit?
</p>
<p>
 Thanks!
</p>

  Good question. You can just plug the lipo batter on the side of the ESP32 board.

 <p>
  This Adafruit Feather ESP32 has a built-in charger for LiPo battery. If you connect ESP32 with both li-po battery and USB cable at the same time, the battery will be charged.
