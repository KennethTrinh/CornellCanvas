  Hello,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I had a few questions for the Morse Code assignment:
 </paragraph>
 <list style="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    I assumed that the morse code should work with lowercase, is that correct?
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    For non-alphanumeric characters it was mentioned that a space should be used.  However there are 3 different types of spaces.  Is a space equal to 300ms (one dot) sufficient?
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    Is it ok if I also print my dots and dashes (as "." and "_") in the serial monitor for the final submission?
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
 </list>
 <paragraph>
  Thanks!

  Hi Daniel,
  <break>

  For this assignment you only have to consider numeral any other characters can be handled as a space (i.e the longest pause).

  It is a great idea to print the dots and dashes on serial as a debugging tool.
