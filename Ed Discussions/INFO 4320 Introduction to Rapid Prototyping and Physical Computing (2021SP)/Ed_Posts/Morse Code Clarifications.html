 Hello,
</p>
<p>
 I had a few questions for the Morse Code assignment:
</p>
<list style="bullet">
 <li>
  <p>
   I assumed that the morse code should work with lowercase, is that correct?
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   For non-alphanumeric characters it was mentioned that a space should be used.  However there are 3 different types of spaces.  Is a space equal to 300ms (one dot) sufficient?
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Is it ok if I also print my dots and dashes (as "." and "_") in the serial monitor for the final submission?
  </p>
 </li>
</list>
<p>
 Thanks!
</p>

  Hi Daniel,

  For this assignment you only have to consider numeral any other characters can be handled as a space (i.e the longest pause).

  It is a great idea to print the dots and dashes on serial as a debugging tool.
