  I started getting this error whenever trying to upload my code:
 </paragraph>
 <pre>bash: line 0: [: missing `]'

exit status 2

/Applications/Arduino.app/Contents/Java/arduino-builder returned 2

Error compiling for board Adafruit ESP32 Feather.
</pre>
 <paragraph>
  How do I fix this?

  It seems like there was error on the code.  "bash: line 0: [: missing `]'
  <break>
  </break>
  ".

  Could you give us some context for this error? Did you change your system between the time when compilations were OK, and compile were not OK?
