 I started getting this error whenever trying to upload my code:
</p>
<pre>bash: line 0: [: missing `]'

exit status 2

/Applications/Arduino.app/Contents/Java/arduino-builder returned 2

Error compiling for board Adafruit ESP32 Feather.
</pre>
<p>
 How do I fix this?
</p>

  Could you give us some context for this error? Did you change your system between the time when compilations were OK, and compile were not OK?

   It seems like there was error on the code.  "bash: line 0: [: missing `]'
   <break>
   </break>
   ".
  </p>
  <p>
   Need to dive deeper on your code to find the problem.
