 My teammate and I have tried all we could with the knock sensor, connecting it to both power supplies of 3.3 and 5V. However, no matter how much we vibrate/touch the sensor portion, the digitally read output stays at High and doesn't change. Do you know why this is?

  The pulse generated by this sensor could be quite short and this could cause problems. Did you observe the signal with the logic analyzer to check if the pulse is present?
