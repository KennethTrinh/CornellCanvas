 Hi,

<p>
 Some of you reported having issues on finding the hardware in PulseView after you select the driver and scan. The picture below is the UI, including  the driver name and the interface how it look if the scan is successful.
</p>
<p>
 We have tried to recreate the issue on our laptops. but none of us encountered  these issues.  To help us understand this problem, if you have problems on setting up logic analyzer,
 <b>
  can you please reply in this thread including the following info:

</p>
<p>
 1. Did you successfully install Pulse View, if so, which version did you use ( there are two versions one is nightly build and the other is 0.4.2)
</p>
<p>
 2. Whats the configuration of your computer, windows, Macbook, or linux? Which version of operating system you are using?
</p>
<p>
 3. What is your issue ? (e.g., you can not find the device, you can not install the software).

  1. I successfully installed PulseView 0.4.2.
 </p>
 <p>
  2. I'm on macOS Big Sur (11.1).
 </p>
 <p>
  3. I am able to choose the 'fx2lafw' driver, but do not see anything (eg. Salae Logic) even when I click 'Scan for devices using driver above'.
