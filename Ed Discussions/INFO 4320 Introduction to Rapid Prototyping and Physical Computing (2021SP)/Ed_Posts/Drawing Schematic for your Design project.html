  We got some questions on how to draw the schematic for your design project (RGB LED).
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  You can either 1) draw it by hand on paper, or 2) using software platforms to draw the schematic.  Both would satisfy the requirements.

 <paragraph>
  Here are some of the software/platforms which you can  draw schematics:

  If we use tinkercad, is there any way to get the Adafruit microcontroller in our circuit?

  There is 3rd-party library for adafruit controller.

  Given the time constraints,  there are two options:

 <paragraph>
  1. Draw things by hands on paper.
 </paragraph>

  2. Use Arduino as the replacement in tinkercad. But explain in text on what would have been different on ESP32.
