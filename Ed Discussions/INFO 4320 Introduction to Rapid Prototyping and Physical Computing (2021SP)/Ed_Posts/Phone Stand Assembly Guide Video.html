 Below is a video showing how to assemble the phone stand. This stand will make it easier for us to help with debugging your circuits and keep your hands free. If you have any issues just thread below and we'll try to get back to you as soon as possible.

  In my kit, I don't have the sticks show in the video. I have looked through all the bags or boxes. What should I do in this situation?

   Hi Danni,

   Sorry about this. Please contact one of the TA and we will arrange to have new set for you. Alternatively if you have 4mm skewer at home you can create you own set.

   Francois.
