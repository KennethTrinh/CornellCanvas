  In my kit, I don't have the sticks show in the video. I have looked through all the bags or boxes. What should I do in this situation?

  Hi Danni,

  Sorry about this. Please contact one of the TA and we will arrange to have new set for you. Alternatively if you have 4mm skewer at home you can create you own set.
