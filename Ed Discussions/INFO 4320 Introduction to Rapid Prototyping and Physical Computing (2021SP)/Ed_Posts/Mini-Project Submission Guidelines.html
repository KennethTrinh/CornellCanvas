<p>
 Mini-project submissions should follow the format below:
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Video
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 Please include a
 <b>
  YouTube link
 </b>
 to your video in the assignment comments on Canvas. This will be enforced for this week's mini-project (Morse code motor) because the professors mentioned this in Monday's lecture. Do not submit Google Drive links, because those take several minutes to load.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Code
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 Please submit your code as a
 <b>
  .txt
 </b>
 file. This allows the TAs to view your code without having to download it. This will
 <b>
  not
 </b>
 be enforced for this week's mini-projectâ€”if you have submitted the assignment already, you do not have to resubmit it. For everyone else, I would highly encourage you to copy and paste your code into a text file. The extra few seconds it takes on your end save up to a minute on our end. Thanks!

  If I already submitted my mini-project but with the youtube link in a PDF with the submission, should I resubmit?
