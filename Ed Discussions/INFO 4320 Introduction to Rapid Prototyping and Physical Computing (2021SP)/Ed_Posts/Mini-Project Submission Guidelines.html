  Mini-project submissions should follow the format below:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <bold>
   Video
  </bold>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Please include a
  <bold>
   YouTube link
  </bold>
  to your video in the assignment comments on Canvas. This will be enforced for this week's mini-project (Morse code motor) because the professors mentioned this in Monday's lecture. Do not submit Google Drive links, because those take several minutes to load.

 <paragraph>
  <bold>
   Code
  </bold>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Please submit your code as a
  <bold>
   .txt
  </bold>
  file. This allows the TAs to view your code without having to download it. This will
  <bold>
   not
  </bold>
  be enforced for this week's mini-projectâ€”if you have submitted the assignment already, you do not have to resubmit it. For everyone else, I would highly encourage you to copy and paste your code into a text file. The extra few seconds it takes on your end save up to a minute on our end. Thanks!
