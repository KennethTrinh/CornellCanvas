  My team (Watering Planter) has 5 of these

  https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-stemma-soil-sensor-i2c-capacitive-moisture-sensor, but they're all giving us incorrect readings for the moisture even though the temperature is right. Is your team having the same problem?

  @Naotake I think one of the sensors needs to be soldered right? If so, I can probably solder it and bring it to the Automated Terrarium team box. Where can I find this sensor? Also, I saw your post that you fixed the problem! Yay! Can you pass that information to Anyi so that they don't have the same issue as well?

  @Anyi Can you let me know where I can locate your team box?

  @Anyi I left the moisture sensor taped to the top of your box in 129 (next to the sink @mose). I can send you the code thatâ€™s needed to make it work with the feather board if you email me at nk453 or on messenger/text at 9177514559 or something
