 Does any team have a spare soil moisture sensor? We (Automated Terrarium) would really appreciate it!!

  , but they're all giving us incorrect readings for the moisture even though the temperature is right. Is your team having the same problem?

   No we just never got ours :/ Could we possibly snag one and try it out tomorrow?

    @Naotake I think one of the sensors needs to be soldered right? If so, I can probably solder it and bring it to the Automated Terrarium team box. Where can I find this sensor? Also, I saw your post that you fixed the problem! Yay! Can you pass that information to Anyi so that they don't have the same issue as well?

   <p>
    @Anyi Can you let me know where I can locate your team box?

     @Anyi I left the moisture sensor taped to the top of your box in 129 (next to the sink @mose). I can send you the code thatâ€™s needed to make it work with the feather board if you email me at nk453 or on messenger/text at 9177514559 or something
