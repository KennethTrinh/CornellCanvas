  Hi Everyone,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Given this is the first week of class, many of you are spending time on configuring the hardware system. We decided to remove the requirement of using logic analyzer in your mini project and put it as optional.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  However, you are still expected to finish setting up the device this week, as we will use it next week.

  For the logic analyzer I don't have an extra USB port on my laptop but if I get a USB adapter with more ports would that work in configuring the device?
