 Hello, I uploaded my demo video for the Fan Motor project on Youtube. For some reason, the video becomes too bright to see any details of the serial monitor when viewing on a MacBook. Since it shows fine on a phone or a monitor, I believe it's an issue with the Macbook display. Is it okay to just include a short note in the comment or should I submit it in an alternative way?

  Yes that is fine for this week. Please just write down the reason for using a different link. You can also try and see if uploading your video to Youtube directly on your phone works fine.
