 I am connecting the Arduino board to one of the USB ports, but it is not showing up on the Serial Port. What do I do? I tried to restart my computer but it has not worked.

   This has never happened before - this is the first time. I also checked the serial port and the usb port isn't showing up.

    It is possible that your board is broken.  You can contact Hyunchul Lim (TA) for picking up a replacement board.

   I think the cord that connects the arduino board to the computer is broken, because I borrowed my friend's cord and it was working when I was using hers. I will contact TA Hyunchul Lim for a new cord.
