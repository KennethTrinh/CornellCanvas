  Hello,
  <break>
  </break>
  We will held a project Clinic during class on Monday. During in-person teaching, this class is held in the lab so that we can look at your design and find a quick solution to any problem you might have.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  With this in mind, it is important for your group to identify the most pressing issue(s) of your design and prepare a demo of the problem for the class.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Looking forward to help you all on Monday.

  Francois.
