 I am trying to follow the steps on the lecture slides for the uploading tool for Big Sur users but cannot seem to find that epstool file to rename to "old_epstool" using the path on the slides:
</p>
<p>
 Library/Arduino15/packages/esp32/tools/esptool_py/2.6.1
</p>
<p>
 did anyone else have this problem? Is there another path that you used?

  Follow up question: I downloaded the package, named it esptool and put it in the same place as esptool_old. I then followed the instructions to turn it into an executable file using my terminal. When I verify or try to upload the Blink file, I keep getting "error there is no such file or directory" - it doesn't recognize the new esptool file. Any suggestions?
 </p>

   it ended up being a security setting. I got the file to run. But there seems to be a module called "serial" that the file calls, that I don't seem to have. I tried to install it in my terminal, but that didn't work either. I am not sure how to proceed.

   Could you let us know where which part of this path is unaccessible?

    I figured it out - the version I downloaded is called 3.0.0, not 2.6.1

  I found that when you open the Preference Menu in Arduino, you can click on the file location at the bottom under the additional board manager URL input and it will take you to the correct file.
