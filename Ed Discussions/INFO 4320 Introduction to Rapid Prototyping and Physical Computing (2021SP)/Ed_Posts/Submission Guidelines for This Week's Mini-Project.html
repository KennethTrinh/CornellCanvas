     In the comments of your submission, add a link that goes to a
     <b>
      YouTube
     </b>
     video of the mechanism in motion.
     <b>
      Do not submit a Google Drive link, .mov, or .mp4 file
     </b>
     . Downloading these files takes a lot of time. You can animate the crank by right-clicking on the revolute joint that fixes your crank to the box and selecting "Animate Model." Here is an example: https://youtu.be/p8C3qCWlszU

 <b>
  Do not submit these in a .zip file.

 It adds an extra step on our end.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  If you have already submitted the assignment, please resubmit your files in this format.

</p>
<p>
 I apologize for sending this out a day before the due date, especially because over half of you have submitted already. However, these little steps on your end save hours on our end.
</p>
<p>
 Grades for the duck and envelope will be released tomorrow.

<p>
 Thank you!
