  I want to modify some pre-made McMaster-Carr gear models to make my own custom gears. Would that be acceptable? I will probably have 6 or more other parts that I create myself.

 <paragraph>
  Edit: The import feature doesn't seem to be working for me, so I'll try to make the gear myself

  The simplest (and recommended) way to create gear is to generate a profile using the gear generator we discussed in class and then create a solid based on the imported profile. Did you try this method?
