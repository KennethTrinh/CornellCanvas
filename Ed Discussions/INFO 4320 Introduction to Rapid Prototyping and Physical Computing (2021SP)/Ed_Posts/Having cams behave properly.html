  Hello,
  <break>
  </break>
  This morning I was asked if one can add gravity to animation so that cams will behave as expected. This is not possible in Fusion 360, but you can get a similar effect as follow:

 <list style="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    once the rod is in place and its linear constraint is set, select the constrain and set the limit by clicking on the red arrow next to it

   </figure>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    in the dialog box that opens, set the rest position to the lowest point you want the rod to go (-20mm here). You can do this by typing the value or moving the rod.

    The final step is to enable contacts:

   </figure>
  </list-item>
 </list>
 <paragraph>
  At this point, the rod should follow the cam both upward and downward.
  <break>

  Please do not hesitate to let us know if you have any questions about this.

  I did this and it seems to work, but the addition of the contact makes the motion study extremely laggy - if I disable contact, then the cam moves smoothly but once I enable contact, the cam barely moves. The same behavior occurs when I try to move the cam manually; it's extremely laggy and barely responds to my clicks. Is there a way to render the motion study or is it necessary to upload a smooth video of the motion study?

  I am not sure how complex your model is but one solution to speed things up is to define contacts sets (one for each rod/cam interaction). The contact analysis will only be performed between objects in contacts sets.

  Let me know if this helps.

  I have contact sets for each interaction and it's still extremely laggy; I have 7 rods.

  In that case, I will recommend using the renderer to render your animation study as it will be creating a movie of the animation for you. The system will render the model in the cloud so you can get the effect you want. Here is one

  example.

  I followed the steps in the video, and it is quite easy to create a great animation. Here is an example (Edu licenses get free credits).
