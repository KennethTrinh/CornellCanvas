 Hi! The laser cutter screen shows this message: XY disabled Y. I am not able to press "focus" and use "UP" and "down" to adjust the height.

  I was trying to help you by using the beam robot, but I saw you leave as I was connecting.

  If this happens while the laser was powered up, something is preventing the laser to home. Could you check that the head is free to move?

   ohhhh sorry, I didn't realize it! The head was only able to move in the red direction, not the blue direction.

   I removed everything below the head and I can't see what is preventing it to home.
