  Since groups may have ordered some parts in bulk (including ours), would it be possible to have a tracking log to document extra parts somewhere? Perhaps there can be a Google Sheet or thread on EdStem to post about it. This way groups can share with each other and put these parts to use without unnecessary orders. Thank you!

  I created
  <link href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IlZWuW9b16aIOOpCVRjTq13MkYAVxbg-oz_JyuqyY_Y/edit?usp=sharing"/>
  this spreadsheet where every group can share spares to lend or borrow. I will make an announcement about this soon.
