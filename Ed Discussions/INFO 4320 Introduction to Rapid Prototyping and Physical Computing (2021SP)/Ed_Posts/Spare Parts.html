 Since groups may have ordered some parts in bulk (including ours), would it be possible to have a tracking log to document extra parts somewhere? Perhaps there can be a Google Sheet or thread on EdStem to post about it. This way groups can share with each other and put these parts to use without unnecessary orders. Thank you!

  Hi Renee,
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks for your great suggestion!
 </p>
 <p>
  I created
  <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IlZWuW9b16aIOOpCVRjTq13MkYAVxbg-oz_JyuqyY_Y/edit?usp=sharing">
   this spreadsheet
  </a>
  where every group can share spares to lend or borrow. I will make an announcement about this soon.
 </p>
