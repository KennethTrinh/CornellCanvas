  Hi all!
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  We had a great suggestion of sharing extra parts among groups. (thanks Renee!)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  We created
  <link href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IlZWuW9b16aIOOpCVRjTq13MkYAVxbg-oz_JyuqyY_Y/edit#gid=0"/>
  this "lending and borrowing" spread sheet where each group can log spare parts that they'd like to lend or borrow. (please do not expect these items to come back to you although we call it "lend" or "borrow"..)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Here is how it works:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1) each group adds extra parts that they can lend with contact info (netID)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2) groups who'd like to borrow these parts can claim it by signing their group name with a number of pieces specified
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  3) the borrowing groups reach out to the contact to figure out how they can receive these parts
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  (Please see the example in the spreadsheet)
 </paragraph>

  Please let us know if you have any questions!
