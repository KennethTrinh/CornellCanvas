 I am using a Mac with Big Sur
</p>
<p>
 When I run the new esptool package, an error with the "import serial" line pops up - it says that "serial" does not exist. Thus, I can't verify or upload code in the Arduino application. I've tried to install pyserial using "pip install pyserial," as I believe that is the package "serial" is in, but it still doesn't work. Any suggestions?

   This is the error I get when I hit verify or upload:
  </b>
 </p>
 <p>
  Arduino: 1.8.13 (Mac OS X), Board: "Adafruit ESP32 Feather, 80MHz, 921600, None, Default"
 </p>
 <p>
  Traceback (most recent call last): File "/Library/Arduino15/packages/esp32/tools/esptool_py/3.0.0/esptool", line 38, in  import serial ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'serial' exit status 1 Error compiling for board Adafruit ESP32 Feather.

  This report would have more information with "Show verbose output during compilation" option enabled in File -&gt; Preferences.

  Do you already have your kit with the ESP32 board connected to your computer?

   I ended up uninstalling and reinstalling esp32 and that fixed it. I also re-downloaded and re-executed the extra Big Sur package if anyone else is getting the same error.
