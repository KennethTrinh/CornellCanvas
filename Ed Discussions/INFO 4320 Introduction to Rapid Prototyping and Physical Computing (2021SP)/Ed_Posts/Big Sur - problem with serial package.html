  I am using a Mac with Big Sur
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  When I run the new esptool package, an error with the "import serial" line pops up - it says that "serial" does not exist. Thus, I can't verify or upload code in the Arduino application. I've tried to install pyserial using "pip install pyserial," as I believe that is the package "serial" is in, but it still doesn't work. Any suggestions?

  Do you already have your kit with the ESP32 board connected to your computer?

  I ended up uninstalling and reinstalling esp32 and that fixed it. I also re-downloaded and re-executed the extra Big Sur package if anyone else is getting the same error.
