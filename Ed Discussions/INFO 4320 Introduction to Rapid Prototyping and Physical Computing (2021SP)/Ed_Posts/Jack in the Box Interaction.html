 For this requirement:
</p>
<list style="unordered">
 <li>
  <p>
   The mechanism might be triggered by opening the box or detecting an attempt to interact with the box;
  </p>
 </li>
</list>
<p>
 can we "interact with the box" by pressing a button on the board? Given the limitations of using a board, it's a little difficult to wire something that is placed on/inside the box itself.

  The kit provides a button with long wires, as well as extra wires allowing to connect sensors attached on the box to the board.
