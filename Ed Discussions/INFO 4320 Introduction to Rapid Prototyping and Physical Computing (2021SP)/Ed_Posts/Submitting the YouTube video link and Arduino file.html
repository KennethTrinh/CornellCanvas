 I currently submitted my assignment by submitting a zipped Arduino Sketch file with a link to the YouTube video in the comments with my submission, since I can't submit both as separate submissions. Is that the way we are supposed to do it?

  See #64 - we would like you to submit a YouTube link and a
  <b>
   .txt file
  </b>
  (.txt is much faster for us to preview). As for how to upload the YouTube link, you can use the Submission Details link at the upper right to add a comment to your upload (which can just be a text input):
