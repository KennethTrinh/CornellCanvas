      Live presentation of each project starting at 2pm. The presentations will take place in the socially distanced settings we have used during the semester and will be broadcasted on Zoom. Each team will have ample time to set up and will have 5 mins to conduct a live demo of their project (no presentation). We will send a more detailed schedule of the event on Monday.
