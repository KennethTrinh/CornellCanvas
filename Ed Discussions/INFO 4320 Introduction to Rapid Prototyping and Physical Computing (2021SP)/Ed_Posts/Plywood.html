 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 I have not picked up my plywood yet, so I talked to my TA about picking up plywood, but there seems to be confusion on how I can pick up my plywood. Can I get clarification on how plywood pick-up works?
</p>
<p>
 Thanks
</p>

  I cannot address specific problems since this post is Anonymous, but I will talk to the TA to clarify our approach.
