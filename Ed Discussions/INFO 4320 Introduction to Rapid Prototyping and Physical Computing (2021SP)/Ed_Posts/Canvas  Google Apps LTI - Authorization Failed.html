 I've tried various methods but somehow I can't seem to connect Canvas with my Cornell Mail account. Did anyone else have the same problem? Could I access the slides through a link instead? Thank you.

  Thank you! Both Safari and Chrome were creating issues initially, despite the usage of incognito mode. I'm unsure what permutations of these aspects would suffice, but it works well with a personal email on Chrome after disabling my privacy and ad blockers.

   This system does not work on Safari for some reason. It should be OK on Chrome. Let us know.

    Hi, thanks for bring this up.
   </p>
   <p>
    I tried with my personal gmail account to authorize, and it works for me.
   </p>
   <p>
    Would you mind trying your personal gmail account and see how that works?
   </p>

     Hi - I wanted to try this, but it looks like Canvas doesn't allow me to use a personal account. It looks like I'll need it to see the instructions for the Hello Arduino assignment, so what should I do about this?
    </p>

     edit: Never mind, it seems to only work in Chrome (I'm mainly a Firefox user)
