  Hello,
  <break>

  I just posted early project feedback on each group page inside Canvas. Be sure to take a look as soon as possible so that we can address any questions you might have quickly. Thanks.

  Can you clarify where we can find your feedback? I looked at the "Related Works" assignment submission, but didn't see any feedback. If there's a Groups tab in Canvas, I don't think it's shared/published to me. Thanks in advance for your help!

  As this is not part of grading, we posted it as a comment on your group page. Unfortunately I cannot test the group page directly. Let me know if you can find it, if not I will ask for help from Canvas.
