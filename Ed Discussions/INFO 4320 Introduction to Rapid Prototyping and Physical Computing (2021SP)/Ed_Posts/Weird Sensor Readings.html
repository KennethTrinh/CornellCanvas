 I keep getting weird readings on my range finder. Sometimes it says the distance is getting farther away even though I'm moving the sensor closer, and sometimes it works correctly - it also seems to "jump" to different readings without me moving it. Is this happening to anyone else? Is there a way to fix it?

 My code does seem to work for what the sensor reads - yellow when its too close and red when its too far. The brightness also works and so does the beeping when it hits the target distance. I also checked my wiring and can't find anything strange. My video is just not going to look right because the sensor does not work correctly.

  The range sensor does not work when the distance is shorter than 15 CM.  What you saw was probably because the distance is too short.

   My range finder also seems to have the same issue and I have tried to use larger distances. For some reason my values seem to approach a peak of about 60cm and then drop off in either direction regardless of if I get closer or further away. Could this be an issue with the sensor?
