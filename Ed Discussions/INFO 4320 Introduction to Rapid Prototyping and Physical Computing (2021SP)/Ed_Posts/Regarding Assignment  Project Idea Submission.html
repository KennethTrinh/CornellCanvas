 Hello! I have some questions regarding assignment submissions.
</p>
<p>
 1. Are you planning to receive all submissions via Canvas this semester? If so, is it possible for the assignments tab on Canvas to only hold submittable assignments? I realized that currently there is a mix of reading assignments + assignments that we actually have to submit. Therefore, I thought it might be more intuitive and easy to find assignments if you separate submittable assignments from the readings since the reading tend not to have a hard deadline and are already organized in the modules tab :)
</p>
<p>
 2.  Our group just had a meeting with our TA, and we did settle on an idea. Are we going to have to submit our idea?
</p>
<p>
 Thank you so much for your help!

  For the second questions, the teaching team will be reviewing all project ideas shortly and provide feedback as needed.

   I looked into highlighting assignments on Canvas. While it will not be possible to only include submittable items in the "Assignment" category, we will be sure to keep assignments indented in the Modules display. Further I changed the order in which information is presented on the assignment page so that submission will now appear first when you click on "show by type" on the top right corner of the assignments page.

   Finally, all assignments appear on the class calendar which can be easily merge into your personal calendar using the
