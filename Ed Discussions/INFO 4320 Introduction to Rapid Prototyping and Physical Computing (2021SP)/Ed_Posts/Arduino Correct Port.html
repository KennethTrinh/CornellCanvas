  I'm having an issue getting the correct port to come up for Mac. I installed the specific driver for Mac as well as the esptool patch. I'm thinking this is because I don't yet have a USB-C-style connector. Once I get this and connect it, should the correct port come up?

  This is because you have not plug in the microcontroller yet.  We plan to distribute the hardware box shortly. Once you connect the hardware to your laptop, the correct port should show up in the list.

  Hi! Same question here, just wondering have you fixed the problem or not? I have the microcontroller and wondering if the usb is supposed to connect to my computer. I also use mac so it is a type-c connector so it does not work. I cannot find the port we need.
