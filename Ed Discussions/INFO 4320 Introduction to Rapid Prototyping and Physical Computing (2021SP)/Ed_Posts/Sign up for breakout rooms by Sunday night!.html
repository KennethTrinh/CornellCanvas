  Hi everyone,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  We're trying out a new way to manage breakout rooms moving forward. Here's how it works:

 <list style="number">

    Put your name in a spot on
    <link href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n5qFr8t2UmP6e6CTZwdeM-_CJv2YHaDwOGelTYiRQPo/edit#gid=0"/>
    this google sheet
    <bold>
     before Sunday night.
    </bold>
    Feel free to coordinate with friends or your group, or just sign up randomly.
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>

    During lecture, we'll ask you to join an assigned breakout room—the one you chose—for the working sessions. We'll bring you back to the main room when the time is up.

    Francois and Cheng will move between breakout rooms to help you out. If you have a more-time-consuming problem, they'll send you to one of the TAs.

 </list>

  We'll check this google sheet on Monday to form the breakout rooms, but we won't look at it after that. If you want to change your breakout room, let us know and we'll make the change for you.
