 My group has a Raspberry Pi Zero W, and they come without header pins soldered on; is there a soldering station accessible to us that we can use?
</p>
<p>
 edit: The IMU we ordered also has one, and I have a feeling that many other groups will have similar issues (plus the need to learn to solder)

  Hi sorry for the delayed reply.  Did you talk to your TA about the soldering need? We encourage the TA to help to solder things if possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soldering can require some time to learn and train. We try to discourage students who did not have the experience to solder things.
 </p>
 <p>
  We can also provide the soldering tools if needed. But checking with your TA first.

   Hi Cheng - my group was able to borrow a soldering iron outside of this class to get the job done. We soldered header pins onto our components to allow us to use breadboards, and we told our TA about it, so we no longer have soldering needs at this point

    Sorry for the delayed response. We were discussing this within our teaching team.  I am glad to see this has been finished. We can also provide soldering tools if your team has the skills to solder in the future.
