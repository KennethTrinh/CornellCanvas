 When adjusting the brightness depending on the distance from the range finder, I have noticed that the green shows less variation than the red. Since the difference in distance from the actual to the target is smaller for the green, the LED does not dim and brighten as noticeably. Is it okay to map the brightness separately for the green LED and the red LED to make it more obvious, or should they match exactly?

  Great observation. Yes, it is OK to correct for the brightness variation of each color.
