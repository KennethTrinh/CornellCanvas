 Hello,
 <break>
 </break>
 Thanks to the help of Gus from ITSG, it is now easy to check the status of all our printers and start a job on a given printer in one place:
 <a href="http://en-octofarm-01.coecis.cornell.edu:4000/">
  OctoFarm
 </a>
</p>
<p>
 The logging credentials as the same as the credentials for each individual printer.
 <break>
 </break>
 <break>
 </break>
 In the next couple of days, more printers will also be equipped with a camera making it easier to check if a print is going as planned.
 <break>

 Please let us know if you are running into difficulty accessing the site.

 Francois.

  I tried to open the OctoFarm link, but I was getting an error message (taking too long to load). Is anyone else running into this issue?

   Like the printer's server, you need to be on VPN to get access to this site.

    I'm on the eduroam wifi, but it still won't allow me to connect. Should I be on a different network?

     You need to use the Cornell VPN system to work with this system. More information could be found there. Let us know if you have any difficulties connecting to the Cornell VPN system.
