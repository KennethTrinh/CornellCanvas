 I'm thinking about a way to share code among my group members for my group's final project. I'd ideally like to have this as something I can share in the future, but with academic integrity in mind, should the GitHub repository I make be public or private?

  There's always the option to make a private repository now and change the visibility later. I'd start with it private for now, but I imagine that once the semester's over you could make it public.
