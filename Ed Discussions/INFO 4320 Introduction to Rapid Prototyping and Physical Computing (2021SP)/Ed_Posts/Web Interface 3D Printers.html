 It seems that a lot of the 3d printers in Rhodes 114 are often occupied. Pi 6, 10, and 11 - the ones with urls don't seem to work? Upon going to the url, it shows up as page not able to be found. The ones where the urls do work, it says that the username/passwords are invalid.

 Is it also possible for there to be a video demoing how to refill the filament? Since the printers take so long every machine is very needed.

  I just went through printers 8 to 14 and with the exception of 13 I was able to reach the printer and login as info4320. Are you accessing them through VPN (or RedRover)? Could you send us more details?

  Reloading filament is often a source of failure so it is best if we do it. Could you let us know when one is out? Thanks.
