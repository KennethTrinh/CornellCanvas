  For A3:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  When the mini project says we need to set 2 distances, does this mean we should adjust the target distance on the poteniometer slightly and then showcase that it still works?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Also, by "gradually adjust the distance", does that mean we should be turning the potentiometer knob or physically moving the sensor?

  Yes, adjust the potentiometer to change the target distance and demonstrate that your code works for this new distance. Try not to put the new distance too close (&lt;5 cm) together to the old one.

  You can adjust the distance by either moving the sensor toward your object or moving your object toward the sensor. We want to see the LED changing in brightness as it gets closer/farther.
