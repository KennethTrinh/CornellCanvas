  Hey everyone! Sorry for the long post, "Too Long Didn't Read" at the end lol. So I'm still trying to find group mates or a group to join, so if anyone is still looking for a group, or if anyone has an open slot in their team please reach out! The add period ends on Monday and I won't be able to take this class if I don't get placed. The project I had in mind was a robotic maze-solving hamster, thinking that at the ScienCenter the kids could create mazes and then try to solve the maze before the hamster did. It could have a bunch of different emoting actuation too to try to make it as engaging, personifiable, and fun as possible. BUT I'm totally down to work on any project, all the short descriptions I've read look really cool!
