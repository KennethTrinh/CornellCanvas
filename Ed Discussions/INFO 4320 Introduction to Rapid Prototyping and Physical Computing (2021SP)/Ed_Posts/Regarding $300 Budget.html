  I have a question regarding the $300 budget limit. Our team members have been working really hard to match the budget limit for the project, but we were not able to find a way to reduce the part list in any practical way. We tried asking for help, but our TA has not been responsive over the weekend. Is it okay to submit a part list that is slightly over $300 for the initial design (our budget is currently $391) submission and later reduce it after consulting with the course staff?
