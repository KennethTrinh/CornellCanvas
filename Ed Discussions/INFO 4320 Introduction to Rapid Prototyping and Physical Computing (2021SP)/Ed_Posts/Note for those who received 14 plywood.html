  We handed a piece of 1/4 plywood instead of 1/8 plywood to some of you. These plywood sheets are thicker, so you will need to design your box specifically for the thickness. Also, you will need to make speed slower to cut it through with the laser cutter. I would recommend to test with a small piece like a square to make sure that your laser cutter parameters work well for your plywood material.
