  Hello,
  <break>
  </break>
  I wanted to remind everyone that while we are not asking you to 3D print your model, you should create a model that will work if it was 3D printed. In particular, no part should be "floating" without any connection or support.

  I was also please to see that some of you are creating complex mechanisms. For some mechanisms, such as a gear with some teeth missing to create an abrupt movement, the only way to animate them will be to synchronize the motions of the different elements by hand.

  Do not hesitate to reach out to the teaching team if you have any questions.
