 Hello,
 <break>
 </break>
 I wanted to remind everyone that while we are not asking you to 3D print your model, you should create a model that will work if it was 3D printed. In particular, no part should be "floating" without any connection or support.

 I was also please to see that some of you are creating complex mechanisms. For some mechanisms, such as a gear with some teeth missing to create an abrupt movement, the only way to animate them will be to synchronize the motions of the different elements by hand.
</p>

 Do not hesitate to reach out to the teaching team if you have any questions.
