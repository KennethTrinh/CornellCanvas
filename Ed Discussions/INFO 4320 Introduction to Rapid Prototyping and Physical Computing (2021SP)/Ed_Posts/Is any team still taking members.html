 Hi all,
</p>
<p>
 I am looking for any team that is currently still taking members. I am skilled in 3D modeling, all digital fabrication methods, interaction design, and basic programming. I am interested in a wide range of topics, but not limited to: wearable, AR/VR, household automation, responsive environment, and so on. Hit me up if you still have any spots on the team pls! my email is yl3464@cornell.edu
</p>
