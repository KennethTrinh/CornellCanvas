 Hello, I would like to ask questions regarding Previous Work and Objectives to clarify some requirements for the documentation we are supposed to submit next Monday.
</p>
<list style="number">
 <li>
  <p>
   For the deliverables, our group members are confused about the difference between the last two parts (ones with 20% weight and 40% weight). It looks like the two parts have very similar descriptions except that the former one asks us to present it to our TA. What exactly  is the difference?
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   For elaborating on the priority ranking of each feature, do you have a specific style of preference? Or can we use bulletpoints?
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   For researching and analyzing similar work, how similar should they be? Should previous work have the exact same mechanism? Can it be from a different field? We are curious about the expectations.
  </p>
 </li>
</list>
<p>
 Thank you so much!
</p>

  I will be happy to help here:

    After presenting your initial design, your TA will provide feedback that you will then integrate into your final design proposal. It is most likely that the two designs will be quite different;
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    AN ordered list will work to express the priority of each features;
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    The goal of the previous work search is to understand how people have implemented your ideas in the past. The wider the search the more likely you will find an interesting solution to solve your problem. So at this point, it is important not to focus on a specific mechanism.
