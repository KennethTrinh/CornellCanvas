 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 I just wanted to ask if there is a write-up we need to submit for the final version of the project. We used to have write-ups for initial design and the first prototype so we just wanted to make sure there was nothing due except for the demo session at this stage.

  No. You do not need to submit any write-up.
 </p>
 <p>
  We decided to cancel this requirement in April to lower the workload of the students.

  If you insist on writing one, we are happy to read it though.
