  Hi Everyone,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Some of you have not formed a team yet.  We plan to use part of Wed's class to help you find a team. Here is the plan.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  _________________________________________
 </paragraph>

   If you have formed a team (3 or 4 students), please sign up for a weekly meeting with one of the 6 TAs (we just had two more TA, Alex and Isaac) using this google Sheets:

 </paragraph>

  Please note that we may switch teams between TAs to balance the workload later.

   If you are looking for a team, here is what you can do:
  </bold>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <bold>
   1. Check ideas on Miro
  </bold>
  :  We have sorted all ideas on Miro and converged 13 topic areas, Food machine, Household Automation, Health, Music, Paint/Print, Pets, Fashion$Clothing,  Toys, Wearables, Games/VR,  Energy/Solar, Walking Robots, Agriculture.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2.
  <bold>
   We created 13 channels on Discord for these 13 topics respectively.
  </bold>
  Each channel has two sub-channels for video/audio chat and text communication respectively.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  3.
  <bold>
   During tomorrow's class, we will leave around 30 mins such that you can go into the channels you are interested in to have direct video/audio chat with other students who share similar interests.
  </bold>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  4.
  <bold>
   After class, you can post your ideas and team seeking information on the text sub-channel under each topic.
  </bold>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  5.
  <bold>
   If you do not have preferred topics or you are broadly looking for teammates,
  </bold>
  you can post information on #finding-a-team channel on Discord, or Ed Discussion.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For instance, if I want to work on a project related to Pets, I would 1) first check out all ideas on the Pet Frame on Miro . 2) Then I will talk to others using the audio/video sub-channel under Pet Channel on Discord during the class. 3) after class, I can post my ideas about Pets on the text sub-channel under Pet channel or #finding-a-team channel, or Ed Discussion.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Once you form a team, please sign up a meeting with TA ASAP as a way of declaring teams.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Please let us know if you have any questions. See you all tomorrow.
