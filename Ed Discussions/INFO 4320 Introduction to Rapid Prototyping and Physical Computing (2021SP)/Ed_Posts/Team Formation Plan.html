 Hi Everyone,
</p>
<p>
 Some of you have not formed a team yet.  We plan to use part of Wed's class to help you find a team. Here is the plan.
</p>
<p>
 _________________________________________
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  If you have formed a team (3 or 4 students), please sign up for a weekly meeting with one of the 6 TAs (we just had two more TA, Alex and Isaac) using this google Sheets:

 </a>
</p>
<p>
 Please note that we may switch teams between TAs to balance the workload later.
</p>

  If you are looking for a team, here is what you can do:
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  1. Check ideas on Miro
 </b>
 :  We have sorted all ideas on Miro and converged 13 topic areas, Food machine, Household Automation, Health, Music, Paint/Print, Pets, Fashion$Clothing,  Toys, Wearables, Games/VR,  Energy/Solar, Walking Robots, Agriculture.
</p>
<p>
 2.
 <b>
  We created 13 channels on Discord for these 13 topics respectively.
 </b>
 Each channel has two sub-channels for video/audio chat and text communication respectively.
</p>
<p>
 3.
 <b>
  During tomorrow's class, we will leave around 30 mins such that you can go into the channels you are interested in to have direct video/audio chat with other students who share similar interests.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 4.
 <b>
  After class, you can post your ideas and team seeking information on the text sub-channel under each topic.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 5.
 <b>
  If you do not have preferred topics or you are broadly looking for teammates,
 </b>
 you can post information on #finding-a-team channel on Discord, or Ed Discussion.
</p>
<p>
 For instance, if I want to work on a project related to Pets, I would 1) first check out all ideas on the Pet Frame on Miro . 2) Then I will talk to others using the audio/video sub-channel under Pet Channel on Discord during the class. 3) after class, I can post my ideas about Pets on the text sub-channel under Pet channel or #finding-a-team channel, or Ed Discussion.
</p>
<p>
 Once you form a team, please sign up a meeting with TA ASAP as a way of declaring teams.
</p>
<p>
 Please let us know if you have any questions. See you all tomorrow.
</p>
