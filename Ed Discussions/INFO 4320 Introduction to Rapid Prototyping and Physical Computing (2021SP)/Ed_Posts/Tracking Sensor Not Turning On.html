 I plugged in the tracking sensor to my board and it won't turn on. I saw that there should be a red light on the sensor that turns on if it's working, but I can't seem to figure out what's wrong.

 I plugged in S to pin 32 and G to ground and V+ to power (3.3V).

  If you think that your sensor is broken, you can pick a new one in Rhodes 114 as we have many spares there.

   Hi, we need more info on this case. Do you mind sharing more of your circuits with us? Please set it visible to only TA and instructors.

    I just attended OH and it appears as though pressing down on the knob/potentiometer with the screwdriver (or a finger nail) starts incrementing the pulsecount as it should, but when i let go, the sensor stops sensing anything.

    I'm wondering if my sensor is broken since this doesn't seem like its intended behavior.
