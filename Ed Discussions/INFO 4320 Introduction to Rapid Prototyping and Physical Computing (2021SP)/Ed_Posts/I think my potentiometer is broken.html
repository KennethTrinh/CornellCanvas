 So my motor only turns when the screw on the potentiometer is pressed down on and now it has stopped working completely (haven't changed anything). I was told in office hours that it might be broken is there any way for me to get a new one today or early tommorow? Thanks

  Hyunchul told me that he has placed some extra motors in Rhodes 114. Please talk to him for details.

   Please contact TA Hyunchu Lim hl2365@cornell.edu , and see whether he can help set up an appointment to replace the motor.
