  So my motor only turns when the screw on the potentiometer is pressed down on and now it has stopped working completely (haven't changed anything). I was told in office hours that it might be broken is there any way for me to get a new one today or early tommorow? Thanks

  Please contact TA Hyunchu Lim hl2365@cornell.edu , and see whether he can help set up an appointment to replace the motor.
