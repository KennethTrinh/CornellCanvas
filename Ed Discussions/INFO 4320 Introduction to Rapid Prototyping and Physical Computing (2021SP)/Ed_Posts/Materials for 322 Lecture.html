 Do we need any specific material for lecture tomorrow? I know we will be doing demos of our cardboard prototypes, but are we doing anything else (ie. Lego building, more Fusion 360, etc)?

  The only activity we have for tomorrow is to have each team present their cardboard prototypes and get feedback from the instructors and other students.

  We plan to do more Legos on this coming Wed.
