  Hi all,

  I heard from some of you that you do no have access to Rhodes 114. We have requested access for all of you before, but there seems to be technical difficulties to grant the access. As a result, some of you have access but others don't. We are so sorry for the inconvenience.

 <paragraph>
  We would like to send another request, so that you can have access as soon as possible.
