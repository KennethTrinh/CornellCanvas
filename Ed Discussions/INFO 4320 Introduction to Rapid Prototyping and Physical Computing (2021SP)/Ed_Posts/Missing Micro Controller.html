 For those of us who were missing the micro controller in our kit, when might we expect to receive that? (as I expect I'll have some errors to work through before Friday)

  Sorry this happened. We will bring some micro controllers and other parts to Rhodes 114 today, so that those who have missing parts can come and pick. We will update on this once they are ready for pick-up.
