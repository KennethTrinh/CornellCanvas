  I thought I remembered reading somewhere that we cant include any libraries for the RGB LED project (like having a line that says "#include&lt;whatever-library&gt;") but I don't see that in the submission rules so I'm wondering if I read that for some other assignment in another class.

  I'm thinking of using the 4x4 membrane touchpad sensor, and using the keypad library would make it a lot easier to do, so I figured I'd ask if that's okay!

  Yes, it is OK to use libraries as long as they are acknowledged.
