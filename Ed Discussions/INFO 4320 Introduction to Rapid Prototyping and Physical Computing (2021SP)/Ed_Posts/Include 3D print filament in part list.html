  I have two questions regarding filling out the parts list for the project.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1. We need many sets of wires for connecting motors. Should we include the wires in the purchase list or are we able to use materials in Rhodes?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. We are planning to 3D print some of our parts because we wanted to customize the dimensions. Should we include the filament for the 3D prints in the purchase list or is that provided?
 </paragraph>

  Thanks!

  You do not need to include the 3D printer filaments. We will order them for the entire class.

  You can check wires that are available in Rhodes 114, and try to reuse them. If you require wires that are different from the ones used in class, then you may want to order them separately.

  Please having your TA review the details of your order list for you in your weekly meeting.
