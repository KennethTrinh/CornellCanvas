 Hello,
 <break>
 </break>
 This is just a reminder that you should not forget to return the Multi-Meter and the Logic Analyzed to the lab so that we can use them for future versions of the class. Thanks.
</p>
<p>
 Also, every hardware or project box left in the labs after the end of May will be considered donated to the class hardware base. Please let us know if you might need more time to move them out of the labs.
</p>
<p>
 Francois.
