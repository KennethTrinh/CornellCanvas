  My LED light was working fine beforehand, but when I went to record today it stopped working. I checked the wires and the LED lightbulb but I wasn't sure what the issue was. What should I do? I didn't change or move any of the components.

  Yeah, but I commented it out and reverted back to the original code. The red user light was blinking just fine, just not the LED light.

  If you were able to have your code work for the integrated LED, this is problem with your hardware. It is often the case that things move around when you put your project in the box. Could you send us picture of your setting?
