 Hi Everyone,
</p>
<p>
 As we discussed at beginning of the semester, per requirements from the department and the university, we need to document when and who access the lab spaces (Rhodes 114, 110, 129). These steps are critical for us to maintain a healthy working lab environment given the challenges imposed by COVID-19.
</p>
<p>
 Please reserve the time slots before using the room and respect the time slots that you reserved. You need to leave the room and clean up the area once your time is up.  Even if you see no one is in the room, please check in and reserve the slots first before entering the room.
</p>
<p>
 This post including all the google sheets that you can use to reserver slots for the Laser cutter, 3D printer, 114, 110, and 129.
