  Hi Everyone,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thanks to our TA (Hyunchul) , who went to campus and moved all bags outside Gates (See pictures below). You can proceed and pick yours at your reserved slot. If your slot was in the morning, please reschedule another slot.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Please follow other requirements as mentioned in the original announcement (e.g., wearing masks, physical distancing, leave immediately after pick-up).
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  This bag of materials is only for Monday's class. Please also prepare tools that can be used to cut the tape and strings in advance.  (e.g., scissor, knife).
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  We will send another box of hardware once you officially enroll in the class next week.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Sorry again for the inconvenience.

  I just picked up my bag but looks like most of them got blown away or dumped out. I got one of the last ones still there.
