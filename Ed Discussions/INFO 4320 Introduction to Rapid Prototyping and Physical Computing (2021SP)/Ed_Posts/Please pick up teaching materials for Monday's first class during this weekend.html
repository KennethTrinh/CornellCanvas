  I tried to pick up a kit at 9 AM today, but the door was locked and my ID didnâ€™t help, even though I have been in Ithaca and compliant with COVID requirements for weeks. When should I expect the door to be open or accessible?

   Hi! I'm going to come back to campus tomorrow and  I won't be allowed to go on campus for the first 5 days. Is it possible to have someone else pick up my supplies for me?

    Sure. Just make sure to reserve a time slot and follow other rules as required.
   </p>
   <p>
    If no one can pick it up for you, that should be fine as well. We can pair you with others with the materials to work together.

     I'm returning to campus on February 15th, so would it be possible to also get paired up with someone?

      Feb 15 would be too late to form a project team.
     </p>
     <p>
      Forming a project team is one of the requirements to get the permit code to enroll in the class. We will have activities in the first class to help with this process. We will discuss more in Monday's class.
     </p>
     <p>
      I would encourage you to attend the first class, even if you only arrive on campus on the 15th.
     </p>

       Yes, sorry I was already planning to attend the first class, but I was asking about getting paired up with someone since I won't be able to get the physical materials mentioned in this announcement.

        I see.  We will help you to pair with others in the activities who have the physical materials in the first class.   You should be fine for the first class.
