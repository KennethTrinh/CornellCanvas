 I'm trying to print some items for our project, but each available printer I use begins the print without putting any filament down. So far I have tried printers 2, 4, and 5. Is this a problem with my gcode or the printers?

  It sounds like the printer is out of filament. Did you see filament is installed in the printer?

   Yes, there was filament in each of them. Printer 2 made about 50% of the brim of the design but very intermittently, and then used no filament as it continued, even with plenty on the wheel.

    This is weird. Do you mind share your design or gcode files?

     Do you have a picture of the print? And how did you generate the GCode you are printing? A couple of points:
    </p>
    <list style="bullet">
     <li>
      <p>
       P#2 printed something successfully late afternoon;
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       What you describe could happen if there is a mismatch between the slicer configuration and the actual printer;
      </p>
     </li>
    </list>

      I added a private note with my gcode, here’s a picture of the print after it stopped using filament. There was supposed to be more than just the three small rectangles. (The other two printers never made a brim like this.) I made my gcode by saving the body as an STL and importing it into PrusaSlicer, which is is how I’ve done it successfully in the past.

       Looking at this picture, one possible cause might be the amount of glue on the platform. You can clean it with warm water.

       But of course, this will not explain why it is not working on other printers. Not that P#5 is not a mini so the code generated for a mini will not work on this printer.

       Could you generate your piece on a regular Prusa and give a print a try?

        Sure, I'm heading into Rhodes soon so I'll try with a full size code + printer.

         I hope you were able to fix the problem.

         I was able to print on the full size printer (7), thanks! Having trouble with 6, though, I cleaned it off as much as I could but the first layer came out patchy again.
