 I was having the issue where scan for devices doesn't show any devices on Windows - the
 <a href="https://sigrok.org/doc/pulseview/0.4.1/manual.html#_windows">
  documentation for PulseView
 </a>
 talked about a program called Zadig which is installed alongside PulseView. Zadig allowed me to install the necessary drivers for the logic analyzer - unfortunately I don't know if there's an equivalent program on MacOS.

   I do not think that a driver is required on MacOS. So the first step will be to try the device with another USB cable.
