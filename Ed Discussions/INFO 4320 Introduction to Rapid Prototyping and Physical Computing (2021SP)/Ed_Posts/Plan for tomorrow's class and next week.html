  Hi Everyone,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I hope you all have enjoyed your wellness break. This week we will not have any mini project due.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  However, we will have one mini-project due next week. This mini-project will use the LED matrix and Keypad in your box.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  To reduce the workload for this mini-project next week, we will start working on it from tomorrow. The task in tomorrow's class will be wiring the LED matrix.
