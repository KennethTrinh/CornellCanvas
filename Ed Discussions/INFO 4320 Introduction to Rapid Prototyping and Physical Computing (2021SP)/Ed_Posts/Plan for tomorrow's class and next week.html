 Hi Everyone,
</p>
<p>
 I hope you all have enjoyed your wellness break. This week we will not have any mini project due.
</p>
<p>
 However, we will have one mini-project due next week. This mini-project will use the LED matrix and Keypad in your box.
</p>
<p>
 To reduce the workload for this mini-project next week, we will start working on it from tomorrow. The task in tomorrow's class will be wiring the LED matrix.
</p>
