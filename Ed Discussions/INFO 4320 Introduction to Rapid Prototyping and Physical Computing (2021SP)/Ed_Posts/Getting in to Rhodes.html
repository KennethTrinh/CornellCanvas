 My group and I wanted to come to Rhodes to finish up our project this morning, but it seems Rhodes 129 is locked. Can we get access /  does anyone know when it opens?

  Hello, It is my understanding that the door is quite hard to open. Could you check if the problem could be solved by pushing hardier than usual?

   Hi, after unlocking the door, can you push the door a little hard? For some reason, it needs some force to open it now
