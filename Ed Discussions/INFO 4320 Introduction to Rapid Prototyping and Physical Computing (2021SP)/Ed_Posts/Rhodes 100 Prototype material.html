 Hi, our group just got here at Rhodes hall to work on our low-fidelity prototype and cannot find any materials to work with. We found the box that has our team name on it with the face shields. The instructions say that there would be paper, cardboard, foam core, straw, wood skewer and so on to work with. Where can we find these things?

  Hi, I brought some scissors, tapes, papers and wood skewer to each rooms. Hope they would do! Regarding the cardboards, you can look for them in Rhodes 114. Also, you can bring some other tools available in Rhodes 114 as needed.
