  I recorded the video of my fan control sequence, but it's a little hard to see the Serial Monitor output as there's some glare and the screen is a little far. Should I try to re-record it or is it okay since we're also submitting a copy of the code?

  It would be better if you can retake the video with a higher quality of images. That would help the grading.

  Okay, also do we need to display the dots and dashes of the numbers to the serial monitor?
