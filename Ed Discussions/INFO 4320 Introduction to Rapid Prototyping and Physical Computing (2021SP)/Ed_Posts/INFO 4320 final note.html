 Hello,
 <break>
 </break>
 First, we wanted to thank you for a great semester and a great demo session last Saturday!
 <break>
 </break>
 <break>
 </break>
 I also wanted to clarify a couple of points before you leave campus:
</p>
<list style="bullet">
 <li>
  <p>
   we extended the cleaning lab assignment until the end of Thursday;
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   please return your kit's multimeter and logic analyzer with their lead and wires to Rhodes 114 ;
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   you can keep your prototype and all the components in your kit, but if you do not wish to keep some hardware please simply leave it in Rhodes 114 to be reused by future classes and student projects;
  </p>
 </li>
</list>
<p>
 Let us know if you have any questions!
</p>
<p>
 Have a great end of the semester.
</p>
<p>
 Francois.
