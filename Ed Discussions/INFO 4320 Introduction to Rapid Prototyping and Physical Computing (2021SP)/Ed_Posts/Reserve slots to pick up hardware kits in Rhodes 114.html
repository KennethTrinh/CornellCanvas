 Hi Everyone,
</p>
<p>
 TAs have put together the hardware kits for each of you and moved them all to Rhodes 114.
</p>
<p>
 If you have decided to take this course, you can go ahead and pick up your hardware kit in Rhodes 114.  We have requested access to the room for all of you. If you have problems in accessing the room, please let us know.
</p>
<p>
 The pickup process is highly similar to what we did in distributing the Marshmallow kit. Here is what you need to do :
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  1.
 </b>
 Reserve a time slot using the google sheet below:
</p>

 </a>
</p>

  2.
 </b>
 Show up on time to pick one bag, following all required health protocols, including, but not limited to
 <b>
  wearing face masks and keep physical distancing.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  If you see another student is picking the package in the room, please do not enter the area until that student complete the procedure and leave.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  If you are late for your reserved slot, please book another slot.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 Once you take your kit,
 <b>
  PLEASE LEAVE IMMEDIATELY. DO NOT STAY IN THE ROOM.
 </b>
</p>
<p>

 After taking the kit, filling your name in the second column to confirm:
 <link href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Irj8Wo1ubw9exfvyqorIcVgLGIcWdx_pBTi6fQ4LvA4/edit?usp=sharing"/>

</p>
<p>
 Please let us know if you have any questions.  Here are the pictures of where we placed the kits:

   If we're not back in Ithaca yet, can we have a friend pick up a kit for us?

    I would wait until you come back to pick up the kit.  We will hold the kit for you. Your friend also would not have access to Rhodes 114.

     Could we have a friend who's also taking the course pick it up for us? This means that they pick up both their kit and mine.

      That should be okay. If you send the name of your friend to both professors as the record.
