  Hi Everyone,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  We received several requests for an extension on Monday’s demo session, given the current resources crunch. We totally understand that this abnormal semester has been challenging for all of us. The COVID limitations have made working on hardware even more challenging. Unfortunately, we cannot delay providing feedback because upcoming wellness days will make it difficult for us to order any missing parts.

  As a compromise to address the current crunch on shared resources and the need to provide timely feedback to each group, we have decided not to grade Monday’s presentation. Instead, we will use Monday as an opportunity to provide feedback on your project and help you in any way we can.

    Do not crowd the rooms, since it is not graded. This presentation would not influence your final grade.

    We also decided to cancel the report (Due on Friday). Instead of writing the report, we will ask you to prepare a list of hardware that your team needs to finish your prototype. This order needs to be discussed and reviewed by your TA mentor. This list will be due at noon on Friday (11:59 AM).
