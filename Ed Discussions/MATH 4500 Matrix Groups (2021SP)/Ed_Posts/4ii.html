  For problem 4ii on the homework, I was wondering how dimension plays into the solving of this problem. It asks us to specifically consider a skew field with an odd dimension, but I do not see how dimension plays into the mapping/what the rest of the question is asking. Any hints would be appreciated! Thanks!

  The dimension will help you show that a

  eigenvalue must exist. A hint for the problem: You should be able to represent any linear map as a matrix multiplication.
