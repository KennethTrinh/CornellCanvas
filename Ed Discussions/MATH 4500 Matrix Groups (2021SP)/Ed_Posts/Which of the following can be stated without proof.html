  Which of the following statements can I assume without proof, if any?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1.) An invertible matrix can be expressed as a product of elementary matrices.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2.) An invertible matrix can be expressed as a product of elementary matrices where one elementary matrix multiplies the first row of the matrix it acts on by a constant, and all the other matrices in the product switch rows.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  3.) The determinant of an elementary matrix that switches rows is 1, and the determinant of an elementary matrix that multiplies a row by a constant a is a.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  4.) Also, can I assume that the general forms of the elementary matrices are known?

  </break>
  (Don't want to give too much away, so I haven't stated which question this pertains to, but hopefully it is clear to the instructors. If all of the statements above must be proved, is there a quicker way to do the problem, or is this on the right track?)

    This is a linear algebra result and may be used without proof.

    This is incorrect.

    The first of these assertions is incorrect.  Also, don't forget there is a third type of elementary matrix.

    Yes.

  Ah, yes I made a mistake in 2 and 3. I think 2.)  would be true if the end of the sentence said, "and all the other matrices in the product were matrices E_ij(a), where E_ij(a) adds a times the j-th row to the i-th row"
