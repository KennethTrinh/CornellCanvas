 Which of the following statements can I assume without proof, if any?
</p>
<p>
 1.) An invertible matrix can be expressed as a product of elementary matrices.
</p>
<p>
 2.) An invertible matrix can be expressed as a product of elementary matrices where one elementary matrix multiplies the first row of the matrix it acts on by a constant, and all the other matrices in the product switch rows.
</p>
<p>
 3.) The determinant of an elementary matrix that switches rows is 1, and the determinant of an elementary matrix that multiplies a row by a constant a is a.
</p>
<p>
 4.) Also, can I assume that the general forms of the elementary matrices are known?

 (Don't want to give too much away, so I haven't stated which question this pertains to, but hopefully it is clear to the instructors. If all of the statements above must be proved, is there a quicker way to do the problem, or is this on the right track?)
</p>

    This is a linear algebra result and may be used without proof.

    This is incorrect.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    The first of these assertions is incorrect.  Also, don't forget there is a third type of elementary matrix.
   </p>
  </li>

   <p>
    Yes.
   </p>
  </li>

   Ah, yes I made a mistake in 2 and 3. I think 2.)  would be true if the end of the sentence said, "and all the other matrices in the product were matrices E_ij(a), where E_ij(a) adds a times the j-th row to the i-th row"
