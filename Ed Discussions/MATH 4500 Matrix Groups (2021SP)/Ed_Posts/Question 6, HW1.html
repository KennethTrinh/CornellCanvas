 For part b of question 6, can we use the spectral theorem without proof? In general, is it ok to assume that results from linear algebra can be used without proof unless it is stated otherwise?

  Yes, you may use the spectral theorem (which we will review in class).

  Yes, you may use results from linear algebra without proof (but it is good practice to tell the reader when you are appealing to some known result).
