  Can we use the fact that x=−𝑗𝑥 ̄𝑗 if and only if x is a quaternion without proving it, since we proved it in homework 2?

  Sure.  You may use anything established in class or in previous homework.

  Within reasonable limits, it's a good idea to give references for the facts that you are using, e.g. "We use the fact established on hw 2 that $x=-j\bar{x}j$ if and only if $x$ is a quaternion".
