 Okay, so when we map the basis of some lie algebra to a vector space of our choice using a representation mapping, it seems we get some very interesting properties (at least for the sl(2) case we got some raising and lowering operators). This seemed to generalize a much more notion in quantum mechanics, where we work in Hilbert space and have all kinds of operators acting on our eigenbasis, including raising and lowering ones in the case of angular momentum and spin, which are clearly related to SO3 and SU2, respectively. However, even in some problems, such as the quantum harmonic oscillator, we get raising and lowering operators. I can imagine this is due to reformulating the problem in phase space and thinking of the configuration space as a manifold and considering this manifold as a lie group, which when we take the lie algebra and represent it in Hilbert space, we get our operators. My question is: can we always reformulate problems in such a way, and what conditions on these manifolds will give us these raising and lowering operators? Are there groups that will give us more interesting operators? If so, what would these have to look like?

 I hope this makes sense.

  A representation of $SU(2)$ or ($SO(3)$) on a vector space $V$ gives you one raising operator (corresponding to the element $E\in\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbf{C})$) and one lowering operator (corresponding to $F\in\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbf{C})$).

  A representation of a so-called reductive Lie group (which includes groups such as $SU(n)$, $U(n)$, $GL(n,\mathbf{C})$, $GL(n,\mathbf{R})$, $SO(n)$, but not the Heisenberg group) gives rise to a whole family of raising and lowering operators.  These raising and lowering operators make it possible to classify irreducible representations of reductive groups, similarly to the $SU(2)$-theory we discussed in class.
