 Given two Lie Algebras $g_1$ and $g_2$. Suppose we know these are isomorphic. Now consider an arbitrary Lie Algebra homomorphism $\phi:g_1 \rightarrow g_2$ induced by some Lie Group homomorphism of the respective algebras. Can we say anything about this $\phi$?

  Even though $\mathfrak{g}_1$ and $\mathfrak{g}_2$ are isomorphic, not every Lie algebra homomorphism $\phi\colon\mathfrak{g}_1\to\mathfrak{g}_2$ is an isomorphism.  For instance, $\phi$ could be the zero map.
