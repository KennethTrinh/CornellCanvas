  In lecture 33, we had the following proposition:
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  Proposition: Let g be a complex Lie algebra and g' a subset of g. Then g' is a real form of g if and only if g' is the fixed point set of an anti linear involution Lie algebra homomorphism y : g' â†’ g'.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  This is similar to the corresponding proposition for general vector spaces, except there is the added condition that we need the involution to be a Lie algebra homomorphism. Likewise, the definition of a real form of a Lie Algebra is similar to the definition of a real form of a general vector space, expect the real form of a Lie algebra must be closed under the bracket. Is the added condition that the involution be a Lie algebra homomorphism necessary to ensure closure under the bracket, and if so, why does the involution being a Lie algebra homomorphism imply closure under the bracket?

  Yes, the added condition that $\gamma$ be a Lie algebra homomorphism is there to ensure that the fixed-point space
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  $\mathfrak{g}_0=\{\,x\in\mathfrak{g}\mid\gamma(x)=x\,\}$
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  is a Lie subalgebra, i.e. a real linear subspace closed under the bracket.  This is shown as follows.  Since $\gamma$ is real linear, the set $\mathfrak{g}_0$, being the eigenspace of $\gamma$ for the eigenvalue $1$, is a real linear subspace of $\mathfrak{g}$.  Moreover, if $x$, $y\in\mathfrak{g}_0$, then $\gamma(x)=x$ and $\gamma(y)=y$, so
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  $\gamma([x,y])=[\gamma(x),\gamma(y)]=[x,y].$
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Therefore $[x,y]$ is in the fixed-point space of $\gamma$, i.e. $[x,y]\in\mathfrak{g}_0$.
