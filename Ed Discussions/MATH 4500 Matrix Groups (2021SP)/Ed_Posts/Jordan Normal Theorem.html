 Just out of curiosity, is the proof of the Jordan Normal form theorem difficult? It seems like a pretty useful (and a bit crazy) result, but we didn't cover the proof, whereas we did cover the proof of the spectral theorem for example, so I was wondering how difficult the proof is, and also if there's any specific versions or resources that explain it nicely.

  Found this online, I assume it's correct (though the latex in certain areas is messed up, so this might be a fun fill-in-the-blank proof exercise).
 </p>
 <p>
  I assume there are other proofs as well.

  The proof of the JNF theorem is a bit tricky.  It probably would have taken me a whole week and I didn't want to waste that much time on it.

  The web page referenced by Amogh looks a  little shaky to me.  You can find a detailed proof in Axler's Linear Algebra Done Right, which is available online through the Cornell library.
