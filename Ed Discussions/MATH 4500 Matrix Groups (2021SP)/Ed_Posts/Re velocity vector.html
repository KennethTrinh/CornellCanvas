 In lecture 28 : If a path is contained in a subspace, then the velocity vector of the path is also contained in the subspace.  Why? Did we cover it in the previous lectures?

  We did not cover it, but it is a fact from multivariable calculus.  Here is a proof.  Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional normed vector space and $\gamma\colon[a,b]\to V$ a path in $V$.  Suppose $\gamma$ is differentiable and that $\gamma(t)$ is contained in a linear subspace $W$ for all $t$.  Then
 </p>
 <p>
  $$\frac1h(\gamma(t+h)-\gamma(t))\in W$$
 </p>
 <p>
  for all $t$ and $h$, so $\gamma'(t)=\lim_{h\to0}\frac1h(\gamma(t+h)-\gamma(t))\in W$ for all $t$, because a linear subspace of a finite-dimensional normed vector space is always closed.
