  Can we expect the exam length to be similar to that of the practice problems? That is, can we treat the practice problems as a "practice prelim" that we should complete in 50 mins?

  Additionally, in the practice problems, like the homeworks, you provide us with a definition of a group after it is mentioned (like Problem 1 of the practice). Can we expect this to hold on the exam?

  The practice exam is perhaps a bit longer than what you can complete in 50 minutes.

  On the exam I won't necessarily repeat any definitions or review standard notation.  For example, I expect you to know what $\mathbf{GL}(n,\mathbf{C})$ or $\mathbf{GL}(n,\mathbf{R})$ means.
