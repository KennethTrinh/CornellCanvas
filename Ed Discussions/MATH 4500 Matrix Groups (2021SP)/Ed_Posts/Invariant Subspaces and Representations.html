 Today in Office Hours, we talked about how if W is a G-invariant subspace, then W is a representation of G. I was having trouble finding this in the notes and was wondering what theorem this came from. Thanks!

  If $\Pi\colon G\to\operatorname{GL}(V)$ is a representation and $W$ is an invariant subspace of $V$, then we get a representation $\Pi_W$ of $G$ on $W$ by defining $\Pi_W(A)w=\Pi(A)w$ for $w\in W$ and $A\in G$.  This is well-defined because $\Pi(A)w\in W$ for all $w\in W$.  We call the representation $\Pi_W\colon G\to\operatorname{GL}(W)$ the
  <i>
   restriction
  </i>
  of $\Pi$ to $W$.
