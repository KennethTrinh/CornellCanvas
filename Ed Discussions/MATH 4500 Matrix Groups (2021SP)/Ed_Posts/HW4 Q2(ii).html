 To determine that
</p>
<math>
 \det_R\left(M_Z\right)=\left|\det_C\left(Z\right)\right|^2
</math>
<p>
 is there some way of getting the determinant of block matrix, or is there some other approach to use?
</p>

  A direct approach using formulas for determinants is likely to be clumsy.  I suggest an indirect approach using some linear algebra.  It's useful to distinguish two cases.
 </p>
 <p>
  Case 1.  $\det(Z)=0$.  Can you somehow show that $\det(M_Z)$ is also $0$?
 </p>
 <p>
  Case 2.  $\det(Z)\ne0$.  What are some facts you know about matrices with nonzero determinant?
