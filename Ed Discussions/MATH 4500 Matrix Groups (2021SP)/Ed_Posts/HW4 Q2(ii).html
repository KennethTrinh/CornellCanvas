  A direct approach using formulas for determinants is likely to be clumsy.  I suggest an indirect approach using some linear algebra.  It's useful to distinguish two cases.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Case 1.  $\det(Z)=0$.  Can you somehow show that $\det(M_Z)$ is also $0$?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Case 2.  $\det(Z)\ne0$.  What are some facts you know about matrices with nonzero determinant?
