 For question 5b on the homework, do we need to explicitly definite a path
 <b>
  Î»(t),
 </b>
 or is it sufficient to show that a path exists through connectedness using the result from part A?

  (Path) Connectedness is indeed the underlying issue here.
 </p>
 <p>
  But why is the complement of a finite number of points in the complex plane a connected set?  I want you to come up with an argument, and the easiest argument I can come up with involves a fairly explicit construction of a path between the points 0 and 1.
