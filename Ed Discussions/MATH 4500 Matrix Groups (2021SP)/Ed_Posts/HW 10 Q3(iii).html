<p>
 Is  "Pi is completely reducible" the same as "V is completely reducible" ?  If not, what is the difference between them?
</p>
<p>
 What does "P(V) ~P(V') as representations of T_0" mean in HW 10 Q3(iii)
</p>
<p>
 Thank you in advance.

  Yes.   If $\Pi\colon G\to\operatorname{GL}(V)$ is a representation of a group $G$ on a vector space $V$, sometimes we are sloppy and say "$V$ is a representation of $G$".
