 For question 1, part I, I'm struggling to figure out how the exponential equation yields the commutator relationship. For [X,Y]=Z, I was able to do some differentiation to show that, but I can't seem to get the other two expressions through similar means. Any suggestions?

  Professor said he is going to remove part 1 of problem 1. So let's wait for him to make the formal announcement.
