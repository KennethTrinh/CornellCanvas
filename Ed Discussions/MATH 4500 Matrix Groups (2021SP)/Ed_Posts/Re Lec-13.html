  Professor,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  In today's lecture, in order to get the R_j in the form you wrote in the lecture notes,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  should we write:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <italic>
   w_j= a_j + i*b_j,  instead of w_j= a_j - i* b_j   ?
  </italic>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I think the sign before
  <italic>
   i*b_j  is important
  </italic>
  because it will impact the sign of sin in
  <italic>
   R_j.  Please correct me if I am wrong.
  </italic>
 </paragraph>

  Different people use different conventions.  If you choose $w_j=a_j-ib_j$ then the matrix $R_j$ is
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  $$R_j=\begin{pmatrix}\cos\theta_j&amp;-\sin\theta_j\\\sin\theta_j&amp;\cos\theta_j\end{pmatrix}.$$
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If you choose $w_j=a_j+ib_j$ then the matrix $R_j$ is
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  $$R_j=\begin{pmatrix}\cos\theta_j&amp;\sin\theta_j\\-\sin\theta_j&amp;\cos\theta_j\end{pmatrix}.$$
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Once you make a choice, it is best to stick to it.  Both conventions say that the matrix $R_j$ represents a rotation through $\theta_j$ in the plane spanned by $a_j$ and $b_j$.  But I prefer the first convention, because it says that the rotation is positive (counterclockwise) with respect to the oriented basis $a_j$, $b_j$.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Incidentally, one thing I forgot to mention in lecture is that the vectors $a_j$ and $b_j$ are orthogonal but not normalized: we have $\|a_j\|=\|b_j\|=1/\sqrt2$, so we have to multiply both by $\sqrt2$ to get an orthonormal basis.
