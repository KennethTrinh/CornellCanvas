  I'm a little confused by the wording for the definition of "center" in question 2.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Question 2 says: "The center of a group G is the subset Z(G) consisting of all g in G with the property that gh=hg for all h in G. "
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Could someone clarify this? Thanks!

 <paragraph>
  If $g$ and $h$ are elements of a group $G$, we say that $g$
  <italic>
   commute
  </italic>
  s with $h$ if $gh=hg$.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  So an element is in the center of $G$ if and only if it commutes with every element of $G$.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If $G$ is commutative, then every element commutes with every other, so $Z(G)=G$.  But if $G$ is not commutative, the center can be very much smaller than $G$.
