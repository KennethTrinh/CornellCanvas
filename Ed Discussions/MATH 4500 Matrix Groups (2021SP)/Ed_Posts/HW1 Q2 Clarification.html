 I'm a little confused by the wording for the definition of "center" in question 2.
</p>
<p>
 Question 2 says: "The center of a group G is the subset Z(G) consisting of all g in G with the property that gh=hg for all h in G. "
</p>
<p>
 Could someone clarify this? Thanks!
</p>

 <p>
  If $g$ and $h$ are elements of a group $G$, we say that $g$
  <i>
   commute
  </i>
  s with $h$ if $gh=hg$.
 </p>
 <p>
  So an element is in the center of $G$ if and only if it commutes with every element of $G$.
 </p>
 <p>
  If $G$ is commutative, then every element commutes with every other, so $Z(G)=G$.  But if $G$ is not commutative, the center can be very much smaller than $G$.
