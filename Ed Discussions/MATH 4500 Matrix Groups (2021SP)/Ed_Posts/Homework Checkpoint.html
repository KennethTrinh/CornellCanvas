  After the prelim, a rough guideline was released that allowed us to figure out how we were doing in the class. Could we perhaps get another rough guideline like that (maybe after this week's homework is graded) ?

  Let H be the sum of your highest six homework scores (out of homework assignments 1–8) and let P be your prelim score. (H is a number between 0 and 120, and P is a number between 0 and 50.) Let S=(5/12)×H+(1/2)×P be your "subtotal" score. Your subtotal S is a number between 0 and 75. The quartiles of the subtotal score distribution are Q1 61.7, Q2 64.3, Q3 69.5.
 </paragraph>

  Instructions for estimating your letter grade: if your subtotal S is less than 50, you earn a C+ or less; if S is between 50 and 65 you earn between a B- and a B+; if S is greater than 65, you earn an A- or more. This is a rough estimate only; your grade can still change between now and the end of the course.
