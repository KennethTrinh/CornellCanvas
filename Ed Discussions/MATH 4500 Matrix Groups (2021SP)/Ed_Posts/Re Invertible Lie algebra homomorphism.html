 When is a Lie algebra homomorphism invertible? Do you only need to check "onto"?

<p>
 Thank you, Professor.

  A Lie algebra homomorphism is a special kind of linear map, so the usual criteria for invertibility hold.
 </p>
 <p>
  For a linear map $T\colon V\to W$ to be invertible it must be onto and have trivial kernel (null-space).  If you know that $V$ and $W$ are finite-dimensional and of the same dimension, then it is enough to check either that $T$ is onto or that $T$ has trivial kernel.
