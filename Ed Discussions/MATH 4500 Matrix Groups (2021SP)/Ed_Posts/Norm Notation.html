 I've noticed that in class we have used different notation for norm. Today, we used $|x|$ for quaternionic norm but previously we had written other norms as $||x||$. Is there a rule for when we should use $|x|$ versus $||x||$?

  There is no hard and fast rule.  Different authors use different conventions.

  I generally use $\|x\|$ for the norm of a vector $x$ in a normed vector space $V$, but in the special case where $V$ is a division algebra and the norm is multiplicative (norm of the product is equal to the product of the norms), I usually write $|x|$.
