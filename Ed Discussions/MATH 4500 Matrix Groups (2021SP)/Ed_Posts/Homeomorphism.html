 Can I use the following two facts on the homework? We did not cover them, but other courses I have taken have covered them.
 <break>
 </break>
 <break>
 </break>
 1.) Heine Borell Theorem
 <break>
 </break>
 2.) Homeomorphisms preserve topological properties.
 <break>
 </break>
 <break>
 </break>
 (Also, is it ok if I use some other very basic notions from topology, such as the fact that the complement of an open set is a closed set by definition, etc? )
</p>

  We covered several basic notions of topology in class, and in principle these should suffice to do the homework.  If you want to use some other basic notions covered in other classes, that is OK too.
