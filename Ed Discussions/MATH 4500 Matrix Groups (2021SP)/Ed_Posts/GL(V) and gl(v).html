 I know that GL(V)={A: V--&gt;V| A is linear and invertible}, gl(V)={A: V--&gt;V| A is linear}.
</p>
<p>
 But I do not understand that "gl(V) forms a Lie algebra under the bracket [x, y]= xy-yx."
</p>
<p>
 What does the sentence in the previous quote in mean? Does it mean that all the linear maps in gl(V) have to satisfy the Lie bracket?
</p>

  If $f$ and $g$ are two linear maps from $V$ to $V$, then we can compose $f$ and $g$ both ways: $f\circ g$ and $g\circ f$ are both well-defined linear maps.  We
  <i>
   define
  </i>
  the bracket of $f$ and $g$ to be the difference,
 </p>
 <p>
  $[f,g]=f\circ g-g\circ f.$
 </p>
 <p>
  This bracket makes $\mathfrak{gl}(V)$ a Lie algebra.
 </p>
 <p>
  If we choose a basis $v_1,v_2,\dots,v_n$ of $V$, we can represent $f$ and $g$ by $n\times n$-matrices $A$ and $B$.  Then $f\circ g$ is represented by the matrix $AB$, so the bracket $[f,g]$ is represented by the matrix
 </p>
 <p>
  $[A,B]=AB-BA$.

   By definition, a Lie algebra is a vector space equipped with a Lie bracket that satisfies the usual conditions. I think the sentence in the quotation just means that if you take the vector space gl(V) and give it the structure of a Lie bracket, you get what we call a Lie algebra.

   I'm not sure what it would mean for a linear map to "satisfy the bracket".
