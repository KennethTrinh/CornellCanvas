  Hi Professor,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  About the last slide of the Lec-14,  should the green line be "r_B(t) in H_0" instead of "r_B(t) in H" ?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I am confused. Thank you for your clarification

  Recall the definition: the path component of $I$ consists of all $h\in H$ for which there exists a path $\delta\colon[0,1]\to H$ with $\delta(0)=I$, $\delta(1)=h$.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  $\gamma_B$ is a path in $H$ which starts at $I$ and ends at $B$.  Therefore $B$ is in the path component of $I$, which was to be proved.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  You are right that it then follows that $\gamma_B(t)\in H_0$ for all $t$.
