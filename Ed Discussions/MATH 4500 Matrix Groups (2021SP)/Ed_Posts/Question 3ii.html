  1.) In question 3ii, does "real linear subspace" mean a subspace where the entries in the matrices can be complex, but the scalar multiplication is done only using real scalars? It doesn't seem to be true if the scalars can be complex.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2.) Is the algebra of quaternions an inner product space ?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  3.) When we look at the group M(n, F), F means that the entires in M
  <italic>
   and
  </italic>
  the scalars in the scalar multiplication are from the field F, correct?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  4.) On the homework it says, "We identify a real number ùëé with the matrix ùëé1Ùè∞∫‚ààH". I took this to mean that an italicized letter refers to such a matrix. However, in iii.), ùë¶ is not necessarily such a matrix, right? (If it were, xy would equal yx for all x and y).

    Yes.  There is an inner product on the algebra of quaternions for which the associated norm is $|x|=\sqrt{x^*x}$.

    $M(n,\mathbf{F})$ is not a group, but a vector space (in fact an algebra) over the field $\mathbf{F}$.  The entries of the matrices in $M(n,\mathbf{F})$ are in $\mathbf{F}$.  We can scalar multiply such matrices by scalars from $\mathbf{F}$.

    No, $y$ is an arbitrary quaternion.
