 For this course, is it okay to use logical notation in proofs? For example, may we use the "for all" quantifier, the arrow for "if," and three dots for "therefore." Or is simple English preferred?

  I don't mind an occasional $\forall$ or $\implies$, but prose festooned with logical symbols is hard to read, so on the whole simple English is preferred.
