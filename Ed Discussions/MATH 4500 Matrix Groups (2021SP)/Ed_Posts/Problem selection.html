 Are the problems graded for accuracy on the homeworks randomly selected, or chosen? I'm asking out of curiosity (still planning on doing all the problems to the best of my ability).

  The selection is not random.  I'd prefer to have all the problems graded, but that is unfortunately impossible.  We have only one grader and University policy imposes limits on their work hours.
