  3iii begins with:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  "We have 𝑖^2 =𝑗^2 =𝑘^2 =−1, 𝑖𝑗=−𝑗𝑖=𝑘, 𝑗𝑘=−𝑘𝑗=𝑖, 𝑘𝑖=−𝑖𝑘=𝑗"
 </paragraph>

  Do you want us to verify/prove this, or should we only prove the statements following this?

  We will return to quaternions in class and in future homework.  We will freely use the properties listed in this problem, so please make sure you understand what's going on.
