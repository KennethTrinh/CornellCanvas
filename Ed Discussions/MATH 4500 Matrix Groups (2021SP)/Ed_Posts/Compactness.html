 In past courses, I have seen compactness defined as follows: The set A is compact if any open cover of A has a finite sub-cover. The fact that closed and bounded sets are compact has followed as a result that had to be proved - for example, in analysis, this follows from Heine Borel. Are we defining compactness differently, or just making use of the result that closed and bounded presumably coincides with the usual definition of compactness in all the instances that concern us? In general though, it is true that there are topological spaces and metric spaces that are closed and bounded, but not compact, no?

  Your definition of compactness is the correct one for general topological spaces.

  The Heine-Borel theorem says that a subset of a
  <i>
   finite-dimensional
  </i>
  normed vector space (such as $\mathbf{R}^n$) is compact if and only if it is bounded.  I used this theorem as a definition to simplify our lives.

  The notion of boundedness does not make sense for a general topological space, but it does for a metric space.  Yes, there exist metric spaces in which closed and bounded subsets are not compact.  For instance, the unit ball in an infinite-dimensional normed vector space is closed and bounded, but never compact!
