  Hi everyone,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I'm including Ed Discussion in INFO 6940: Rural Computing and Rural Infrastructure as a place for outside-of-class, asynchronous group discussion. Feel free to post related news or articles you see elsewhere, and ask questions or bring up topics related to our course. You can also reach me privately through Ed Discussion if you want to connect personally.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For more information on Ed Discussion, you can refer to the
  <link href="https://edstem.org/quickstart/ed-discussion.pdf"/>
  Quick Start Guide.

  Looking forward to seeing you all soon,
 </paragraph>

  Phoebe
