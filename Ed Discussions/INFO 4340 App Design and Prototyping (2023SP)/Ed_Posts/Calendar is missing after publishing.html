 I have a question about publish. I published the prototype to the github page but it seems that the whole calendar can't show up and there are some errors. But there is no error when i run the code locally. How can i fix this problem?

  do you use 'this' inside of the template tag when accessing 'overlay'? not sure the reason why publishing breaks this functionality. but i encountered it w my project.
