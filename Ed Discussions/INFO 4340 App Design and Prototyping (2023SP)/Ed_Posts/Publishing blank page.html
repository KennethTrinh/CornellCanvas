 During class on Thursday, I was able to follow the steps to get the example repo's boilerplate Vite content to show up on Github Pages.
</p>
<p>
 However, when attempting to replicate the steps on our final project repo, I was unable to get anything besides a blank page to show up on GitHub Pages. I followed the instructions of switching the build source to 'main' and back to 'gh-pages', but that did not work either.
</p>
<p>
 I was wondering if someone could provide some insight into what I could do to diagnose or resolve the issue.

  GitHub provides us very little to debug. It's very frustrating. I often find that I need to publish a branch with just a README.md and then try and republish my app if everything else fails. I hope this helps!
