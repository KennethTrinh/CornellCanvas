  During class on Thursday, I was able to follow the steps to get the example repo's boilerplate Vite content to show up on Github Pages.

  However, when attempting to replicate the steps on our final project repo, I was unable to get anything besides a blank page to show up on GitHub Pages. I followed the instructions of switching the build source to 'main' and back to 'gh-pages', but that did not work either.

  I was wondering if someone could provide some insight into what I could do to diagnose or resolve the issue.

  GitHub provides us very little to debug. It's very frustrating. I often find that I need to publish a branch with just a README.md and then try and republish my app if everything else fails. I hope this helps!
