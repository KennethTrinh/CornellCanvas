  Problems # 1 and 2
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For # 1, the handout says we should sort the results so that the
  <underline>
   oldest
  </underline>
  years come first and so that, within each year, countries that come earlier in the alphabet come first, but the sample screenshot does not follow this, which sorts the results by year from oldest to newest:

 </figure>
 <paragraph>
  For # 2, the handout says
 </paragraph>
 <list style="unordered">
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    population_in_millions: the population of the country in millions, rounded to 1 digit of precision
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
 </list>
 <paragraph>
  But the screenshot given did not do this:

 <paragraph>
  The order also does not match the handout.

  Thanks. Sorry about the typos in the screenshots. They are corrected in the most recent version of the homework.

  In general, do the problem that is described in the words in the problem set. If there is a discrepancy with the screenshot, then ask, which is what you did.

  I have also updated the screenshot requested in your solution to conform to what the question asks.
