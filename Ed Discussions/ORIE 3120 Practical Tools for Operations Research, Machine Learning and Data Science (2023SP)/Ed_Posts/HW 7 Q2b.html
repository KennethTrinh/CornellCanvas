 Problem #2b
</p>
<p>
 HW #7
</p>
<p>
 I know for 2b in HW 7, it says to "do the same" as in part a but this time with B=0. However, if we are already setting B=0 from the beginning, do we not need to create a plot of Type I error vs B like we did for part a? Essentially, are we trying to plot Type I error vs. B[0.1....1] like part a) or do we just want the Type I error from 1000 simulations when we have B=0?

  You just want the Type I error from 1000 simulations when B=0. This would be a number.
