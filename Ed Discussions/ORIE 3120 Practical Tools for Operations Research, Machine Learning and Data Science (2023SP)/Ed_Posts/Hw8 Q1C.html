 Problem #1
</p>
<p>
 HW #8
</p>
<p>
 Running 1mil models takes an incredibly long time. I create the uniform distribution of 1mil numbers. I then take each one compared to Y to see if the coef is &lt;= 0.8 to meet the constraint. Then I remove all that don't meet the constraint. Then run all of them against Z.
</p>
<p>
 The code takes incredibly long to run through 1mil models so I am just wondering if I am taking the wrong approach to this.
