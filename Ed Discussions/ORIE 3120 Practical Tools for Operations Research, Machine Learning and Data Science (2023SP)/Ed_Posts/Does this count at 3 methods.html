 Hi, I wonder if the following counts as using "three data analysis methods learned in class":
</p>
<list style="bullet">
 <li>
  <p>
   We fitted a naive OLS model and explored everything based on the naive model (method 1: linear regression)
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   We explored the assumptions of linear regression and looked at LOWESS line, autocorrelation, and QQ plot (method 2: linearity of linear assumption)
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   We use train/test split to compute MSE for each model and decide which models (e.g. naive, log-transformed, square rooted) to use (method 3: train/test split)
  </p>
 </li>
</list>
<p>
 Thank you!
</p>
