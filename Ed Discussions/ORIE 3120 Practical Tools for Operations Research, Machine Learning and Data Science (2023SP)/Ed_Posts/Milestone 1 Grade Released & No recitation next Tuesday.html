  We have released the grading and TA's comments on your milestone 1 in CMT. It should be under the review for 'meta-reviewer.' We will also add one regrade point to every report, which is currently not added to the score you see on CMT. There might be one report we have not added the comment, but it should be there shortly.

 <paragraph>
  Let me know if you cannot see the comments.

 <paragraph>
  And there is no recitation next Tuesday.
