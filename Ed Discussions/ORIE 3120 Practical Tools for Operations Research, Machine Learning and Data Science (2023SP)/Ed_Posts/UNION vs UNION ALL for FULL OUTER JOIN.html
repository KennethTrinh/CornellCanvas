 Lecture 6 slide 25:
</p>
<p>
 I'm not understanding why
</p>
<p>
 <i>
  A full outer join B
 </i>
</p>
<p>
 is equivalent to
</p>
<p>
 <i>
  [A left join B] UNION ALL [A right join B]
 </i>
</p>
<p>
 instead of
</p>
<p>
 <i>
  [A left join B] UNION [A right join B]
 </i>
</p>
<p>
 since it is stated that UNION ALL does not remove the duplicates.

  Good question.  I think the case that you are referring to is that  B table has two exactly the same records. In that case, when you do the union after you right-join or left-join, you will have some duplicate records. But in that case, the
  <code>
   Full Outer Join
  </code>
  will also return two duplicate records, since each record in B (even though they are duplicate) is treated differently.  In other words, you need to collect everything from either Table A and Table B for a
  <code>
   Full Outer Join
  </code>
  and
  <code>
   Union All
  </code>
  is still needed.
