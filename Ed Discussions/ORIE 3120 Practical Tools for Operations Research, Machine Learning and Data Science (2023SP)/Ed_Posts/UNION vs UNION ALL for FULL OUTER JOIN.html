 <paragraph>
  I'm not understanding why
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <italic>
   A full outer join B
  </italic>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  is equivalent to
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <italic>
   [A left join B] UNION ALL [A right join B]
  </italic>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  instead of
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <italic>
   [A left join B] UNION [A right join B]
  </italic>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  since it is stated that UNION ALL does not remove the duplicates.

  Good question.  I think the case that you are referring to is that  B table has two exactly the same records. In that case, when you do the union after you right-join or left-join, you will have some duplicate records. But in that case, the
  <code>
   Full Outer Join
  </code>
  will also return two duplicate records, since each record in B (even though they are duplicate) is treated differently.  In other words, you need to collect everything from either Table A and Table B for a
  <code>
   Full Outer Join
  </code>
  and
  <code>
   Union All
  </code>
  is still needed.
