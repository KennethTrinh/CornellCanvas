 I'm a little confused how to answer this question. Is the length of the line segment equal to the sum of squared residuals since the line segment is saying how far the observed point is from the estimated point? Any help is appreciated, thank you!

  You are minimizing the sum of squared residuals by running the regression. The line segment is how far the observed point is from the estimated point. That is the definition of residual in linear regression.
