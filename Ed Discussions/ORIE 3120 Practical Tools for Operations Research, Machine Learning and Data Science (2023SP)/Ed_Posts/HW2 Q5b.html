 Problem # 5b
</p>
<p>
 HW #2
</p>
<p>
 Here the bracket on the right is round bracket, which means we should exclude the value 5 when we are counting for the interval with center 0. However, for the picture in part b, there are two points for interval with center 0. Is this some typo?
</p>
<p>
 This problem also happens to 35 when I calculated in SQL, so it seems like a general problem with whether we should consider 5 as in the interval or not.

  Yes, you seem to be right. based on the example provided you should include points on the "upper bound" of the interval. I would go by the query that matches up with the example image.

   Thanks a lot for answering my question! Just to make sure, does that mean we need to include the number on the upper bound as the example image shows?

    How can we make sql round .5 down to get the result given in the example image?

     To add to this, be careful that you don't bin the rounded unit prices, you should only bin the unit prices. For example, the occurrence of the roundedunitprice of 5 has a unit price of 4.5, which should be in bin center 0. But the occurrence of the roundedunitprice of 55 has a unit price of 55, which should be in bin center 60 (according to the original binning scheme).
