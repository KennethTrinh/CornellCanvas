 I had group by statements before, but in troubleshooting decided to test if the columns were even loading. They're not, and I can't figure out the issue. View q3a loads just fine.

  I would go back to your q3a and make sure all of your changes are committed and your joins are correct. If q3a loads fine, this should also load fine.
