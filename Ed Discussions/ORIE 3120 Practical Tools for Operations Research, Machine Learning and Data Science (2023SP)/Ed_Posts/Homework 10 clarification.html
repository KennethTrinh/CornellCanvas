 Some clarification of homework 10:
</p>
<list style="bullet">
 <li>
  <p>
   For question 4, we will accept both cu = 10 and cu = 15.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   For question 6, if you set
   <b>
    3 * round(A + B * probability_of_rain)
   </b>
   as the number of eggs, you should use
   <b>
    round(A + B * probability_of_rain),
   </b>
   which is the number of sandwiches in your randomized research. This is because the demand is given in the number of sandwiches instead of the number of eggs.
  </p>
 </li>
</list>
<p>
 Let us know if there is any other confusion.

  for q6, is it okay to keep
  <b>
   3 * round(A + B * probability_of_rain)
  </b>
  as the number of eggs and then multiply demand by 3.

   You could. But the overage cost and underage cost will also change. And it is not very clear for me now how that would proceed

     Sorry, another question. Does each sandwich cost $0.75 or each egg cost $0.75?
