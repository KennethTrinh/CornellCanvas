 Since there are often several ways to produce the same result in SQL, I was wondering if my answer to 1G was another correct way to solve it:
</p>
<p>
 SELECT T1.StudentID, T1.Day, (T2.Day - T1.Day) AS Gap FROM Tests AS T1 INNER JOIN Tests AS T2 ON T1.StudentID = T2.StudentID WHERE T1.Day &lt; T2.Day
</p>
<p>
 Thanks!

  I don't think so since it may also return (Day, Gap) = (2, 8), (2, 10), (5, 7).
