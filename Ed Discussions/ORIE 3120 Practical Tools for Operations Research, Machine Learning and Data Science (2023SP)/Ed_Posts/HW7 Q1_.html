  HW # 7
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I tried to create a model based on the instructions given in question 1.  But when I count and compute the fraction of the time that the confidence interval contains beta1 for part a, I always get a ratio of 1 instead of 0.95. It might be because of some confusion in the set up.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I already created X and epsilon using np.random.randn(100). My question is that when I create my Y, I have to add the array of X values, the epsilon array, and another array filled with 1's together to get Y right? And once I do that, I need to add a constant to the X array since this model contains an intercept?

  Yes, use np.random.randn(100) to generate x and epsilon!
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Define y, create your linear regression model, add a constant, and then evaluate the confidence intervals.

  I tried doing that, and I already checked that the values I'm pulling from the model summary are correct. I'm still getting a ratio of 1 every time. Is that supposed to happen?

  I'm running into the same issue. Did you ever figure out the issue?

  I went to another TA's office hours and it turns out that we aren't supposed to add a constant to X once you add the ones to Y. Hope this helps!

  Also running into the same issues, do you mean taht we should do
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  model = sm.OLS(yi, (xi)).fit()
  <break>
  </break>
  instead of
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  model = sm.OLS(yi, sm.add_constant(xi)).fit()
  <break>
  </break>

  Yes just use model = sm.OLS(yi, (xi)).fit().

  Hi. I am running into the same issue as well. Whether I add a constant or not as in both of these examples, my code still gives me a ratio of 1.0.

  Also another issue that I had in my code was that the beta1 value that we should be checking with the confidence interval is 1.  This is based on the equation Y that we are given as Y = 1 + X + epsilon shows that the coefficient for X or beta1 is 1. But I'm not sure if you have the same issue though.

  You should be getting a number that reflects a 95% CI.
