  Hi!
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I did the recitation on my own and was just wondering what to submit. The doc says to submit the .txt file but thats not an acceptable submission format on Gradescope. Do you just want a screenshot of the .txt file or should we be converting it to a pdf? Wondering what the preference is.

  Converting it to pdf is preferred.
