  LTRIM will remove the specified characters from the LEFT side of the string. Since the left side of the string is 'O...' and does not contain any characters in '3120', these characters will not be removed. Ltrim will trim all characters in the specified string to trim until another character on the left is seen.

  If it was ORIE3120 without a space, would that remove?

  I still don't get why... cuz it says 'RO' would yield IE 3120. Why would RO work then if 3120 does not work..

  You're going to trim characters on the left side as long as they are in the second argument. So if the second argument was 'RO', we would trim an O (since it's an O or R), then we trim the R (since it's an O or R), but we don't trim the I (since it's neither an O nor an R). Therefore, the trimmed string is IE 3120.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If the second argument of LTRIM was '3120', we keep trimming characters as long as they are a 0, 1, 2, or 3. The first character of 'ORIE 3120' (O) is neither a 0, 1, 2, nor a 3, so nothing gets trimmed in this case.

  3120 would need to be on the left side of the string for it to remove it
