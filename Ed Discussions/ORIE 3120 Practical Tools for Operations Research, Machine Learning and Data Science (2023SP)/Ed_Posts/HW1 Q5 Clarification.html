 "Explain how many records your query would return if a single record were added to the poverty table with the following values"
</p>
<p>
 By explain, do you mean just give the number or explain why it returns that number? Also, each bullet point is a separate query or are they supposed to stack on top of each other?

  You should briefly explain why it returns that number, and all the bullet points should be entered as one data point (one row).
