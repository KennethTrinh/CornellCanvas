  Can you clarify what it means when the SAT score is replaced by a normalized version?  Is this the correct formula below to use?

  Hi Daron,
  <break>
  </break>
  This would give you scores between 0 and 1 for everyone (try different values of X given some Xmin and Xmax). What you want instead is a normal(ish) distribution where the mean is 0 and the standard deviation is 1 (this can give negative scores, think of situations when you say "I'm x standard deviations above/below the mean" - this x is the number you want.
  <break>
  </break>
  Hope this helps!

  In the homework it gives you the normalized formula
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  normalized version of Xi :  Xâ€™i = (Xi-m) / s
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  m = mean
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  s = stardard deviation
