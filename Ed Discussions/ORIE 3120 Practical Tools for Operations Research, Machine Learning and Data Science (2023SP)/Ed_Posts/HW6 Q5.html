 Problem #5
</p>
<p>
 HW #6
</p>
<p>
 I'm confused about how to start question5.
</p>
<p>
 When it says to plot the set, am I making 2 linear regression models? This is what I did but this seems to not be working.
</p>
<p>
 What exactly are we trying to do here?

  You are only fitting one model. You have 2 datapoints (X,Y) given in the question, Fit the model on these points. Y hat is then the prediction given by the model for each of the x points. Plotting the set means you plot both pairs of points and run a model on this.
