 Problem #3c
</p>
<p>
 HW #4
</p>
<p>
 For the view below, am I supposed to get 1 aggregate value or is it supposed to be grouped by CustID or OrderID or something else?
</p>
<p>
 Create a view, Q3c, that uses Q3b to calculate the number of EO orders placed by each dealership (i.e., the number of OrderIDs with OrderType EO). It should return two fields: CustID and NumEO. If a dealership did not place any EO orders, it won’t appear in the view’s results.

  You should be grouping by CustID.
