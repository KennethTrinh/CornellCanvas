  My Tuesday (3.28) recitation (extended office hour) this week has slight changes due to a department event. I will start at 2 and leave at 3:30, then back at 4:40 and stay until 5). This won't affect other TA's schedule. If you have questions regarding prelims, feel free to come.

 <paragraph>
  For office hours during spring break, please check the calendar for the updated time. They are aimed for the project and you need to sign up a 15min time slot in the "ORIE3120 project teams meeting" sheet.
