  I'm honestly not sure how to even approach this question. Also, are there specific terms that we should have in our answer? It seems to me that beta-0 and beta-1 would be the same (just that the x-bar, y-bar, etc. would have different meanings)

  However in this question your averages are instead

   weighted averages

  . Substitute weighted averages in instead of unweighted.
