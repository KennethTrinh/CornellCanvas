  Should we add a constant to the logit models in question 1? The coefficients seem to be very different with and without a constant and I am unsure of when it is needed.

  You should always add constant unless it is specified in the question. One way to see it is that adding a constant will strictly improve your prediction because if you set the coefficient for the constant to be 0, it is equivalent to the model without a constant.

  Also, the true model for this question (assuming you are talking about hw8 Q1) has non-zero $\hat{\beta}_0$
