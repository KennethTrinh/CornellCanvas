 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 We recently noticed that some of the .ipynb file submitted on Gradescope could not generate a preview. This has created some trouble for grading since our graders need to download the file and open it manually.  Therefore, we will
 <b>
  only accept PDF file for future homework submissions
 </b>
 (including homework 8). If you have already submitted homework 8, please resubmitted it on Gradescope.
</p>
<p>
 You can easily convert your .ipynb file to pdf by 'print' function from your browser. Make sure to check the PDF file you export has everything readable (it is possible that there are some formatting issues). Feel free to come to our TA's office hours if you encounter any problems with this.
</p>
<p>
 Let us know if you have any questions
</p>
