 I have filled in the form to get a 1 year free license for Tableau. I got an email with a product key. It prompted me to install Tableau Desktop and Tableau Prep. I have also created an account and signed into it using my Cornell email. But the website keeps taking me to the same pages telling me to either fill in the same form to get the 1 year free license for students, buy Tableau, or get the 14-day free trial version. I can't seem to find the webpage where I can install it using the product key.

  I think you have to download the free trial, then during the installation you can enter the product key you received.
