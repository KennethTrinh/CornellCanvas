  I'm not sure why it makes sense to express the interval in terms of Y (and not the mean) when Y is the distribution? I have the mean and standard deviation and am not sure where to go from there.

  We only have one observed instance of Y. Following the hint, we will consider a symmetric interval (with Y in the middle). Y has been taken as a datapoint sampled from the random distribution that is uniform about [θ-1,θ+1]. The density (pdf) of a random uniform variable is 1/(b-a)  in the interval [a,b] and 0 outside. You are trying to compute a 95% confidence interval for θ, and you know that Y was taken from the uniform distribution about theta [θ-1, θ+1]. The interval will be in terms of Y, since that is all you know

  One way to do the question is to consider intervals that are symmetric around Y. if Y is in the center of the interval, and taken from the distribution surrounding theta, how wide does our confidence interval need to be so that we can be 95% sure that the interval contains θ
