  You may want to check Lecture 14 for questions regarding residual plots.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For model linearity question, we want to see on the residual plot that the LOWESS line is flat and the data is centered around the LOWESS line.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For constant variance question, we want to see on the absolute residual plot that the vertical spread of the points doesnâ€™t vary too much across the x axis.
