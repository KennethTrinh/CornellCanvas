<p>
 HW #10
</p>
<p>
 the questions asks you to use "The approximation Q/2 versus Q over the range of 1 to 30"
</p>
<p>
 What does this range refer to?
</p>
<p>
 Is it time T? our choice of Q?
</p>
<p>
 Do we assume Q = 1 or T = 1?
</p>

  Range refers to varying Q from 1 to 30.

   This was also confusing to me, the question mentions "You should see that the approximation is quite accurate for large t, like 100, and is less accurate for small t" but it also says fix t to be 100, so I don't see how we'd even see that trend without varying t.

    Yea, I think you need two lines, one modeling the approximation and one modeling q/2 vs q

     So this question does not need to change the value of t.
    </p>
    <p>
     But you could adjust the t value to something smaller and plot another graph.
