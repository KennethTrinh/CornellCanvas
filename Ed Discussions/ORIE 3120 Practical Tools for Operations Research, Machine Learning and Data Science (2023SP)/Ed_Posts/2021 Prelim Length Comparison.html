 On the practice prelim module, the 2021 prelim states "the length of this prelim is not representative of this year's prelim." However, both our prelim and the 2021 version are 90 minutes long. Does that mean our prelim is longer despite having the same time?

  Your prelim will be completable in 90 minutes. In 2021, the prelim was just on SQL.

  The length of the prelim could be different than the prelim in 2021 due to different material being covered and questions taking less or more time to complete.
