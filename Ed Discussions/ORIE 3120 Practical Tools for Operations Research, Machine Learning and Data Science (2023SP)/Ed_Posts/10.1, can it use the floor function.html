  For the expression of the average inventory over t, can we rewrite t in terms of m (integer), how many cycles of T_cycles t contains, and k (fraction &lt;1), the portion of the partial T_cycle contained in t, where t=T_cycle*m+k and make our answer in terms of m and k? I was able to do this for the code by using the floor function to calculate m, but wasn't sure this was allowed for the written out function
