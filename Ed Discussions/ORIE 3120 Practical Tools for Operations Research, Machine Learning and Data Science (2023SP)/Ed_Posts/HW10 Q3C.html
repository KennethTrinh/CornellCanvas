  I am having a lot of trouble finding out how to implement the probability of D&lt;=N in SQL. I understand how to count the number of values of where demand is greater than n for each n, but I cannot go past that. Am I misinterpreting something? Does the probability of d&lt;=n change as the d and n values change?

  Probability of x = number of occurrences where x is true / total number of occurrences
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The total number should stay the same. It is a simple count and then division from here.

  if we already find the total number of occurrences, can we hardcode it in our query for 3c?
