 Want to spread your love of STEM? Enjoy spending time with kids? Volunteer with WICC Outreach! Every week, WICC runs a Girls Who Code club for local middle and high schoolers to learn Computer Science. We rely on volunteers to engage our students. Apply to be a GWC Volunteer, or if youâ€™re looking for less of a time commitment, sign up to help facilitate other outreach events held throughout the semester. This semester, our Girls Who Code classes and external events will be held IN PERSON, so we are looking for volunteers! Apply using the link in our bio! Questions?
