 Problem #3

 HW #5

 Hi,
 <break>
 </break>
 I'm noticing very small discrepancies between the plot posted in the HW and the plot that comes out from my implementation. Should I be concerned about this discrepancy? Does it indicate an error in my solution?

  Restarting kernel and rerunning cells fixed the issue for me. Probably accidentally modified
  <code>
   df['duration']
  </code>
  .

    You should make sure that you are using
    <code>
     df['trip_distance']
    </code>
    instead of
    <code>
     df['rounded_trip_distance']
    </code>
    . You should also make sure you are not accidentally modifying
    <code>
     df['trip_distance']
    </code>
    or
    <code>
     df['duration']
    </code>
    anywhere in your code.

     Turns out I had filtered incorrectly because I thought day 0 was Sunday like in a normal calendar.

   It looks like your points are consistently a bit different from the correct answer.
  </p>
  <p>
   You are very close, but if you had the exact thing as correct, your points would be the same. For example in the solution at hour 0 we have a velocity of a little over 16mph and yours is a little over 14mph.
