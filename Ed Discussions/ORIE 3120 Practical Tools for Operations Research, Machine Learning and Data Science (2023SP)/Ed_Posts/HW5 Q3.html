  Hi,
  <break>
  </break>
  I'm noticing very small discrepancies between the plot posted in the HW and the plot that comes out from my implementation. Should I be concerned about this discrepancy? Does it indicate an error in my solution?

  It looks like your points are consistently a bit different from the correct answer.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  You are very close, but if you had the exact thing as correct, your points would be the same. For example in the solution at hour 0 we have a velocity of a little over 16mph and yours is a little over 14mph.

  Restarting kernel and rerunning cells fixed the issue for me. Probably accidentally modified
  <code>
   df['duration']
  </code>
  .

  You should make sure that you are using
  <code>
   df['trip_distance']
  </code>
  instead of
  <code>
   df['rounded_trip_distance']
  </code>
  . You should also make sure you are not accidentally modifying
  <code>
   df['trip_distance']
  </code>
  or
  <code>
   df['duration']
  </code>
  anywhere in your code.

  Turns out I had filtered incorrectly because I thought day 0 was Sunday like in a normal calendar.
