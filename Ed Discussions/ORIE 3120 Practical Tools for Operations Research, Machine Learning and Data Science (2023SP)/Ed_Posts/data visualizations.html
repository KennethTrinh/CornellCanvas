  scatterplots, bar graphs, histograms, line plots, heat maps, anything that you can think of to visualize data! We have learned about a bunch of data visualization techniques in this class, using both Python and Tableau. Get creative and present the visuals that you think would best explain your data to a reader.

  Do we need to include the python code for the graphs in our report for milestone 1?

  Also, would it be okay if some of our visualizations are created using tools other than python and tableau, such as R?
