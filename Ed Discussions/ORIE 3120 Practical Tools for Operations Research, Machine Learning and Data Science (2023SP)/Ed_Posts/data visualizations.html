  scatterplots, bar graphs, histograms, line plots, heat maps, anything that you can think of to visualize data! We have learned about a bunch of data visualization techniques in this class, using both Python and Tableau. Get creative and present the visuals that you think would best explain your data to a reader.

   Do we need to include the python code for the graphs in our report for milestone 1?
  </p>
  <p>
   Also, would it be okay if some of our visualizations are created using tools other than python and tableau, such as R?
