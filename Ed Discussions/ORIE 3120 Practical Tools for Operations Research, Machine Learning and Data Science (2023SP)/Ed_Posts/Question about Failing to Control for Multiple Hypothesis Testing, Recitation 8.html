 Problem #3
</p>
<p>
 HW #9
</p>
<p>
 If the below statement about p-values is the case, then why did we use this kind of method on Recitation 8 to determine which variables were significant (RiserDiam, SpruDiamBot, SprueDiamTop)? Didn't we fail to consider the increased likelihood of Type I errors due to multiple hypothesis testing?
</p>
<p>
 This question is from this part of the homework, but is more generally about methods we've used in this class:
</p>
<p>
 "In practice, unless the covariates were chosen extremely carefully, most covariates would have no predictive power for the health outcome.
 <underline>
  In this context, basing a judgment of statistical significance on standard p-values (the kind we have learned about in class and that are reported by statsmodels) can lead a person to incorrectly believe that many covariates do have predictive power.
 </underline>
 "

 Thanks!
