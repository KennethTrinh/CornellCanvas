 <paragraph>
  If the below statement about p-values is the case, then why did we use this kind of method on Recitation 8 to determine which variables were significant (RiserDiam, SpruDiamBot, SprueDiamTop)? Didn't we fail to consider the increased likelihood of Type I errors due to multiple hypothesis testing?

 <paragraph>
  This question is from this part of the homework, but is more generally about methods we've used in this class:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  "In practice, unless the covariates were chosen extremely carefully, most covariates would have no predictive power for the health outcome.
  <underline>
   In this context, basing a judgment of statistical significance on standard p-values (the kind we have learned about in class and that are reported by statsmodels) can lead a person to incorrectly believe that many covariates do have predictive power.
