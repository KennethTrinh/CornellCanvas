  For my last query,  I'm dividing 2 numbers and converting it to a percentage. I am currently casting them and then doing division and then using the ROUND function to round to 0 decimals. However, this is slightly off of the correct result for some records. However, when I use the FLOOR function to round, I have the same values as the example record. Should I be using the floor function or the round function?
