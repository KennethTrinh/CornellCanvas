 HW #1

 Hi! I really just cant figure out what rule is being applied to produce Col3 and why Albania wouldn't appear at all. Im not sure how much help can be offered over Ed but any clues would be appreciated. All the other ones seem clear but this one is beyond me.

  If you look at the countries starting with 'A', you can see that they have the 'A' trimmed off from the beginning. For 'Albania', as you notice, the entire word is trimmed off. For 'Angola', the 'An' is trimmed off.
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking at the documentation for SQL trim functions, the function removes leading characters from a string, specified by the second argument. For example, if I called LTRIM('United States','United'), I would be left with ' States', as I would continue trimming off characters from 'United States' as long as they appear in the second string, 'United'.
 </p>
 <p>
  So what could you specify in the trim function that could replicate the above result?
