   Question Asks: Calculate the covariance between εi and εj in terms of σ2 for two individuals i and j in the same city.
  </bold>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Users i and j in the same city share a common source of randomness (Zc), but I would think individual randomness is still independent.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Using Cov[A + B,C] = Cov[A,C] + Cov[B,C],
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Cov[εi, εj] = Cov[Zc(i) + Wi, Zc(j) + Wj] = Cov[Zi, Zj] + Cov[Zi, wj] + Cov[Wi, Zj] + Cov[Wi, Wj]
 </paragraph>
 <list style="unordered">
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    Cov[Zi, Zj] = 1 because the city randomness is correlated with itself.
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    City randomness (Z) with user randomness (W) is not correlated, so Cov[Zi, wj] + Cov[Wi, Zj] = 0
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    <bold>
     **What would Cov[Wi, Wj] = ? Other individuals may face the same randomness in same city more likely?
    </bold>
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
 </list>
 <paragraph>
  Because if Cov[Wi, Wj] =0 then Cov[εi, εj] = 1 which does not seem right. I got Cov[εi, εj] =0 for the part above.
