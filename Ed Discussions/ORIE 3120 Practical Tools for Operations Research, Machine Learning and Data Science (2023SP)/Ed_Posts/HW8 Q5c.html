 Problem #5c

 HW #8
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Question Asks: Calculate the covariance between εi and εj in terms of σ2 for two individuals i and j in the same city.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 Users i and j in the same city share a common source of randomness (Zc), but I would think individual randomness is still independent.
</p>
<p>
 Using Cov[A + B,C] = Cov[A,C] + Cov[B,C],
</p>
<p>
 Cov[εi, εj] = Cov[Zc(i) + Wi, Zc(j) + Wj] = Cov[Zi, Zj] + Cov[Zi, wj] + Cov[Wi, Zj] + Cov[Wi, Wj]
</p>
<list style="unordered">
 <li>
  <p>
   Cov[Zi, Zj] = 1 because the city randomness is correlated with itself.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   City randomness (Z) with user randomness (W) is not correlated, so Cov[Zi, wj] + Cov[Wi, Zj] = 0
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   <b>
    **What would Cov[Wi, Wj] = ? Other individuals may face the same randomness in same city more likely?
   </b>
  </p>
 </li>
</list>
<p>
 Because if Cov[Wi, Wj] =0 then Cov[εi, εj] = 1 which does not seem right. I got Cov[εi, εj] =0 for the part above.
