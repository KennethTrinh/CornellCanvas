  For two digits of precision, does it mean that 0 needs to be displayed as 0.00, and 0.4 needs to be displayed as 0.40, or are these not necessary?

  The 2 digits of precision specified refers to a round that SQL will calculate. You need to tell SQL to round to 2 digits of precision. We are more interested in your query.

  If SQL interprets 0 as 0, rather than 0.00, that is okay. However, if your number is 0.555555 (for example), we expect the output to be 0.56.
