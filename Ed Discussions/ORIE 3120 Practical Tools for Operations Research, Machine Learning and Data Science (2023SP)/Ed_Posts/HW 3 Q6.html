  Problem # 6: Confidence Intervals
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  HW # 3
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I'm thinking of trying to use the t-distribution to construct the confidence interval (I attached a screenshot below). I'm confused with this question because the hints say that we only observe 1 Y, which I interpret as n = 1. But if n = 1, then the degrees of freedom with be n - 1 = 0 which is not possible. I can't get the critical value is that's the case.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Also, when the hints say that the upper and lower bounds are supposed to be functions of Y, does this mean that the sample mean and sample variance used in the formula are supposed to be in terms of Y? If we go by the uniform distribution formulas, then the terms will contain theta.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Am I approaching this question the right way?

  Using the t-distribution is not necessary. Instead, think about how you can define a symmetric confidence interval in terms of Y (hint: you can add/subtract an algebraic variable to form the lower and upper bounds of your interval). Also, because you know that theta has a 95% chance of falling into this interval, you can use the probability density of Y to solve for the variable.
