  Hi everyone,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  When I left Rhodes 421 around 7:30 pm, there were shoes in a bag left in the room (happy to provide a description if you think they're yours - please email me at hm396@cornell.edu as I'll be more responsive there), which I took thinking they were another TA's. They are in my office in Rhodes 257, come by take them whenever you can if they are yours - ideally email me beforehand. If I don't hear anything in the next 24 hours, I'll put them back in Rhodes 421.
