  HW # 8
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Is there a reason we can't submit our homework as an ipynb file this week? oftentimes converting to a PDF changes formatting and can make it difficult to ensure all of the answers appear the way I want them to. More pressingly, I cannot convert my file to a pdf, it stalls my computer out. Is there a solution to this?
