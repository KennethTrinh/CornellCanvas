 Problem # 1
</p>
<p>
 HW # 2
</p>
<p>
 For the portion highlighted, should it say UnitPrice * quantity * Discount? The sentence says to multiply the discounts for a single record by the price without the discount, so why is this unitprice * quantity and not unitprice * discount * quantity (the discount for the full purchase of all items)?

  It says to multiply the discount field with the price without the discount.
 </p>
 <p>
  The price without the discount is UnitPrice * Quantity.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, the resulting answer for money spent on Discounts would be Unit Price * Quantity * Discount.
