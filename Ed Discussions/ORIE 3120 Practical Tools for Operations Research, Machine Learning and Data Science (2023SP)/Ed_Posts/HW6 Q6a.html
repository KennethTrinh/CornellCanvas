 Problem #6a
</p>
<p>
 HW #6
</p>
<p>
 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 I'm currently working on Q6a for HW6 and I was wondering if we were allowed to import preprocessing from sklearn when we are normalizing the SAT scores. If not, how would you recommend going about doing so? I also found that for part i, ii, and iii that the values were all the same in the summary and I wanted to confirm if this was correct?
</p>
<p>
 Thank you so much!
</p>

 <p>
  Values (estimated intercept, estimated slope, and sum of squared residuals) should change for i, ii, and iii.
 </p>
 <p>
  For the normalized SAT for iii, I am not sure what you are trying to import but if it normalizes correctly it should be fine. I would recommend doing it manually to be sure. Recall the normalized version of Xi, so Xâ€™i = (Xi-m) / s. Here, m=mean and s=standard deviation.
