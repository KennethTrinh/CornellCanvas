  HW #6

 <paragraph>
  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I'm currently working on Q6a for HW6 and I was wondering if we were allowed to import preprocessing from sklearn when we are normalizing the SAT scores. If not, how would you recommend going about doing so? I also found that for part i, ii, and iii that the values were all the same in the summary and I wanted to confirm if this was correct?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thank you so much!

  Values (estimated intercept, estimated slope, and sum of squared residuals) should change for i, ii, and iii.

  For the normalized SAT for iii, I am not sure what you are trying to import but if it normalizes correctly it should be fine. I would recommend doing it manually to be sure. Recall the normalized version of Xi, so Xâ€™i = (Xi-m) / s. Here, m=mean and s=standard deviation.
