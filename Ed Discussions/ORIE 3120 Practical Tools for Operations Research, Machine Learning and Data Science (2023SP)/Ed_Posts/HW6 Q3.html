 Problem # 3
</p>
<p>
 HW # 6
</p>
<p>
 When the problem states:
</p>
<p>
 These features must be one of the two following fields or things computed from them:
</p>
<list style="unordered">
 <li>
  <p>
   trip_distance
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   hour_of_day
  </p>
 </li>
</list>
<p>
 Does this mean we cannot use both fields as our features and we must only pick one?
</p>

  Yes, you can use either one of the fields or both fields as features as long as you maintain that there are less than 10 features being used all together.

   Is it ok if these are the only fields that we use? I made a multiple regression model with only these two as predictors and the R^2 is higher than 0.7.

    I think I might not be understanding the point of the problem if this is the case since fitting a linear regression using both features gives a R^2 value of 0.847 with no transformation needed

     I think maybe they want u to add a constant. Then R^2 is &lt; .7 and u need to add a couple features.
