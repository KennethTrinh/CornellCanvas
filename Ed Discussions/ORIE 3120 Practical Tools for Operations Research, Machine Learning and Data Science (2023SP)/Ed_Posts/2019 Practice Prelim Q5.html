 Question 5 on this practice prelim uses Replace in the solution and I was wondering if we will have to implement it during the exam. I know that this is an old prelim and some things may not be covered this semester, but we were not told to disregard this question. Any guidance would be greatly appreciated!

  it says in the lecture that "we wont use this command during homework or exams", so you will not be expected to know it.
