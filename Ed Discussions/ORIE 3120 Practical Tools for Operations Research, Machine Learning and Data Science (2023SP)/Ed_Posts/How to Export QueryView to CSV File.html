  Problem 4 in HW 1 requires us to export a query that we've created to a csv file, so we can use the file to plot graphs in Python or Google Colab. But I can't seem to find a way to do that. The homework states that we should learn how to do it from recitation.

  I checked the recitation file and I don't see where it shows how to do that. I tried to search for it online, but many websites and videos show how to export to csv files using different programs.

  I followed these instructions from the top of page 6 of the recitation (but instead of exporting a table, you need to export the results of the query you write in Q4). The export button is the blue icon with arrows pointing outward near the top right. Hope that helps!
