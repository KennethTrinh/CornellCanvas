 Problem #5a

 HW #6
</p>
<p>
 I'm a bit confused how we're supposed to plot a set of values if we only have 1 data point for the hat values. Are we supposed to compare it to (0,0) and calculate the slope from there? Any help is greatly appreciated. Thank you!

  Look at #351
 </p>
 <p>
  You have 2 datapoints. Train a regression on this model. then get the yhat values by using the model to predict the y values from x

   Since you're doing a prediction on the 2
   <code>
    x
   </code>
   inputs, wouldn't you get a single yhat1 and a single yhat2? So it's a set consisting of just one element?
