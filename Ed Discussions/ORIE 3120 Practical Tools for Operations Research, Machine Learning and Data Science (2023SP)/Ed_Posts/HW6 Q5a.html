  I'm a bit confused how we're supposed to plot a set of values if we only have 1 data point for the hat values. Are we supposed to compare it to (0,0) and calculate the slope from there? Any help is greatly appreciated. Thank you!

  Since you're doing a prediction on the 2
  <code>
   x
  </code>
  inputs, wouldn't you get a single yhat1 and a single yhat2? So it's a set consisting of just one element?
