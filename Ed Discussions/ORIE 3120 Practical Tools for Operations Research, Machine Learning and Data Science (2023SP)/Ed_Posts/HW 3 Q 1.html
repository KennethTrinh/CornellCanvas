  HW # 3
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I wanted to make a query that groups Revenue into OrderID, so I can join from another view that has orderID, customerID, and CompanyName on the two OrderIDs mathing.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Select OrderID, ROUND(SUM(UnitPrice*Quantity*(1-Discount)),2) as Revenue
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  From OrderDetail
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Group by OrderID
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Anyone know why this code isn't working? Numbers come out to be a lot smaller than perceived

  You can solve this question with just one query using 2 LEFT JOINs (because we need to match orders AND customers). It is much easier to just use one query, but if you want to use two, I think you should use a TOTAL() function rather than sum, because you are multiplying.

  If I do this in one query I'm pulling from three separate tables. Anytime I tried to do this I just got an error. So this is possible in one query with two left joins?
