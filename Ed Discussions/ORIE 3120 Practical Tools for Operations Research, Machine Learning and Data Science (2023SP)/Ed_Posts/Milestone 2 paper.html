  For the milestone 2 paper, are we adding our data analysis models along with the visualizations that we had in our milestone 1 paper? Or are we just adding these models (and their explanations?)

  The main focus for milestone 2 is the data analysis methods you use and how they answer the questions you raise. You do not need to include the visualization in milestone 1, but you could do that if you think any of the visualizations is important to give insight into your analysis
