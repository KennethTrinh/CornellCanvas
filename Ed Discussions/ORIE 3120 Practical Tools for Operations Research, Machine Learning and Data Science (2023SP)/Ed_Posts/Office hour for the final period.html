  There will be no regular office hours during the final period. But we are releasing more slots for the project office hour for the next few days. You can also sign up for Julia's office hour tomorrow 2:30pm - 3:30pm for the project meeting

  Are there any possible openings on Sunday for more project OH? I realize this is quite late but my group would love to get our project looked over (even briefly) before the final submission on Monday. Thank you so much!
