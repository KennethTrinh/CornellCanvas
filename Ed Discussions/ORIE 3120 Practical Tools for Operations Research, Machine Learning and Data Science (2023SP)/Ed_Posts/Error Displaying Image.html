  This isn't a direct fix to your problem, but I used Latex format for my formula ... little bit tedious

  Ideally, I'd like to avoid that. But might have to be the move for this one unfortunately. Docs is just such a more user friendly format for typing math

  If you already have it in docs, I think you can plug it into a Latex converter website to get the Latex version

  I ended up figuring it out -- by adding an r in front of the string it parsed it properly and I was able to get my image to display
