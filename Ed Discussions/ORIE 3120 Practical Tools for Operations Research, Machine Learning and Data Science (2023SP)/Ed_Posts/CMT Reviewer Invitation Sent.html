  It still looks the same unfortunately. Not sure if I'm the only person unable to see them, maybe it's an issue on my end...

  Could you check later today and see if it gets changed? Maybe it takes some time to update in the system. Please also let me know about the result. Thanks!

  Hi I am having the same problem. I was not sent the peer feedback form on CMT. The same issue that Lucia described below is happening to me. Can I please get some help?

  There are two things to check: 1. Did you accept the reviewer invite? 2. Did you change your role to 'Reviewer' in CMT? You can change this on top of the webpage.
