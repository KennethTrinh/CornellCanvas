  We trim 'Angola' from the left as long as we see characters that are present in the string 'Albania' (that is, as long as we see an a, l, b, n, or i).
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For 'Angola', the first character on the left is trimmed since it is an a. The next character n is also trimmed. We stop trimming at 'g' since 'g' is not an a, l, b, n, or i.
