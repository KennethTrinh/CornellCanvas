  HW #10
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The problem is: Calculate what the optimal order quantity would be if this were instead h I(t)^2. Assume, as we do in EOQ, that the time over which we calculate cost is a multiple of T.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Should our answer be in terms of K, lambda, c, and h since the equation for cost is in terms of those variables?

  When you optimize the annual cost to obtain EOQ, you will get rid of c as in the lecture.
