 Hello! I was reviewing the slides from Lecture 6, specifically the "Let's practice (Q4)" example. I inputted the numbers into Jupyter and was confused about the order of the results. In df_t1, since the first row has id=1 and a=20, why does that come in as row 4 rather than row 0 in the final result? I am confused about how the order of results is determined when using full outer join.
</p>
<p>
 Any help is appreciated. Thank you!

  Interesting. My guess is that it depends on how full outer join gets implemented in the version of SQL you use, which might use some algorithm (like divide and conquer) behind the scene that improves efficiency. If you want to output the table in a particular order, you might want to do it manually, like using ORDER BY.
