 HW #4
</p>
<p>
 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 What filters should we have to create the correct graph? Should the distance filter be a dimension, attribute or measure such as maximum? I have tried all of them but I can't get the correct graph.

  You can create a calculated measure that involves tableau functions, such as POWER, SQRT, and COS, with the attributes like the longitude and latitude.
