  Can someone explain the intuition behind these? Why is the one with the most influential and least influential feature the second. Does influential mean largest parameter?

  Influentiality is based on the value of the actual coefficients used to generate the data. You can imagine a feature with a coefficient of 100 is likely to explain more of the variation in the outcome variable as opposed to a covariate with a coefficient of 0.01, for example. Additionally, including multiple covariates as opposed to just one will always explain more of the variation, which is indicated by the increase in R^2.
