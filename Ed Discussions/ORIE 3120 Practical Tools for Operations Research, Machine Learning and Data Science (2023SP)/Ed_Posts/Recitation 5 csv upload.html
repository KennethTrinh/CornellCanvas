 Recitation # 5
</p>
<p>
 When I try to upload the csv into google collab, the tab on the right says unauthorized so I can't view the data. I tried redownloading and reuploading but it's still the same. This has never happened before in previous assignments. How can I fix this? Thanks.

  You can try to use Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook on your own computer under the same working directory with your dataset or specifying the directory of the dataset. If this approach doesn't work, you can come to tomorrow's recitation.

   I had the same problem before. Instead of downloading using the download button on the recitation 5 canvas page, click on "diabetic_data_orie3120_rec5.csv" and then click the blue download button
