  Hi, I'm having trouble finding where we are supposed to submit the Data Visualization due on Wednesday and whether we are supposed to coordinate peer feedback or whether we are assigned another group to give feedback to. Also, is the Data Visualization the same thing as the Project Milestone 1?

  From the syllabus:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  "There will be two major project milestones: Data visualization,
  <bold>
   due on Wed April 12
  </bold>
  ; and Data analysis + stochastic modeling,
  <bold>
   due on Mon May 15
  </bold>
  . Students will also be required to submit a brief initial project plan via a google form on
  <bold>
   Wed
  </bold>
  <bold>
   Mar 15
  </bold>
  . Students will also be required to provide peer feedback on both the project milestone and final report on
  <bold>
   Wed Apr 19
  </bold>
  and
  <bold>
   Wed May 17
  </bold>
  ."

  Both the report and peer feedback should be submitted through CMT (if it is the same as the previous year), and I will remind Prof. Frazier to get it settled.

  Yes, the data visualization is the same thing as Project Milestone 1.
