 Recitation # 1
</p>
<p>
 I've been going through the recitation and I can't seem to solve this problem. I created the view for the first Invoice, but when I create the view for the second invoice, I keep getting error after copying the SQL code word for word...
</p>
<p>
 [21:17:20] Could not load data for view Q020Revenue. Error details: Error while executing SQL query on database 'Chinook_Sqlite': near ")": syntax error
</p>
<p>
 I don't know whats wrong since I am just following the recitation instructions
</p>

    Many of the errors on this question came from typos - in particular, check your capitalization. If you are still unable to find the issue, we can help you in office hours or recitation.
