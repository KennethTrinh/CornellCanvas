  On 6b of homework 9, we do not know the distribution of the demand, correct? Is it enough to plot Q vs total cost and look and see the lowest point to find Q* using empirical risk minimization, or do we need to plot Q vs P(D&lt;=Q)? Attached below is the lecture slide I am basing my question off of.

 <paragraph>
  If we need to plot Q vs P(D&lt;=Q), is there a coding method/function that we should use to calculate P(D&lt;=Q)? I am currently unsure of how to do this because D's distribution is unknown and D is not continuous, and I'm assuming that we are not supposed to use the bisection method because the problem asks for us to use empirical risk minimization.

  You can find the optimal number of bagels by computing Q* -- the minimum value on your plot.
