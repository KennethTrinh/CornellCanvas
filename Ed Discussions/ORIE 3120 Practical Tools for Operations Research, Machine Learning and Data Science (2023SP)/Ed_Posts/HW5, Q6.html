  Problem #6a
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  HW #5
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For this problem, are we assuming that x is a discrete random variable (and can only take values that increment by 0.1 from -5 to 5)?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thank you!
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Also, the instructions say that "
  <bold>
   We have a medical test producing a test value that is normally distributed with unknown variance μ and known variance 1."
  </bold>
  Does it by any chance mean unknown
  <underline>
   mean
  </underline>
  μ
  <bold>
   ?
  </bold>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thanks again!

  Hi Jenna,

   <paragraph>
    x is a continuous random variable, that is, it can take any real value (including less than -5 or more than 5, but that is extremely unlikely).
   </paragraph>

   <paragraph>
    I am nearly certain that is the case, thanks for spotting that! I'll change it now, and will change it back in the very unlikely scenario that it was meant to be variance.
