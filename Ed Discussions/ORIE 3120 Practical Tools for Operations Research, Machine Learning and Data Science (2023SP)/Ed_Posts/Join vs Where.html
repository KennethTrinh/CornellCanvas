 On some of the practice prelims, it mentions that there is an equivalent WHERE and JOIN statement. Does WHERE do the same thing as one of the JOINS, or is it more complicated than that?

  WHERE is typically used to filter data.
 </p>
 <p>
  In some cases, WHERE can also be used to join data. For example you could have a query:
 </p>
 <p>
  SELECT *
 </p>
 <p>
  FROM x, y
 </p>
 <p>
  WHERE x.name = y.name
 </p>
 <p>
  Here, you use a WHERE clause to define the join. This is an implicit join where you can join on a particular feature.
