  Problem 2

  HW 3
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Problem 2 asked as to write a query that returns all customers from the customers table that have not placed an order.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I assumed that the we we check if the customer is placed an order is to see if the orderID under customers appears in Orders table. However, i noticed that on the example, CustomerID = Anton actually do appear in the orders, meaning that this ID has been placed an order. I guess I understand this question incorrectly. Do you mind letting me know which part i understood incorrectly (Or do you mind clarifying what does it mean by customers who have not placed an order)? Thank you!

  Customers who have not placed an order will essentially never have a record matched to their CustomerID in the Orders table. This should give you a hint as to how you should join, if you want to ensure that customers who have not places an order appear with a revenue of 0.

  Follow up on Varun's comment, double-check what you see is "ANTO" or "ANTON".

  I run this query, and it does return NULL on my end:
  <code>
   SELECT * FROM orders WHERE orders.CustomerID = "ANTON"
  </code>
