 Q1: Supposed (correct) value of the slope beta1 and the fitted value of the slope beta1 are two different things. We want to see the fraction of times that the supposed value lies in the confidence interval.
</p>
<p>
 Q1 &amp; Q2: Both sm.OLS approach and smf.ols approach should be fine. But they have different call-in parameters and output indexing (say the indexing in confidence intervals and p-values).
</p>
<p>
 Q2: B is the supposed value of the slope and p-value is associated with the fitted value of the slope. Think about why we set the range of B starting from 0.1 in part (a). Additionally, we are expecting a single value output (and your code) for part (b).
</p>
<p>
 Q3: Use HW5 Q1&amp;Q2 as a hint and think about what we filter there. Recitation 7 can also be a hint and think about how we adjust the model there.
</p>
<p>
 Q4: Try to justify you answers based on both the plots (check #329) and the codes. But the autocorrelation and normal Q-Q plots are optional at this moment.
