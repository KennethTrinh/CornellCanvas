 Are we allowed to use ARIMA/SARIMA and Holt-Winters models for the forecasting component of our project? I know these were not discussed in class but would be useful for our dataset.
</p>
<p>
 Additionally, are we allowed to use a complementary dataset in order to analyze time series data without joining it to the original dataset?
</p>
<p>
 Thank you!

  Yes, you can use the models you mentioned. And yes you can use other datasets without joining if they help you with the analysis.
