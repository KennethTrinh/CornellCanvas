 Canvas says "You may bring up to one sheet of paper (i.e., two pages, front and back), to the exam with any notes that you wish to take.
 <b>
  This can be handwritten or printed
 </b>
 ."

 By printed, does that mean we are allowed to type out notes and then print, or does that mean it still needs to be handwritten digitally and then printed?
