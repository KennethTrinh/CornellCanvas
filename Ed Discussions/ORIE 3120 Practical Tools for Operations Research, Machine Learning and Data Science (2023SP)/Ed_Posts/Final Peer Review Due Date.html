 On ed discussion it says the peer review for the final report is may 18th 11:59, but on cmt it says may 22... any way we could clarify what the due date truly is?

    Oh sorry about the confusion, that is actually the timeline from last year. We put it there as a placeholder for applying for the CMT page since we do not have an independent webpage for the course this year.

     And I am willing to provide some extension if you missed the peer review because of this.
