 My team is using a test/train to answer one question and a linear regression to answer a separate question. Does this count as two separate tools?

  As mentioned in the project doc, "selecting a statistical model for a prediction task based on train/test splits" would count as a different method from linear regression. This

   involves

  doing a train/test split, but it is more than simply doing one.
