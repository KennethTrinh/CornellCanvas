  What does it mean to compute a PDF "at" 1 or "at" 2. Shouldn't it be a range? When trying to do 6(d), would doing pdf(1.5) get greater than 1.5 or less?

  I might just be misunderstanding what's happening with the function.

  For 6d, you may want CDF instead of PDF. PDF is normally associated with a single data point while CDF is associated with a range.
