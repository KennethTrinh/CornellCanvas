  For the bagels graphing question for 6a, how do we go about doing so? I'm a little lost on what exactly we're trying to graph as well as how we might achieve this without using a for loop. I've included what I have done so far below:

  Try writing a function to compute average daily cost for inputs of Q. You should average over the demand values. You can use a for loop if needed

  For some reason, my graph is slightly off from the answer of 48 and is giving me 44 as the answer. I set demand equal to the average demand from the column in the dataframe. My graph looks more v shaped rather than a smooth curve as well. Thank so much!

  Don't set demand equal to the average demand.
