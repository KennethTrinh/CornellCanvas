  In part b, it states that the view produced will only have one record for each OrderID. However, in part d, it states that an OrderID can show up in more than one record in Q3b. This seems like conflicting information to me, could someone please clarify?

  You might want to think about whether your dataset has NULL values or not. For example, if your dataset has three records with NULL values, SQL would count those as three seperate records, instead of consolidating those three records into one NULL record. So if your dataset does have NULL values, you would need to consider using the DISTINCT keyword, as the HW states.
