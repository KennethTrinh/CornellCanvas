 Problem #1a &amp; 1b
</p>
<p>
 HW #10
</p>
<p>
 I am confused about what the expression we should end up with is. I tried to calculate the equation, but keep ending up with an expression with (t mod T) and so when I plot the approximation and exact plots, I get two plots. The plots are very close in small amounts of Q but then separate from each other. I don't know if my expression for part a is valid or not. I could use some help with determining the equation properly.

  The final expression could be dependent on t mod T. You might also need to think of floor(t/T), which will be useful in the final expression
