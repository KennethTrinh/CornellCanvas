 If we want to test Linear Assumptions with multiple variables, do we create residual plots for each of the variables?

  Also are we including Q-Q plots for testing normal errors? It is on the slides but we were not evaluated on homework I believe?

  You should only have one residual plot for one set of dependent variables. You could include a Q-Q plot, and you can use methods that are not discussed in the lecture for final project
