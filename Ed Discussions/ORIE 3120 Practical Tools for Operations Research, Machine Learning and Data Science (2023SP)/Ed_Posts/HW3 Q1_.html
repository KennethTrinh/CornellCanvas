 I may be doing this incorrectly, but if revenue is the sum of all purchases, shouldn't it be higher than the example above. When executing the query without the GROUP BY or JOIN, the sum of the individual rows for ALFKI seem to be a lot larger than 4273.

 I hope that made sense!

  Hey y'all--I was stumped on this for a while; remember to make sure that the orderid matches between tables. That's where I think the issue on my end came from

    Could you explain how you arrived at larger values than the ones provided in the example? Also, could you provide your reasoning for why you believe the values should be larger? This would be helpful in identifying the discrepancies. Thanks!

    My suggestion would be double checking whether you are selecting from ORDERS table or selecting from CUSTOMERS table.
