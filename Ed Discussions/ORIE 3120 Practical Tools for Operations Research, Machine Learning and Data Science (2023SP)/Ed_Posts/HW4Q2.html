  I already did the map but I am unsure if we need to calculate the total number of orders with type EO and ER or just the total number by city? If we need to do the total overall, I am unsure how to do this rather than using "view data" and adding by hand the "distinct count of OrderID" table.

  You may want to refer back to the recitation, in which we used Tableau to calculate the number of rows in the dataset. Think about how you could use the "Text" marks and what fields you would want to display, as well as how to separate them into EO and RR and count them.

  Is this to just help us with creating the map or do we need to show this additionally in the homework?
