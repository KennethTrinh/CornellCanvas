  I have a question about the 2021 Prelim question 1G. I don't see how the solution include the special case where Day reaches its maximum. From the example, it seams that the Gap of days when Day reaches its maximum should be min(Day). I am not sure if I understand the question or the solution correctly.

 <paragraph>
  Usually Gap should be counted as Day(i+1) - Day(i). However, when i = max, how to calculate Gap?

  Do you mind briefly explain it? Thank you!

  The question says " A record should be returned for all days on which the student was tested except for the last one" so there is no need to calculate the gap for when i=max
