  My group is looking into linear regression to predict housing prices as 1 data analysis method. We also wanted to create multiple linear regression models and use training/testing split and model summary analysis to determine which predictors/model is best for accurately predicting housing prices. Does choosing between multiple linear regression model count as a separate analysis technique from just using linear regression.

  I think you should consider the difference between the findings and insights that can be introduced using the methods. For now, I cannot see how these two would yield a really different result since they are both based on some linear regression, so I would say that cannot be counted as a separate data analysis method.

  I see. Then it could be considered as a different method. And actually, on project google doc it mentions that "

   selecting a statistical model for a prediction task based on train/test splits"
  </bold>
  will be a separate method.
