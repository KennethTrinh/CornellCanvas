  It is not necessary to use the Python logistic regression function to solve this problem.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Instead, you can think about first defining an input variable for your logistic regression. (It should be some linear combination of your x1, x2, and betahat values.) Then, using this variable, you can form a boolean equation similarly to boolean equation you've been asked to find (where the predicted logistic value is above 1/2.)
