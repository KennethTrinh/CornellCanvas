  This question seems unclear as to if CustID is needed as a field for these views. If we are to see that dealership 56805 has 100% EO we would need CustID, but it doesn't say in instructions to include this field.

  This is sort of implicitly defined, as we would need the CustID field to perform the left join with the previous two views you created. And generally, if you are displaying fields like number of orders, total sales values, etc. it would be useful to know which customer those numbers correspond to. Hope that helps!
