  Shouldn't an INNER JOIN be used in this case? The question asks for records of songs whose streaming numbers change so I believe that records who do not appear in both tables should not be included in the query.

  Good question. I don't think you will lose any points for using Inner join. Left join here captures the songs that streamed on Feb 19, but not streamed on Feb 20, which are likely to have differences greater than 10000. But I also think that Inner join returns a more refined answer.
