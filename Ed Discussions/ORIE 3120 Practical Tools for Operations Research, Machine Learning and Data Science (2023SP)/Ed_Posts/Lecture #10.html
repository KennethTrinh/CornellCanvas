 Why are the location IDs offset? Shouldn't they be the same if they are the join clause?

  The first “column” just indexes the rows and can be used to refer to a specific row number in the DataFrame. It’s honestly kind of arbitrary: you could reorder the records in the DataFrame and get different values for these.

  The LocationID column gives us the identification for a specific zone which is more important to us, because we can join on this as you said.
