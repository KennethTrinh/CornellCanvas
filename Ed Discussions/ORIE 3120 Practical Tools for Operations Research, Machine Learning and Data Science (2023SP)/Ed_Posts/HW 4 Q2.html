 Problem # 2
</p>
<p>
 HW # 4
</p>
<p>
 The question says "
 <b>
  Use Tableau to calculate the number of orders with type EO. Also calculate the number of orders with type RR. Use a “COUNT DISTINCT” aggregation on the Order ID. This counts the number of distinct, i.e., different, OrderIDs."
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 Is this in addition to creating the map? How do we use Tableau to printfor SQL-like calculations?

  From the map, you can right click on data points, press "view data" and analyze the data from there. This will help determine the number of EO and RR orders.
