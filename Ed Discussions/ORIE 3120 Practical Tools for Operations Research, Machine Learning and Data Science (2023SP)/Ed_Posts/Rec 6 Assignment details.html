  Recitation #6
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I see on Gradescope that Recitation 6 is due on March 14 - are there assignment details posted to Canvas?  If not, when will it be posted?  Thanks!

  It has been posted on canvas. Generally, it will be posted before the first recitation, which is around Thursday for our current schedule.

  Is the submission supposed to be a python notebook? Because the current gradescope submission is set up only to allow pdfs and images. Could that be changed?

  I currently do not find a place on gradescope to change the setting. You can export the notebook to a pdf file.

  One way is to use 'print', which you can find under Files tab.
