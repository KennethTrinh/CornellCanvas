 For the project, if I were to dummy code a variable with a value of 1 or 0, each corresponding to a  category, and then run a linear regression, would this still count as linear regression? Or is this technically a logistic regression?

  It would make a lot more sense here to do a logistic regression. Linear regression is used on continuous data while logistic is used to predict binary values
