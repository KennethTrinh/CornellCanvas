 Hi!
</p>
<p>
 I was just wondering how the peer feedback factors into our participation grade for the class. The syllabus and the announcement mention that it counts for points, but I could not find any place that mentions how much they count for and whether they are graded just for completion or the quality of the feedback. Would love some insight into that if possible! Thank you.
