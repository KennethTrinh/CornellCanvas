 Problem #4 and 6
</p>
<p>
 HW #10
</p>
<p>
 For 4, is the cost of underage supposed to be 10 or 15?  The question is unclear and the TAs in office hours are giving different answers.
</p>
<p>
 For 6b, the problem states that "
 <b>
  set the number of eggs to cook via 3 * round(A + B * probability_of_rain)."
 </b>
 However, I asked multiple TAs, and they all said that the 3 should not be multiplied in the code, but showed uncertainty about this answer.  Should we multiply by 3 or not?
</p>
<p>
 Thank you!
</p>

  If you are letting q = the number of eggs to cook, you should indeed multiply by 3.
 </p>
 <p>
  For 4, we want to interpret the cost of underage to be "how much extra do I have to pay per unit of inventory I have missing (unfulfilled demand)". In this case, it should be 15.
 </p>
 <p>
  A good way to think about this is to figure out separate expressions for the cost in two cases: when Q &gt; D and when Q &lt; D, and relate that to the overage and underage expressions.

   Don't you have to pay 15 for each unit missing? Unlike last week where we sold bagels for profit, so we lost out on 1.08 - 0.54 for each bagel missing. However, in this problem we must fulfill all demand, so if you're short (Q &lt; D) you have to pay the full 15.

    Yes youâ€™re correct, it should be 15. This is because in the underage case, you only fulfill Q demand.

    Just to confirm: underage cost = 15 and overage cost = 5?
