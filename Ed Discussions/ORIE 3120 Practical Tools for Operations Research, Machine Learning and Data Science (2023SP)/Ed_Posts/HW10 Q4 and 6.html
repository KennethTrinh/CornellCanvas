  Problem #4 and 6
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  HW #10
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For 4, is the cost of underage supposed to be 10 or 15?  The question is unclear and the TAs in office hours are giving different answers.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For 6b, the problem states that "
  <bold>
   set the number of eggs to cook via 3 * round(A + B * probability_of_rain)."
  </bold>
  However, I asked multiple TAs, and they all said that the 3 should not be multiplied in the code, but showed uncertainty about this answer.  Should we multiply by 3 or not?

  If you are letting q = the number of eggs to cook, you should indeed multiply by 3.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For 4, we want to interpret the cost of underage to be "how much extra do I have to pay per unit of inventory I have missing (unfulfilled demand)". In this case, it should be 15.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  A good way to think about this is to figure out separate expressions for the cost in two cases: when Q &gt; D and when Q &lt; D, and relate that to the overage and underage expressions.

  Just to confirm: underage cost = 15 and overage cost = 5?

  Don't you have to pay 15 for each unit missing? Unlike last week where we sold bagels for profit, so we lost out on 1.08 - 0.54 for each bagel missing. However, in this problem we must fulfill all demand, so if you're short (Q &lt; D) you have to pay the full 15.

  Yes youâ€™re correct, it should be 15. This is because in the underage case, you only fulfill Q demand.
