 On the Milestone 2 description, it says we can use forecasting for one of our methods. The class calendar says this topic is in lecture 14 however this only goes over Confidence intervals, p values, hypothesis testing.
</p>
<p>
 Can we use forecasting and where do we find information on how to do it?

  Hey Jake,
 </p>
 <p>
  There's some lecture material on the former ORIE 3120 class website: https://people.orie.cornell.edu/pfrazier/orie3120/demos/lec15_forecasting.pdf
  <break>

  I'm not sure if this lecture is going to be included this semester, so perhaps an ORIE 3120 course staff member would know more.
