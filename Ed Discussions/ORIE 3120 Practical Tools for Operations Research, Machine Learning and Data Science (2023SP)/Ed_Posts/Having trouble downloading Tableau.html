  Hello,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  When I go to download the software on my laptop (MacBook), it never actually downloads and instead shows me the same screen, shown below, over and over. Is there anything I can do to fix this?

  I would suggest attending Office hours, as I cannot tell what is wrong from just this screenshot.
