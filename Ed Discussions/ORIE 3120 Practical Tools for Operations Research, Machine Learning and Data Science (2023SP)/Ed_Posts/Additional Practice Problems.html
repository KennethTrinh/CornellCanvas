  How come in question 4 of the additional problems posted for the exam, column trip_distance of dataframe taxi is referenced by taxi.trip_distance instead of taxi['trip_distance']? Are they interchangeable or is there a difference between these two kinds of references?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Also, in general in Pandas when would we use words AND and OR instead of &amp; and |?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For Pandas joins, if A.join(B, ON=...) does the ON= require the column of A or B that will be used for the join?
 </paragraph>

  Thanks!

  1. They seem interchangeable but we typically use taxi['trip_distance']
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  for setting, values, you need to use
  <code>
   df['column'] = series
  </code>
  .
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  once this is done however, you can refer to that column in the future with
  <code>
   df.column
  </code>
  , assuming it's a valid python name. (so
  <code>
   df.column
  </code>
  works, but
  <code>
   df.6column
  </code>
  would still have to be accessed with
  <code>
   df['6column']
  </code>
  )

  2. &amp; and | are used in pandas. AND and OR are used in python (will not work in pandas). If comparing things in pandas dataframes, use &amp; and |.

  3. the ON= needs to be the column that is the same name in both dataframes A and B.
