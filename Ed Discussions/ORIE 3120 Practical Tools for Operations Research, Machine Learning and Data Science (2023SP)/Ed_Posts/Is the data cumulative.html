 </paragraph>
 <list style="unordered">
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>

  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    n_poverty_190 is the number of people living in the country with income of less than $1.90 USD per day. This is measured in the millions of people, so a value of 0.5 in this field corresponds to 500,000 people.
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    n_poverty_320 similarly measures the number of people living with less than $3.20 USD per day, also measured in the millions of people.

  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    n_poverty_550 similarly measures the number of people living with less than $5.50 USD per day, also measured in the millions of people.
   </paragraph>
