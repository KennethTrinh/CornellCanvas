 I recently set up the CMT account and accepted the invitation, however I cannot change my role from Author to Review. CMT says that I might be logged in with the wrong email but I'm logged in with my school email so that's not the issue.

     I just resend the link, but I saw that you have already accepted the invitation on my end.
