  Hi all - there has been some confusion on Question 5 and the bounds of each histogram bin. I wanted to clarify that you should be using UnitPrice (NOT RoundedUnitPrice) to bin the values. In this case, the original bins of [-5,5), [5,15), etc. should still hold, and your query should be expected to match these bins. Thanks!
