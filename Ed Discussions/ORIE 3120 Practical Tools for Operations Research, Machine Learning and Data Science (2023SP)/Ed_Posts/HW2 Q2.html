 <paragraph>
  The instructions do not say to combine all orders with the same OrderID.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For instance, there are four OrderIDs with 11030.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  However if you look at example picture and you add up the the four OrderIDs with 11030 the results are the same.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Should we consolidate the query to group by OrderID

  Yes. It's important to note that each record doesn't correspond to an order, but rather the purchase of some amount of a certain product. This can be traced back to a certain order number, and we want the discount, undiscounted revenue, etc. across all products of a given order, which can be done using a GROUP BY.

  I attempted to do it without using the SUM functions in the SELECT statement because I knew that GROUPBY would sum the numbers of the same OrderID for me, but I couldn't get the result shown in the screenshot. However, when I added the SUM functions it gave me the correct screenshot. I still don't get why I need to add the SUM functions if GROUP BY does it? Why do they result in different things?
