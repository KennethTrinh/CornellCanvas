 Hi -
</p>
<p>
 Is it possible that we could please be updated on the timeline for project feedback from the TAs? This would be really useful in figuring out what changes and improvements to make for the final report.
</p>
<p>
 Thanks
</p>

  Sorry about the delay. It is almost done. I think the worst case is that we will let the review be available on CMT before the end of this week for the majority of the groups.
