  Hello Professor Frazier and Course Staff,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Is it possible to extend the deadline for HW #10? My peers and I realize that this particular problem set has been challenging more than the rest; we would really appreciate it if an extension was granted for this assignment, so that we can have more time to understand and conceptualize our approaches.

  If an extension is not possible, can the TA's be provided with the appropriate answer key at least because this has stopped the TAs from being able to help with some of the questions.
