  The peer review questions have been updated on CMT. Here is an instruction:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1. Change your role to 'reviewer'. With a high probability, you are assigned to the same group in which you did milestone 1. If you get assigned to a new group, you do not need to do a review for milestone 1 again.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. You can download the report from the download button, which will be a zip file of all the submissions. You can also click on the place where I circle in red, where you can download the submission individually if you want.  This can also let you to check whether the group you get assigned has submitted any milestone 2. (Notice that our due date for milestone 2 is today at 4:30pm so the submission might change if you do it now)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  3. Click on "Edit Review".  You will be directed to the peer review form. The questions for milestone 2 start at Question 13. You need to scroll down the form to see the questions.

  It doesn't let us submit if we got a group that we didn't have for milestone 1 as the fields up to question 13 are required. How should we submit?
