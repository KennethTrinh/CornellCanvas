  I noticed the qq plot for file D was heavy-tailed, so I was wondering why the solution says the errors are normal. I mightâ€™ve done the qq plot wrong though.

  The solution has the interpretation from just the code. We didn't ask you to make qq plots on this homework, so just looking at the code for generation you should find the distribution of the errors.

  Even looking at the code, we know x is ~Uniform(0, 1) and N is ~Normal(0, 1), so I'm not sure how we can conclude x * N has a normal distribution. If x was instead a constant, then it would make more sense to me.

  See this screenshot for the interpretation of D.

  Residuals are not normally distributed. You are correct. I am unsure of your question
