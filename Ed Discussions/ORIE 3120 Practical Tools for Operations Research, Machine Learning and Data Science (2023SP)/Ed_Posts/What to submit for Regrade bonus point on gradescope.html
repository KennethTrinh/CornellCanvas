 Problem # 7

 HW # 1
</p>
<p>
 Sorry if this has been addressed before but what do I submit here? I was under the impression from the syllabus that the regrade bonus points are an automatic system but it won't let me proceed without submitting something here.

  Check the answer in #29. It seems that you only need to submit a blank image as a placeholder.
