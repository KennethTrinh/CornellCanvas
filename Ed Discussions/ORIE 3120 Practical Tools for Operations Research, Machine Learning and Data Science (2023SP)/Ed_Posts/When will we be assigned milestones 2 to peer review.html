  Hi!
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  When after the Milestone 2 submission deadline will we be assigned Milestone 2s to peer review? Will it be the same topics as we were assigned to peer review before?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thank you!

  We are planning to modify the reviewer's form on CMT today. And you can do the review if the group has already submitted their milestone 2.

  With a high probability, you will be assigned to the same group that you review for milestone 1
