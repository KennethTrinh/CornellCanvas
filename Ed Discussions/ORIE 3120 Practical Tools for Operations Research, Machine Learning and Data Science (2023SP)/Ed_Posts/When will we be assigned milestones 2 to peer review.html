 Hi!
</p>
<p>
 When after the Milestone 2 submission deadline will we be assigned Milestone 2s to peer review? Will it be the same topics as we were assigned to peer review before?
</p>
<p>
 Thank you!
</p>

  We are planning to modify the reviewer's form on CMT today. And you can do the review if the group has already submitted their milestone 2.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a high probability, you will be assigned to the same group that you review for milestone 1
