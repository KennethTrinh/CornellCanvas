 HW # 1
</p>
<p>
 As in #36, this discrepancy in the numbers for total population and for poverty levels seems to be messing up the fractional data so that the ratio of those at different levels of income do not sum to 1 as they should. Some are much further off than others, I particularly noticed issues with the Brazil Data.

  There are some (6) records in the poverty data where n_data_550*1000000&gt;population. I've added a note to the top of the HW google doc saying how to handle these records.

  Brazil isn't among these records --- the data for that country looks ok for me. I would double-check your query to see if there are issues that could be causing the negative value for Brazil in 1981.
