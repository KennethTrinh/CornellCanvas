 HW #4

 The question says "
 <b>
  find the 3 rounded pre-tip amounts between $30 and $70 that have the most records associated with them"
 </b>
 . What does "have the most records associated with them" mean? Are we grouping by VendorID or another field, because there are thousands of trips between $30 and $70. Thanks!

  The "most records associated with them" means the most records that also have that rounded pre-tip amount. For example, there may be multiple people that paid $40.0 pre-tip, so 40.0 may have 3, 8, or 10 records associated with it. Thus, you should group by a field that contains the pre-tip info.
