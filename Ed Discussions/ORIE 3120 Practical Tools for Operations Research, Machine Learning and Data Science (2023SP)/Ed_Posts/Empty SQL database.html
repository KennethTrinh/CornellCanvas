  and upload to SQL, the database has no tables when the directions say it should have two tables. I tried redownloading and uploading and have had the same issue. Has anyone else had this problem? Could the link be tested and replaced if it is incorrect?

  I just downloaded this and see the two tables (Demand and WholeNumbers).

  I would recommend downloading this again and making sure that you are adding the database properly and ensuring that there is connection.
