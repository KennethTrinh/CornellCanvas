 Hi, when I download
 <b>
  <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16oCpfK7Fk6d_0g7kG06VNALDRrefSqfM/view?usp=sharing">
   <underline>
    Newsvendor.sqlite
   </underline>
  </a>
 </b>
 and upload to SQL, the database has no tables when the directions say it should have two tables. I tried redownloading and uploading and have had the same issue. Has anyone else had this problem? Could the link be tested and replaced if it is incorrect?
</p>

  I just downloaded this and see the two tables (Demand and WholeNumbers).

  I would recommend downloading this again and making sure that you are adding the database properly and ensuring that there is connection.
