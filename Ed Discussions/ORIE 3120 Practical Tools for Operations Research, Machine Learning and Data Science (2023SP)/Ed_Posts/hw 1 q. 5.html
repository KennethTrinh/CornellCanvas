 Problem # 5
</p>
<p>
 HW #1
</p>
<p>
 This question requires that the values be not null for part a and part b. Does that mean that when a value is null (the first bullet point), then there would be no data present. Since for the data to be corrupt ones have to not be null in order for the corruption to appear, would nothing show up?

  Null value means that no data exists there. The purpose of this question is to show that it is impossible to have the number of people living off less than $1.90 per day be less than the number living off $3.20 per day, if data exists for those two values. Similarly for $3.20 and $5.50.

 <p>
  If data exists where this is not the case, then your data likely doesn't make sense for those records.
