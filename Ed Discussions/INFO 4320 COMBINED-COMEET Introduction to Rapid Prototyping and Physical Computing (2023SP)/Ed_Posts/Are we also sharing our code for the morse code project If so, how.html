  I submitted morse code on Canvas as a URL. The slides also say to submit the code, but I was wondering how we should do this if it's not optional, as it doesn't say to do so on the assignment page. Thank you!

  You need to submit your file on Canvas. Only demo videos should be submitted via URL.

  Just to clarify, Canvas only allow one type of submission in each attempt, so how are we supposed to submit both a file and a URL at the same time?

  Two ways.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  One is to put the URL into a txt file and zip that file with your code into a zip file. Submit the zip file instead.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The other way is to put the URL as the comments.

  No, the code file should be uploaded to Canvas. It should be an Arduino file.
