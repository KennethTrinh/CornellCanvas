 Hi, I was wondering if there were any resources for figuring out how to get CNC motion with belt pulleys. I've seen some previous projects for inspiration but was wondering if I could find more information on how to 3D print parts and how to use the different parts of a pulley kit like the mounting blocks and springs. Thank you!

  This depends on your design. I think the easiest way is to talk to your TA, who should be able to provide more detailed resource for you.
