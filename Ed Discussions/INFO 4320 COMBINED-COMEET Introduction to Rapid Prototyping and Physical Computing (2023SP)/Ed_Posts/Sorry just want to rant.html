 Just when I was about to submit my .ino file in Canvas, I accidentally pressed
 <i>
  cmd + delete
 </i>
 (if you are a Mac user you know what that means) in the file selection page, and the entire sketch folder got deleted. My
 <i>
  Arduino
 </i>
 folder is in my
 <i>
  iCloud Drive
 </i>
 folder, but apparently deleting things in file selection page means the deleted files neither existed in trash can nor iCloud's recently deleted folder. Now I have to rewrite the entire file again. I'm just mad. Thank you for listening to my rant. Have a nice evening!
