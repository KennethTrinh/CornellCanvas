  Just when I was about to submit my .ino file in Canvas, I accidentally pressed
  <italic>
   cmd + delete
  </italic>
  (if you are a Mac user you know what that means) in the file selection page, and the entire sketch folder got deleted. My
  <italic>
   Arduino
  </italic>
  folder is in my
  <italic>
   iCloud Drive
  </italic>
  folder, but apparently deleting things in file selection page means the deleted files neither existed in trash can nor iCloud's recently deleted folder. Now I have to rewrite the entire file again. I'm just mad. Thank you for listening to my rant. Have a nice evening!
