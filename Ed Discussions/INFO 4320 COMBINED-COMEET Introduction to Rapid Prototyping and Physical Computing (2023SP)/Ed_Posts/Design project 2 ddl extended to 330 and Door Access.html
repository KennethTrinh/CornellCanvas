  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  As you are aware, some students and TAs lost access to the lab space yesterday. TAs opened the door and kept it open throughout the day. Additionally, I have submitted an IT ticket to request the building manager to regrant access after class.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  This morning (around 10:30AM), we received reports that the door was closed again, and the students still did not have access. Upon seeing this, TA Yuanchen opened rooms 129 and 114, but he was unable to open room 100 as he also lost access. TA Ruidong came to room 100 and opened it at around 11:55 AM.  All the lab spaces are open now.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I have submitted another urgent IT ticket to request access and sent an urgent email to the administration head regarding this issue. We will do our best to get the access back to you as soon as possible.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  We understand that this unexpected incident might have affected some of your work schedules, so we have decided to extend the deadline for design project 2 by one day. The new deadline is now Thursday, March 30th. We hope this extension helps.

  Thank you.
