  Hi everyone, Iâ€™m looking for 2 group members to make a perler bead printer. The idea is that an image would be received as input, then sized down to something manageable, say 32x32, and color reduced to fit our available bead colors. The machine would then place down the beads in a grid. I imagine this would work similar to a CNC machine, with some form of storage for each color bead. This should certainly work as a viable idea, so if this project sounds fun to you, please email me at ioi3@cornell.edu and we can talk more. Thank you!
