 Is there any specific software we are supposed to use to design cutouts for the laser cutter. I know they have to be exported as pdf files. Are we supposed to use the Inkscape program on the computer connected to the laser cutter or something else?

  Yes we recommend using Inkscape for this course (but other software like Adobe Illustrator is also fine). You can install Inkscape on your computer and save your design as pdf. To laser cut, just send the pdf to the computer in lab.
