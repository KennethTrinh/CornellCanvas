 I can't find this anywhere, but for engraving do we need to change the color or does 0.001 in red still work?

  There is a guideline doc on canvas -&gt; Files-&gt; How to user Laser cutter.pdf.
 </p>
 <p>
  That has more details.

 <p>
  You can assign two different colors to cut and engrave separately. And then assign different power and speed on the laser cutter computer.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you want to engrave on our plywood, I will start with lower power and faster speed.  E.g., 80% speed, 60% power. If it still cuts through, I will further increase the speed, or reduce the power.
 </p>
 <p>
  Let me know how it works. We will send out a more detailed instruction on this shortly.
