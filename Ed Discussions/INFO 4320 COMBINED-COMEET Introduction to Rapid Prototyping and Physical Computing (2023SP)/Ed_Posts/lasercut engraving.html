  I can't find this anywhere, but for engraving do we need to change the color or does 0.001 in red still work?

  There is a guideline doc on canvas -&gt; Files-&gt; How to user Laser cutter.pdf.

  That has more details.

  You can assign two different colors to cut and engrave separately. And then assign different power and speed on the laser cutter computer.

  If you want to engrave on our plywood, I will start with lower power and faster speed.  E.g., 80% speed, 60% power. If it still cuts through, I will further increase the speed, or reduce the power.

  Let me know how it works. We will send out a more detailed instruction on this shortly.
