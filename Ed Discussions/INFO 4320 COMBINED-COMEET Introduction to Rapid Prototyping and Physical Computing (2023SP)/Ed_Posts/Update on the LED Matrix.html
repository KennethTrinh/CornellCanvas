 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 Just want to let you know that we have figured out the solution for the LED matrix with red color. We will post a detailed solution tomorrow. I will also go through it in detail on Wed's class.
</p>
<p>
 Given this issue's negative impact on your progress, we will extend this mini-project deadline until next Wed (
 <b>
  April 26
 </b>
 ).
</p>
<p>
 I apologize for the inconvenience this issue has caused you.

   It will not impact the keypad input mechanism. It will require the input keypad to change a few pins  it uses on ESP32.
