  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Just want to let you know that we have figured out the solution for the LED matrix with red color. We will post a detailed solution tomorrow. I will also go through it in detail on Wed's class.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Given this issue's negative impact on your progress, we will extend this mini-project deadline until next Wed (

  I apologize for the inconvenience this issue has caused you.

  It will not impact the keypad input mechanism. It will require the input keypad to change a few pins  it uses on ESP32.
