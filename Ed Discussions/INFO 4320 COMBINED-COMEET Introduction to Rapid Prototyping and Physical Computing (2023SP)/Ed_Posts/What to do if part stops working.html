 Hello,
</p>
<p>
 I was just working on my LIDAR and when the motor was spinning the isolator now does not output the 9V. According to the multimeter the 3V side still has power and will transmit power over the isolator however the component that creates the 9V has no power output. I lowered the module power setting and I checked and the motor is still pretty cold. Some component on the isolator must have been overworked. What should I do?
</p>

  If you do not have the 9V on the other side, you may want to swtich another isolator. There are some old parts in 114 that you can pick up. I will be in my office until 5PM (244, Gates). You can come here and I will give you a new isolator.
