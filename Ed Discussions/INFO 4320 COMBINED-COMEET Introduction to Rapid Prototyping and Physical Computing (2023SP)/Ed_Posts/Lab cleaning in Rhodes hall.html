  Hi All,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thank you for a great demo session last week.  We will need to clean Rhodes 129 and 100 soon. If you want to keep your team project, please remove them from Rhodes Hall by 5/22.  After this date, we will assume that you do not want these hardware parts and will start cleaning the room.

  BTW, if you have not filled out the class survey and TA survey, please take some time to do so. We would really appreciate your feedback.

  Thank you and have a great summer.
