  Hello,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  As promised during today's class, the teaching schedule for the entire semester has been uploaded on Canvas, located under the "Teaching Schedule" tab. This schedule outlines the teaching plan, along with upcoming deadlines. Please note that this schedule is tentative, and we may make adjustments as necessary.

  Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.

  Would it be possible to allow us to view assignments/projects before they are set to open? Right now all the future assignments are locked and unviewable. Looking at them ahead of time might be helpful for planning or thinking about the assignment before it actually starts. Thanks!
