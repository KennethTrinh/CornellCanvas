 Hi
</p>
<p>
 We put 14 extra filaments for 3D printers at Rhodes 114 as shown in the picture below.

 We are trying to check the status of the printers and replace the filaments every day if they are short.
</p>
<p>
 But if there are no filaments when you want to use the printers, you can also replace them yourself.
</p>
<p>
 Thank you.
