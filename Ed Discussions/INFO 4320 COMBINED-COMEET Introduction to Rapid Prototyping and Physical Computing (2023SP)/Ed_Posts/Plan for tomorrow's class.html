 Hi Everyone,
</p>
<p>
 Tomorrow, we will use the class time to help you form a team and get feedback on your project ideas.
</p>
<p>
 1. If you have not formed a team,  you can use tomorrow's class to discuss with others and join a team.
</p>
<p>
 2. If you have formed a team, we will discuss it with you and provide feedback on your project ideas.
</p>

 2. Filled out the second survey posted on the slides (yesterday).

 3. Formed a project team with a valid project idea.
