  Hello,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  When I plug in my motor to my laptop it runs but does not stop or respond to any kind of code or change speeds. Also it still runs even when removing the wire connecting from PIN 13 to the isolator. Would you happen to know the particular area I should look into to fix this?

  I am totally blanking on what itâ€™s called, but that black box with the three prongs is the issue. They give us two of them in the box but they are NOT the same thing. Make sure you have the right one

  It's hard to debug this situation. Your wiring on the circuit may be the issue. Its hard to debug on hardware without seeing it. Maybe You can go to TA's OH tomorrow to have one of the TA to help take a look.
