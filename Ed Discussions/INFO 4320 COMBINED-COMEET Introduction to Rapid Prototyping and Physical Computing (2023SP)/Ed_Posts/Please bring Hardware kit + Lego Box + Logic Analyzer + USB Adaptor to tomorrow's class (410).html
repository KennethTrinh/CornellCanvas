 Hi All,
</p>
<p>
 I hope you have enjoyed your spring break. Welcome back to Cornell.
</p>
<p>
 Tomorrow, we will work on a project related to more advanced motor control.  Please make sure you bring the following hardware boxes:
</p>
<p>
 1. Hardware box.
</p>
<p>
 2. Lego Box: we will use the Lego blocks to build a structure in this mini-project.
</p>
<p>
 3. Logica Analyzer and USB adaptor (if your computer does not have 2 USB ports).
</p>
<p>
 See you in tomorrow's class!
</p>
<p>
