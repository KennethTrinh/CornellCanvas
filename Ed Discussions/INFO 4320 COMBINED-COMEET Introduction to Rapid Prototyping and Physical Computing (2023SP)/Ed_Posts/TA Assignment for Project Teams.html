 Please find your team number and mentor TA in the document below. TAs will create a
 <b>
  Slack channel
 </b>
 for each team so please join the course Slack ASAP if you have not done so. Besides, you are required to schedule a
 <b>
  weekly project meeting
 </b>
 with your mentor TA to discuss the progress of your project every week. This meeting should start as soon as you know your mentor TA and all team members are expected to attend it.
