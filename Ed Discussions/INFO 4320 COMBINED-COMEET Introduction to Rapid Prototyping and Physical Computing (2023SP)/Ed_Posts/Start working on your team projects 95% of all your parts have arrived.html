 and been put into your boxes. We will distribute the remaining items once they arrive. Given that the first prototype is due in roughly 2 weeks (Mar. 27), please consider working on your team projects as soon as possible.
</p>
<p>
 All of your project parts have been ordered and are arriving these few days. We have created a box for each of your team in Rhodes 100 (see photo).

<p>
 We are actively monitoring the packages and putting them into your team boxes once they arrive. We use this spreadsheet (same as the one you used to order items) to keep track of the items:

 </a>
</p>
<p>
 For convenience of package sorting, we kindly ask you to please keep your boxes at their original places in Rhodes 100 until all of your items have arrived (feel free to take items out to work on them though). Please do not move other teams' boxes. Please also let us know if you find items in your box that you did not order. Thank you for your understanding.
</p>
<p>
 Please let us know if you have any questions.
