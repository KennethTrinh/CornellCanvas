  Is it possible/safe to cut metal with the laser cutter? I have some aluminum rails (

  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0874387ZB?ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_SCAZQNT0HXFSK18QWXD1&amp;th=1) that I need to cut into a smaller size, but I'm not sure how to go about it. If we can use the laser cutter to cut metal, what would the settings be?

  No, our laser cutter cannot cut metal. Please do not put any metal material in it. Unfortunately we do not have automatic machines to cut metal pieces. If you need to cut them, you need to use a handsaw.
