  Hi, everyone
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  According to the email, Cornell will close the campus tomorrow at 3:00 pm due to the winter storm. All classes, exams, and events should be canceled.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  As a result, I will move my OH tomorrow from 3:00 - 4:00 to Wednesday from 1:30 - 2:30 at Rhodes 129. Please stay safe and warm indoors tomorrow.
