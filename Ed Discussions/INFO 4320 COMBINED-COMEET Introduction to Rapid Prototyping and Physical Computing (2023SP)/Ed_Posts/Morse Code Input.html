 So for the Fan Control project, how are we defining a dash? Should we consider a dash holding down the button for a substantial amount of time or rather three dots in quick succesion like the last project?

  I think we need to use the millis() function to determine how long the button is pressed for to distinguish between dots and dashes? And then we need to make sense of the dots and dashes to determine the number/motor speed that correlates to the morse code denoted by the input/button. That's what it seems to be to me but I'm not exactly sure if that's the correct interpretation.

   Well yes I understand that, but should a dash be a long input of the button or three consecutive short inputs. That’s what I don’t understand

    A dash is one input as far as I know... I don't think it is three short ones. Three short ones would be three dots presumably.
