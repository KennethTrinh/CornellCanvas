 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 The first-round hardware order list is due midnight today. Please work closely with your TA on your part lists. The part list is here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VzZPEoIyrY3sbuGVj5omPxQupZOEF80J_rQ1E5No30E/edit?usp=sharing
</p>
<p>
 All orders will be placed tomorrow with no delays. We are actively working on the list you  provided to make sure that they are in stock and ship within reasonable time. In addition to your TA's feedback, I will also perform further checks on all items and leave comments for your reference before they are sent to the department to be ordered.
 <b>
  If you have not put your item list on the spreadsheet, please do so as soon as possible
 </b>
 so that I have time to go through them and correct any issues.
</p>
