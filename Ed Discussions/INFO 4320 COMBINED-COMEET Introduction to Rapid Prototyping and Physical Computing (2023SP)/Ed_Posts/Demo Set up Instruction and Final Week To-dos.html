 We are finally approaching demo day. Here are some instructions for the demo session and final week.

 Your final demo will be the major part we use to grade. However, you may choose to submit supplemental materials (such as demo videos, and pictures) by 5/12.   This is optional, not required.   Details can be found in the canvas assignment.
