<p>
 is there a way to repair the servo motor in our kit? I twisted the metal shaft (the one that protrudes outwards) around when it was unplugged and I think I misaligned it now. I'm going to go to the 11am OH but was wondering if there's anything I can do before then.

  It is hard to repair. There are used ones in Rhodes 114. You can find one to replace yours.
