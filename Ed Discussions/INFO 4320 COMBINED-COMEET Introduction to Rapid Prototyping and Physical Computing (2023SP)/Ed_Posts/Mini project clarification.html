  For this week's mini project, I'm confused about how the morse code ties into the assignment, as well as the millis() function. Are we supposed to input a number from 0-9 in morse code via the button, or are we still using the serial monitor? Are we also supposed to attach a fan to the motor or are we just supposed to show the motor changing speeds? How are we expected to use the millis() function? Thanks.

  We use the button, but the Morse code is a good structure for what happens if we put in a specific number

  You need to use button to input the morse code.

  The output is just the speed of the motor. You do not need to attach any fan on the motor.
