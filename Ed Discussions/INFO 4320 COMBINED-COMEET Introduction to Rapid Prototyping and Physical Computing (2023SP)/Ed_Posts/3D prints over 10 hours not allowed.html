 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 As mentioned in class, 3D prints over long hours have a high chance of failure, which would be a great waste of limited 3D printing resources. We do not encourage you to design and print large structures.
</p>
<p>
 For large
 <b>
  flat/regular shapes
 </b>
 , we recommend using the
 <b>
  laser cutter
 </b>
 , which is not only much faster but also more precise. For large
 <b>
  complicated structures
 </b>
 , we recommend
 <b>
  breaking it down
 </b>
 to different modules and printing them separately, which will give you more flexibility to iterate individual modules instead wasting time reprinting everything.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  3D prints over 10 hours are not allowed
 </b>
 . This rule will be randomly enforced: we will not specifically check the prints. However, if a staff member happens to see a print over 10 hours, he/she will stop the print. If you believe that you do need a large print, talk to your TA and we will make sure it won't be stopped by the staff (if it does not fail itself).
</p>
<p>
 In addition, we have put several SD cards and readers in Rhodes 114 for your convenience. They should not be taken out of 114. Please be considerate while using them and
 <b>
  always put them back
 </b>
 after use.
</p>
<p>
 Please let us know if you have any questions. Have a great weekend.

  Actually, 10 hours is already a very long time to print. It is recommended to  be less than 5-6 hours. If the printing time is longer than this, you should consider :
 </p>
 <p>
  1. Break down your design into multiple prints.
 </p>
 <p>
  2. Use laser cutter to make the design.
