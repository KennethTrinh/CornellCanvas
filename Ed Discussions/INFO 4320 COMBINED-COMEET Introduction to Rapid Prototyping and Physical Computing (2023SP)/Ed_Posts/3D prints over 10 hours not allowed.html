  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  As mentioned in class, 3D prints over long hours have a high chance of failure, which would be a great waste of limited 3D printing resources. We do not encourage you to design and print large structures.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For large
  <bold>
   flat/regular shapes
  </bold>
  , we recommend using the
  <bold>
   laser cutter
  </bold>
  , which is not only much faster but also more precise. For large
  <bold>
   complicated structures
  </bold>
  , we recommend
  <bold>
   breaking it down
  </bold>
  to different modules and printing them separately, which will give you more flexibility to iterate individual modules instead wasting time reprinting everything.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <bold>
   3D prints over 10 hours are not allowed
  </bold>
  . This rule will be randomly enforced: we will not specifically check the prints. However, if a staff member happens to see a print over 10 hours, he/she will stop the print. If you believe that you do need a large print, talk to your TA and we will make sure it won't be stopped by the staff (if it does not fail itself).
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  In addition, we have put several SD cards and readers in Rhodes 114 for your convenience. They should not be taken out of 114. Please be considerate while using them and
  <bold>
   always put them back
  </bold>
  after use.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Please let us know if you have any questions. Have a great weekend.

  Actually, 10 hours is already a very long time to print. It is recommended to  be less than 5-6 hours. If the printing time is longer than this, you should consider :
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1. Break down your design into multiple prints.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. Use laser cutter to make the design.
