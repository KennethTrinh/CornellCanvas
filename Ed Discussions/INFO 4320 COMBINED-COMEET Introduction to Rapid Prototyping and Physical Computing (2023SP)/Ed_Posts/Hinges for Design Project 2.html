 The project description states that "the box and all the mechanisms must be build using a laser cutter." If I wanted to open and close a lid on the box, can we 3d print or a hinge, or do we have to laser cut a hinge as well?

  You should laser cut the hinges. Actually, it should be easier to laser cut the hinges than 3D printing. There are structures like the one in the image that can be easily cut with a laser cutter.
