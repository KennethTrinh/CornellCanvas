  I was just wondering if we have all of the info to sufficiently start the miniproject on our own. Or should we wait until after Wednesdays class?

  Yes. You are actually expected to start working on this mini project from Monday. All information are already presented today. This wed will be used to answer any question that students may have on the assignment.
