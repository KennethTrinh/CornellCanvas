  There are no specific size requirements. However, the implied requirements are:
 </p>
 <p>
  1. The motor needs to be inside the box.
 </p>
 <p>
  2. You only have 1 piece of plywood.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hope this helps.

   To clarify, does "inside the box" also include being put in a hole on the outside of the box? Such as in the Darth Vader example.

    Per the requirements "The animation mechanism should be inside the box". If only part of the servo is outside and main mechanism is inside, this should also be ok. However, if you can hide everything inside, that would of course be better.
