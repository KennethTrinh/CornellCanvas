  Hello,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Please remember to bring a USB adapter to class if your laptop does not have a USB type-A interface. In this course, you need at least 2 USB type-A interfaces on your laptop (on Monday's class you only need one). Please make sure to prepare in advance if you do not have them.
