  Hi,

  Given the upcoming deadlines next week, we will not teach new content tomorrow. Instead, we will use them to support you in working on your mini-project, design project, or team project.  Please use this time as an opportunity to solicit feedback on your projects.

   You are expected to attend the class (at Phillips Hall) and work on your projects during the class period.
