 I want to use the passive buzzer in our sensor kit for design project 1 to generate sounds of different pitches. It seems that the API required
 <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/advanced-io/tone/">
  tone(pin, frequency, duration)
  is not directly available with ESP32 boards. I did found a library (
  <link href="https://github.com/madhephaestus/ESP32Servo"/>
  ESP32Servo
 </a>
 ) to use this API but not sure if this is okay to use. What would be the recommended way to go about this?
