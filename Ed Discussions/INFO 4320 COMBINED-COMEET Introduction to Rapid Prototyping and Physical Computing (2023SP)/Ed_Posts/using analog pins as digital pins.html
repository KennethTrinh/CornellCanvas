  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I was wondering if there's a way to use analog pins as digital pins (in my case for controlling the RGB led)-- I've used up most of my digital pins to connect the 1602A LCD display, and when I try to connect both the display and led to the same pins they end up interfering with eachother.

  You should have a driver board for the LCD module. With that module, you only need the SDA and SCL pins on your ESP32 for LCD, no other pins are needed. You can refer to the slides for detailed instructions.

  On the question itself, I believe you can use analog pins as digital pins with no problem.

  We will teach how to use the LCD display in week 9 (3/20).  If you email me, I am happy to share the slides with you now.  You need a driver module (in your box) to get this working.
