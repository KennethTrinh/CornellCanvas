 Note there are 50 items total marked on 7 pictures. Please check if you received the exact number of parts in your hardware kits. If you find anything missing, please
 <b>
  come to one of the TAs during class this Wednesday (Feb 1)
 </b>
 , we will make up for your missing items.
</p>
<p>
 Beyond this Wednesday, you are expected to keep your own hardware kits throughout the semester. If you lose any items later in the semester, you are likely to find replacements for most items from leftovers from previous semesters in Rhodes 114. If you cannot find replacements, we can provide you with the link we used to purchase the original items. To make sure that you have the hardware for a smooth semester, please check your hardware kits carefully and keep your hardware safe throughout the semester.
</p>
<p>
 Please also note that there may be variations of parts, such as some parts may not have an outer package, or some parts may be slightly different in size. This is because items may come from different vendors or batches. They have similar prices and the teaching team has verified that they are inter-replaceable.
