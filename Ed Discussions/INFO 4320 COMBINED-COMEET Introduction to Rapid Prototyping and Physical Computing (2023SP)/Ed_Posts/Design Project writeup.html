  How detailed does the write up have to be? Do we have to explain our code and the implementation of the system or just provide a description of how the user interacts with the system?

  You don't need to provide a detailed explanation of your code.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Instead, simply list the system functions on how you satisfy the requirements E.g.,  analog and digital input and output. Then, describe the system's functions and how users can interact with it. Keep in mind that this write-up should be brief, with a expected maximum length of 1-2 pages.
