 Hello,
</p>
<p>
 For the second design project, the Canvas submission deadline is March 29 at midnight, the Canvas description says March 31 at midnight, and Ed Discussion says March 30 at midnight. I'm assuming the Ed discussion update is correct, but I want to make sure the Canvas assignment isn't going to lock tomorrow tonight? Could we get some clarification/consistency for the deadline? Thank you!
</p>

  The correct deadline (March 30) is updated on Canvas now. Sorry for the confusion!
