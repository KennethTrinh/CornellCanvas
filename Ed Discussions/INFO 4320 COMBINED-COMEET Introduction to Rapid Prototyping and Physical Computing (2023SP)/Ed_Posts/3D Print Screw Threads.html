 I recently tried 3D printing a piece that included a hole with threads for an M3 screw. However, when I printed it out, none of the threads were printed. I double-checked the Fusion 360 file, and the threads are definitely there.
</p>
<p>
 Is there a fix around this (like maybe printing at a higher refinement)?

  Our 3D printers do not have high enough resolution to print out such small threads reliably. Even if they do, the material would not be strong enough to support weight using the tiny threads.
 </p>
 <p>
  My suggestion is using metal M3 nuts instead and using 3D printed structures to incorporate the nuts into your design.
