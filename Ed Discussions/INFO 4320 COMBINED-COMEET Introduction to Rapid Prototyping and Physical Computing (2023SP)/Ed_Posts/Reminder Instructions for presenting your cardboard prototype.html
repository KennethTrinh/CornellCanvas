  Hi all,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  We will use this Wednesday's session (Mar. 8) to present your cardboard prototypes and get feedbacks. The 16 teams in the class will be divided in two groups. The teaching staff will also be divided in two groups to watch your presentations respectively. The classroom will be divided in two areas as well. Teams in
  <bold>
   group 1
  </bold>
  <bold>
   will sit
  </bold>
  in the row
  <bold>
   closer to the blackboard
  </bold>
  . Teams in
  <bold>
   group 2 will sit
  </bold>
  in the row
  <bold>
   closer to the windows
  </bold>
  .
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Please bring your cardboard prototype to the classroom in advance. To reserve some time to setup the prototype, please arrive at least
  <bold>
   5 minutes before the class begins
  </bold>
  . The two groups will start in parallel. We will go through each team in the group one by one. Each team has
  <bold>
   5 minutes
  </bold>
  , including
  <bold>
   3 minutes for presentation and 2 minutes for questions/comments
  </bold>
  . Since we only have limited time in class, this time limit will be
  <bold>
   strictly enforced
  </bold>
  . The teams are divided as:
