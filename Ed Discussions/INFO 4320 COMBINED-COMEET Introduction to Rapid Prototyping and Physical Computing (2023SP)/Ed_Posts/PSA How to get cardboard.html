  Hello, I just wanted to pop in here and say do NOT SPEND MONEY on cardboard for your prototype. Many stores will give you their trash cardboard boxes if you ask them nicely.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  “Hi I need cardboard for a school project I’m working on, I was wondering do you have any old boxes you were going to throw away that I can take off your hands?”
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  This took me 3 stores before I had armfuls of cardboard, and only about 15 minutes. Hope this helps!
