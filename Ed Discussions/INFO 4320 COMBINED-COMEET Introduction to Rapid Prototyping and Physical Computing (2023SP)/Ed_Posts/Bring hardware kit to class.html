 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 Please bring your hardware kit (excluding the Lego kit) to the classroom tomorrow. It's expected that you bring the hardware kit to each class unless otherwise stated.
</p>
<p>
 Tomorrow, we'll start by teaching new content, then use the remainder of class to answer questions about the first mini project.
</p>
