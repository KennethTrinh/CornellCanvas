  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Please bring your hardware kit (excluding the Lego kit) to the classroom tomorrow. It's expected that you bring the hardware kit to each class unless otherwise stated.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Tomorrow, we'll start by teaching new content, then use the remainder of class to answer questions about the first mini project.
