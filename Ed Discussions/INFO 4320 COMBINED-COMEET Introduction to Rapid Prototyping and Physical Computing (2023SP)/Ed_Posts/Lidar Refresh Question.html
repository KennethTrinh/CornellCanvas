  Hello,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I have the lidar working but it just stays still in the processing. I see dots so I am pretty sure it is right and when I close out the program and open it back up the dots have changed position to reflect the new angle and range. Is there any way to see it update instantly, is this a problem with me sending too much data at once even though I am waiting for character 'N' to be sent?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thank you so much

  Do you mean that you only see one dot unless you close the program and reopen it? That is not the correct behavior. Waiting for an 'N' before sending info is expected, but the dots should appear instantly on the screen.

  The LIDAR in this assignment is meant to sense static objects in the environment. The dots will not disappear once it appears on the screen. This is expected behavior.

  From your description it is difficult to understand the exact issue. Feel free to go to one of the OHs to get more specific help.
