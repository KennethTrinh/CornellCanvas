 Should there be a pause in between dots/dashes? For example, for '1' the LED should light up in the pattern dot dash dash dash dash. In between the dots/dashes should there be a delay/LED turn off to indicate its not just one long dash?

  yes.  It was described in the slides "• A space between parts of the same letter is equal to one dot". You can pause for a length of one dot between dots/dashes.
