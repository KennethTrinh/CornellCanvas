 The links on the slides for the printer webpages are broken. Are there new ones we can access?

  The link for each printer is written on a note attached to the printer, as discussed in class.

  These addresses have been updated by the staff.  BTW, please do not print remotely.  You should not leave until the first layer print finish .

   Some of the printers won't connect when you type in the IP address. For example 14 and 33
