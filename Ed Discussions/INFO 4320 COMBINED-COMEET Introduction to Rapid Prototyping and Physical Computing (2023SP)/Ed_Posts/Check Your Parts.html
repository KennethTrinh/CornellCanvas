 Hi all,
</p>
<p>
 We got some parts from the second order. The parts were sorted for each group in Rhodes 100. You can take them. (See figure below)

 Please check the parts before you pick them up. We already marked all parts with group numbers (e.g., T10 for group 10).

 Some of them have not arrived yet. You can check which parts arrived here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Vn262EN0OL1Q2zfmbdb-VDoOWPD7j0zoz3_cTcVHywA/edit?usp=sharing
