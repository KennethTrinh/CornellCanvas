  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  As announced during class, most of your hardware orders have been delivered. TA has already sorted the parts into teams at Rhodes 100. Please pick up your hardware and inform your TA of what hardware is still missing by
  <bold>
   4PM, 4/21.
  </bold>
  So that we have time to help track where the missing order is.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  After tomorrow's deadline, if you do not inform your TA of the missing hardware order,
  <bold>
   we will assume you have received all your hardware parts.
  </bold>

  Thank you.
