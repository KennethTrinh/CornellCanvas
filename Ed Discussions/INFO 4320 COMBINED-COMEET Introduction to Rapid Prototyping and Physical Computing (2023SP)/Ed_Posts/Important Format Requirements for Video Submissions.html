  Would a .txt file thatâ€™s a link to the YouTube video work?

  The goal of this rule is not to create difficulty for students, but to make it easier for the staff during grading. There's no need to worry as long as you demonstrate effort to follow the rules. We will also let you know of any problematic formats before applying any penalty. Again, we do not mean to create extra difficulty for you. I hope this helps relieve your anxiety.

  I did not see this post before submitting my mini projects for the last two weeks (I uploaded a zip). Is it possible to resubmit the files separately?
