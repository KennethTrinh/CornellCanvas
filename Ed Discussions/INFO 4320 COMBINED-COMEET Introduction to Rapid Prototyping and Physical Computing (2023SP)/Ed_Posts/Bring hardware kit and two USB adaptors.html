 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 We will work on reading sensor values using I2C and SPI communication tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
 Please bring your
 <b>
  hardware kit
 </b>
 (no Lego needed) and adaptors with
 <b>
  two USB ports (one for ESP32 and one for the logic analyzer)
 </b>
 .   Because we will use the logic analyzer to read the signals in the circuit.
</p>
<p>
 See you in tomorrow's class.
</p>
