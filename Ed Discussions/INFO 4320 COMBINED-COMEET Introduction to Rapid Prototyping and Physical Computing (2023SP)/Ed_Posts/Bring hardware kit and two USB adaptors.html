  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  We will work on reading sensor values using I2C and SPI communication tomorrow.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Please bring your
  <bold>
   hardware kit
  </bold>
  (no Lego needed) and adaptors with
  <bold>
   two USB ports (one for ESP32 and one for the logic analyzer)
  </bold>
  .   Because we will use the logic analyzer to read the signals in the circuit.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  See you in tomorrow's class.
