  1.  Many of you have not used the permit code to enroll in the course, please do it ASAP.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. We will give a hardware box to each student who is accepted or conditional accepted.

   Bring USB port adaptors to the class
  </bold>
  as TA (Ruidong ) posted: Please remember to bring a USB adapter to class if your laptop does not have a USB type-A interface. In this course, you need at least 2 USB type-A interfaces on your laptop (in Monday's class, you only need one).

  See you tomorrow.
