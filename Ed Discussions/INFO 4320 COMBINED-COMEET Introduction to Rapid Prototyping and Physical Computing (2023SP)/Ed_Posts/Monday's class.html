 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 In tomorrow's class, we will start working on hardware.  A few reminders:
</p>
<p>
 1.  Many of you have not used the permit code to enroll in the course, please do it ASAP.
</p>
<p>
 2. We will give a hardware box to each student who is accepted or conditional accepted.
 <b>
  If you no longer want to take the course, please let me know ASAP.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 3.
 <b>
  Bring USB port adaptors to the class
 </b>
 as TA (Ruidong ) posted: Please remember to bring a USB adapter to class if your laptop does not have a USB type-A interface. In this course, you need at least 2 USB type-A interfaces on your laptop (in Monday's class, you only need one).
</p>
<p>
 See you tomorrow.
</p>
