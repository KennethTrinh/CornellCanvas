 Hi All,
</p>
<p>
 We will have our last class tomorrow, meeting at
 <b>
  Rhodes Hall (114, 129, 100)
 </b>
 to work on the team project together.  TA and I will be there to provide support and feedback on your team project.
</p>
<p>
 I understand that you will be busy at the end of the semester. So
 <b>
  It is critical to attend
 </b>
 the class and use the class time to work on the team project tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
 See you in class.
</p>
