 Hi there,
</p>
<p>
 I just wanted to send reminders:
</p>
<list style="ordered">
 <li>
  <p>
   1. Kindly ensure that you have installed Fusion 360 before Monday's class. This software will be necessary for us to design 3D objects in a step-by-step manner.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   2. The deadline for submitting Design Project One is tomorrow (Mar 6). It's worth noting that this project carries a significant weightage in the final grade. By fulfilling the basic requirements of the project, you can secure at least 80% of the grade, which is much better than being late or not submitting it at all.
  </p>
 </li>
</list>
<p>
 See you in class tomorrow.
</p>
