  Hi there,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I just wanted to send reminders:
 </paragraph>
 <list style="ordered">
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    1. Kindly ensure that you have installed Fusion 360 before Monday's class. This software will be necessary for us to design 3D objects in a step-by-step manner.
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    2. The deadline for submitting Design Project One is tomorrow (Mar 6). It's worth noting that this project carries a significant weightage in the final grade. By fulfilling the basic requirements of the project, you can secure at least 80% of the grade, which is much better than being late or not submitting it at all.

 </list>

  See you in class tomorrow.
