 For todayâ€™s presentation order, we will put tags on each table representing the order.

 The table is first come first serve so student coming earlier can have more choices for order.

 We recommend every group come

  5 to 10 minutes earlier
 </b>
 to set up the hardware.

  Reminder: Each team has 8 minutes (6min presentation + 2min Q&amp;A).
