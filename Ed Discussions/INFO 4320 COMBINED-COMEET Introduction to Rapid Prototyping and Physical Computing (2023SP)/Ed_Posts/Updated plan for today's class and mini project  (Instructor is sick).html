 Hi All,
</p>
<p>
 As you are aware, I was traveling in Europe last week and returned yesterday. While there, I developed a runny nose, sore throat, and cough (occasionally). I have tested negative for COVID, and I am hopeful that my symptoms will disappear today so that I can teach in person. Unfortunately, even though I am recovering, I am still experiencing some symptoms.
</p>
<p>
 To act out of an abundance of caution (e.g., not bring the virus to class),  I decided to stay at home today.  I have adjusted the teaching plan as followed:
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  1.  Today's teaching plan:
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 a)  We will use today's class time as a
 <b>
  workshop session
 </b>
 (similar to last week), where you will work on your design project 3 and team project in Rhodes Hall.  We will not meet in Phillips Hall today. TAs will be in Rhodes Hall to support you.
</p>
<p>
 b )  I will be available to meet during class time (2:40PM - 5:10PM) via Zoom today:
 <a href="https://cornell.zoom.us/j/96295544875?pwd=T1ZsSHptSzFqMXJvaHk1eGtJRjN2UT09">

 </a>
</p>

  2. This week's Mini project:
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 a ) This week's mini-project will be
 <b>
  optional
 </b>
 . If you have finished all previous mini-projects with perfect grades, you can skip this week's mini-project without hurting your grade. If you do submit this mini-project, we will drop one of the lowest grades among all your mini-project submissions.
</p>
<p>
 b)  The complexity of this week's mini-project has been significantly reduced ( more than half of it has been removed).   You only need to work on building a digital level using an accelerometer and LCD Display.  Details have been uploaded on canvas.
</p>
<p>
 c) I will
 <b>
  go through this mini-project on Wednesday.
 </b>
 All slides, demo videos, and sample codes have been uploaded on Canvas. You are welcome to start working on it early, because you should already have all the required skills to work on this mini-project (I2C).
</p>
<p>
 d) The deadline for this optional mini-project has been extended to next
 <b>
  Sunday 5/14
 </b>
 .  So that you can focus on your team project and design project in the next 2 weeks.
</p>
<p>
 Thanks for your understanding and please let me know if you have any questions.

  I hope you feel better! Does that mean everything should be graded by now?

   Most should have been graded by TAs by now. But we may have a few left.  Feel free to shoot me a msg if you have question in any of the grading.
