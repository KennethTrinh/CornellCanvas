 Are we allowed to use more than one of each type of input for the design project? On Canvas it says that:
</p>
<list style="unordered">
 <li>
  <p>
   The device should use one Digital input;
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   The device should use one Analog input;
  </p>
 </li>
</list>
<p>
 I thought it said at least one of each so I ended up using multiple Analog inputs while further editing my design, but I realised now that it only says one. If we're restricted to one, then I'll just revise my design again.

  Yes. You can use more than one of each type.
