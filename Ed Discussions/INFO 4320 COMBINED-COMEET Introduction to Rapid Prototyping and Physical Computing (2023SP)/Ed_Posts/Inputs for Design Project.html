  Are we allowed to use more than one of each type of input for the design project? On Canvas it says that:
 </paragraph>
 <list style="unordered">
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    The device should use one Digital input;
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    The device should use one Analog input;
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
 </list>
 <paragraph>
  I thought it said at least one of each so I ended up using multiple Analog inputs while further editing my design, but I realised now that it only says one. If we're restricted to one, then I'll just revise my design again.
