  Hi, was wondering if we needed to use an ESP32 feather for the project since using something like an Arduino Uno would make finding CNC shields much more convenient

  If this is for your team project, it is not strictly required. However, ESP32 would provide all functions that Arduino Uno has.  Unless you justify why you must use Arduino Uno, we highly recommend you use ESP32 and save the fund for other purchases.

  Thank you for the speedy response! I'm only considering using an Uno since I know of CNC shields which can simplify the wiring/code needed for controlling stepper motors. Do you know of any similar things for ESP32? Of course, if from your experience CNC shields are not needed, it may be worth saving.

  I probably need a bit more information on this before I can help further.

  I would recommend you talking to your TA and see what your TA suggests. TA will have much more detailed information on your team to make a recommendation.
