 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 Due to the high demand for assistance on Fridays, I will be moving my office hours from Thursday 3-4 pm to Fridays 2-3 pm for the remainder of the semester, starting next week.
</p>
<p>
 I will still be holding my office hours today from 3-4 pm. However, starting next week, I will hold office hours from 1-3 pm on Fridays.
</p>
<p>
 My office hours will be held in Rhodes 100.
</p>
<p>
 Thank you.
</p>
