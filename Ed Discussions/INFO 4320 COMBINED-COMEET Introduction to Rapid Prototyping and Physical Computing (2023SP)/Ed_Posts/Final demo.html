  Hi. I see the final demo is this Thursday from 2-4. Do we have to prepare anything other than our project being functional and working? Like is there a report or slides due we need to know about?

  Only the demo is required.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  You do not need to submit any reports or slides.  The grading will be based on the demo we see during that session.

 <paragraph>
  We also understand that demos may not always work at their best during demo session. Therefore, If there are additional materials that you want to share with us (e.g., pre-recorded demo videos, description notes), you can upload them to Canvas.

  I will send out detailed instructions very soon.
