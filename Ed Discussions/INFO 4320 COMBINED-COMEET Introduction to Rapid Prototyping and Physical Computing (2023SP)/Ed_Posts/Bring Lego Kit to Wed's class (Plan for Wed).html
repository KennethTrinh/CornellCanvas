  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I hope you are enjoying your break.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Please bring your Lego kit to the classroom on Wed. We will work on the last part of the moving mechanism with the lego Kit in the first half of the class.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The rest of the class time will be used to answer your questions and give you feedback on your design project  1 (interactive lights) and your team project.
