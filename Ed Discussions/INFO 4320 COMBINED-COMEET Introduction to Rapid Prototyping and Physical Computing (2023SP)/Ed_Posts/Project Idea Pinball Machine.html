 Hi!
</p>
<p>
 I'm thinking of making a pinball machine as a project that will use mechanical and electric components to control the flippers and other parts of the pinball board. Potentially something like the space pinball game.

 I'm looking for 1-2 more people that would be interested in working on this as well. If you're interested, please email me at ap724@cornell.edu!
