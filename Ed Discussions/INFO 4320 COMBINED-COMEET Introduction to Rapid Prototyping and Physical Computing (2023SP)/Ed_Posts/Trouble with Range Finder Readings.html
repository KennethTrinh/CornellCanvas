  Hello,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I am having some difficulties with the readings from my rangefinder. As I hold it steady the readings fluctuate within 14 cm (see graph, it fluctuates between 52 and 66) which is too variable for my code to function properly. Is there any way to reduce this noise?

  The sensor does not work when the distance is shorter than 15 cm.

  I am aware of that but the distance I was testing was larger than 15cm. The range finder kept fluctuating between 52cm and 66cm and was not giving me steady readings. How can I fix this?

  Its hard to debug with limited info. I would encourage you to go to one of the OH to get more help there.
