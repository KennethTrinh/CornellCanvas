 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 Our SciFi Lab is currently recruiting participants
 <b>
  this weekend and next Monday
 </b>
 for our research project: using commercial headsets to recognize silent speech.
</p>
<p>
 Please note that this is not relevant to the course, but your help is greatly appreciated!
</p>
<p>
 During the experiment, we will ask you to wear a pair of slightly modified commercial headsets (Bose QC 45) and silently mouth commands according to instructions on the screen while we play music through the headsets. The study should last
 <b>
  40-50 minutes
 </b>
 and you will receive
 <b>
  $15 compensation
 </b>
 for completing the study. The study will take place at
 <b>
  G29 Gates Hall
 </b>
 .
</p>
<p>
