  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Our SciFi Lab is currently recruiting participants
  <bold>
   this weekend and next Monday
  </bold>
  for our research project: using commercial headsets to recognize silent speech.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Please note that this is not relevant to the course, but your help is greatly appreciated!
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  During the experiment, we will ask you to wear a pair of slightly modified commercial headsets (Bose QC 45) and silently mouth commands according to instructions on the screen while we play music through the headsets. The study should last
  <bold>
   40-50 minutes
  </bold>
  and you will receive
  <bold>
   $15 compensation
  </bold>
  for completing the study. The study will take place at
  <bold>
   G29 Gates Hall
  </bold>
  .
