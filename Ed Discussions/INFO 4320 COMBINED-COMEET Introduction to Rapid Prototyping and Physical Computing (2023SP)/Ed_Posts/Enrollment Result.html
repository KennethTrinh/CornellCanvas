  Dear All,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  After a thorough review of all applications and discussions among the teaching team, we have made difficult decisions to finalize the enrollment process. The results can be found in the Google Doc linked below.

 <list style="ordered">

   <paragraph>
    If your name is not on the list, unfortunately, you will not be able to enroll in the course this semester. You should have received an email from me earlier today. However, you will be given priority enrollment for the fall semester if you are still interested in taking the course.
   </paragraph>

   <paragraph>
    If your name is on the list and your team has at least three members, you may enroll in the course. A TA will contact you to provide a permit code for enrollment today or tomorrow.

    If your name is on the list but your team has fewer than three members, your enrollment is

     conditional

    .
    <bold>
     You will not receive the permit code until you form a team
    </bold>
    with at least three members (by adding members, joining other teams, or forming a new team) before Wednesday's class (3:45 PM, 2/1). Once you have a team, please email us to declare the results. We will then provide you with the permit code for enrollment. If you are unable to form a team by that time, you may not be able to take this course this semester.

  Thank you for your patience. We will begin removing students from Ed and Canvas who are not enrolled after next Wednesday.
