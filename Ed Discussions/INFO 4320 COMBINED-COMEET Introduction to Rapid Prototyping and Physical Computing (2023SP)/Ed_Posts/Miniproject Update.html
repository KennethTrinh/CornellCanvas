 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 I have revised the mini-project for this week to lower the complexity.  Instead of showing Keypad + LED Matrix together, the updated mini-project only requires you to demonstrate each component separately.
</p>
<p>
 The details of the mini-project have been updated on Canvas.
</p>

  Solution for RED Color LED Matrix:

</p>
<p>
 I also have updated the slides (Cavans) which include the solution for the red color LED matrix. I will talk about this solution in today's class shortly.
</p>
<p>
 See you in class.
