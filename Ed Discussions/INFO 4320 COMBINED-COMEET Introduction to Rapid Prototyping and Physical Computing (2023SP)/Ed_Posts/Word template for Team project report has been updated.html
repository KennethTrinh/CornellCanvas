 I was told that the link to the word template for the team project report does not work anymore.
</p>
<p>
 I have updated the link to the word template for the submission on Canvas. The template file can also be found in the "File" folder on Canvas.
</p>
<p>
 Please let me know if you have any further question or issue on using this template.
