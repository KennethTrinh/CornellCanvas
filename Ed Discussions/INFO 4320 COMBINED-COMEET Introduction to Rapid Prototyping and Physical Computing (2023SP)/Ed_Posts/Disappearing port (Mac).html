 I have been working with the microcontroller with no issues until earlier today. For the past hour, my port connection has been disappearing if I put the microcontroller into the breadboard. It is still visible and I can still upload programs if I do not insert it into the breadboard, but it's not useful outside of the circuit. I was using it without issue earlier today so I'm not sure what could have changed. I've double checked my driver and USB cable/port connections (tried my other ports and other adapters) so I know that that isn't the cause. Is there any reason why this could be happening or anything else I should try?

  This is usually caused my errors in your circuit connection on the breadboard. Please double check on all wires on the breadboard or bring it to one of the OHs.

   Somewhere in the circuit may have a short circuit.
