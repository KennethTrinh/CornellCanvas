  Is it ok if our card sorting final decision has not changed from our original card sorting? Are we expected to change some content organization from our 1300 project?

  You should still do iterations of card sorting using the persona. It's possible that you end up with the same organization as 1300. However, please note it won't be 100% identical because there is the form and confirmation page. Please justify your organization for your persona.
