 One of my nav pages on my website links directly to a PDF of my resume. I am trying to do custom routing for it, but it is not working. I have put the PDF in the "public" folder. Am I doing this correctly?

  All static resources are served from the public folder. A PDF is a static resource.

  I hope that helps!
