  Hello,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I tried going to multiple office hours and my CSS file seems to not load into my website. It worked correctly before when router was implemented but it doesn't work anymore. The TA's said that the file path is correct and they can't seem to find the issue. How should I go about this?

  Thank you!

  I would suggest checking the steps from the class notes. Check to see if you're missing anything.

  I would also suggest you check post #133 because it might also be the same issue.
