  I saw the canvas announcement that stated all website content should
  <underline>
   not
  </underline>
  be hard coded. However, to put the form entries into the database using a SQL INSERT statement, and to do form validation (for example, one of my inputs must be &lt; 5) I have hardcoded those parameters. Is this allowed?

  No form validation is required for this project. So I'm guessing this isn't necessary. But I would need to understand your case or see your code to know for sure.

  For example, if I wanted to store the form values into an array, how would I know if the form value should be cast to an (int) or a (bool) if I am just iterating through the fields of the table using a for loop?

  I would need to see your case to be able to better answer this question. Note, that the form values are already in an array:
  <code>
   $_GET
  </code>
  or
  <code>
   $_POST
  </code>
  are both arrays.
