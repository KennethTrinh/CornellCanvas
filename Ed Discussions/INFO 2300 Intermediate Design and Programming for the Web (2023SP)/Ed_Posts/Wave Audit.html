  For the Wave Audit, is it okay to have a few accessibility alerts but no actual accessibility errors?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I found a few alerts which I feel do not carry much impact, will I lose points on my project if I don't resolve it?

  Yes, a few accessibility alerts are fine.

  But, you need to fix all accessibility errors, including contrast errors for each page.
