 For the Wave Audit, is it okay to have a few accessibility alerts but no actual accessibility errors?
</p>
<p>
 I found a few alerts which I feel do not carry much impact, will I lose points on my project if I don't resolve it?

  Yes, a few accessibility alerts are fine.
 </p>
 <p>
  But, you need to fix all accessibility errors, including contrast errors for each page.
