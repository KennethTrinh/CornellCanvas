 Since we only need 3 tables for this final project, can we leave features on our websites that are beyond the 3 tables non-functional (i.e. shopping cart, purchase buttons).

  This is technically okay. However, this can make grading difficult and sometimes causes grading issues/mistakes. You've got two options:
 </p>
 <p>
  1. Leave out the extra features for the project, and then add them after you submit your project. No concerns with the approach.
 </p>
 <p>
  2. Add in the advanced features now and communicate in the design journey what's not implemented. Make it
  <b>
   very
  </b>
  clear in the design journey what you want us to grade and what should not be graded. Understand that mistakes may happen, and that you may need to submit a regrade request.
