  For deletion, is it possible to create a dialog box to confirm whether the user wants to delete an entry without using Javascript?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If not, is it okay if there's no confirmation?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thank you!

  It's possible,  you'll need to use PHP to render it. The idea is when the user clicks delete, use conditional output to show a form that says do you want to delete this? If the form is submitted, then delete the record.

  No confirmation is required for delete.
