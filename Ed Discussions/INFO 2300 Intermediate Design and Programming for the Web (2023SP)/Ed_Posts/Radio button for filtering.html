  Hello, I was trying to use radio buttons for the filtering of catalog entries, and was wondering whether there's a way to determine whether a button is selected without submitting a form?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If not, is it better to use the &lt;a&gt; element instead?

  You can use JavaScript for this, but that's not required. For the sake of time, I encourage you hold close to the project's requirements and simply add a "Filter" button to your radio button filter form. It will take you less time than using JavaScript.
