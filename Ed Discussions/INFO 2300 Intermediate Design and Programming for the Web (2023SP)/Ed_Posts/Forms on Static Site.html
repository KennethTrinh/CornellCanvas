 Is it okay if the static website we are using has a form that we created in Info 1300? I took Info 1300 a while ago when we were including forms and I'm wondering if I can still use this site for project 1?

  Yes, you may use this website. However, for Milestone 3 requirements, you need to design and code a new form. Your form must be original work for this class for credit. Otherwise, this is likely an academic integrity concern.
