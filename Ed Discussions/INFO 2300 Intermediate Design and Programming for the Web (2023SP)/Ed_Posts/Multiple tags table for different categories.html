  Would I lose points if I have multiple tags tables instead of one big one?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I have different categories of tags like age, color, gender, etc, which I have made into their own individual table. I connected them all to my entries-tag table. For my filter, I have it so that you can select multiple options all at the same time.

  I found it easier to implement my filter if I have different tag tables. Is it a requirement to have 1 big tag table?

  Yes, you will lose points if you have multiple tags tables. You should have one tag table as the milestone feedback has consistently reinforced.
