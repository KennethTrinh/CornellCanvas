 Im still a little confused on the filtering. I understand we should hard code the values into our code but does that mean when we use http build query to direct us to another page and if we are? Are we supposed to use sort = parameter?

  You should

  hard code any values into your project.
 </p>
 <p>
  You don't need a sort parameter. Sorting isn't required for this project. You need a query string parameter for whatever type of data you're using to customize a page. Please review the activity repository as an example or the class notes from the query string lecture.

   What activity repo? I have reviewed the one from class-18 but am still confused. I understand we cannot hard code data but then how are we supposed to only show certain items?

    The query string and hidden inputs class activity repository:
    <a href="https://canvas.cornell.edu/courses/46896/assignments/466488?module_item_id=1838405">
     https://canvas.cornell.edu/courses/46896/assignments/466488?module_item_id=1838405
    </a>
   </p>
   <p>
    To only show certain items, you just need to customize a page. We did this in the query string activity. See the activity repository as an example (do the comparison in GitHub as I demo'd earlier in the semester and last week).
