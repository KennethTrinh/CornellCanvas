 On my project 2 form, one of the questions is the user's phone number. I remember in class that you mentioned phone numbers have different formats and lengths depending on what part of the world you're in, so is the only way to check if it's a valid phone number to see if it's empty so my form is user-friendly? Or am I missing something to check?

  No. There is no valid way to check for valid phone numbers. The recommendation from Mozilla is not to validate phone numbers. For Project 2, you should check if the user gave a phone number or not (empty).
