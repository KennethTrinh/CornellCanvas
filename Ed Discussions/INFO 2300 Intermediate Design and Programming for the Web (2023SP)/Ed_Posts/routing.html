  Recalling what you did in lab 1, you should not only change the file types, but also update any links in your code to reflect the changes of file names.

  is this all we have to do or do we also have to write PHP code in our files? For example, &lt;?php include('xxx.php'); ?&gt;

  I think for project 1 milestone 1, you are not required to write PHP code in your files. You will write PHP code in later assignments.
