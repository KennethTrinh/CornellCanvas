 If i had 11 tags, I'm filtering by. When I make my filtering form, do I need to use a foreach to loop through each tag to decide which section of my form they go in, or am I able to hard code them and section them with divs?

  You need to retrieve all data, including tags, from the database. You should not hard code any content, like tags.
