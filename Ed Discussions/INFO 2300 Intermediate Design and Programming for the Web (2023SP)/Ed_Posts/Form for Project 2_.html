  How can I implement a form to add new entries if my catalog is more of a dictionary/wikipedia table? I was inspired by the example provided in the project description but I'm stuck on what to ask in my form (in a realistic perspective) to allow my users to add their own information to an informative database.

  You might simply add a form to insert entries into the dictionary. Without my information, I don't have any other ideas. Please feel free to follow-up with more information.
