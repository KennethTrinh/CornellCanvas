<p>
 hello
</p>
<p>
 id like to add svgs to my page using the &lt;svg&gt; tag from html. would it be appropriate to abstract all my svg tags and put them in my public/uploads/assets/ folder? and then use
</p>
<p>
 &lt;?php
</p>
<p>
 include('public/uploads/assets/[svgname].php');
</p>
<p>
 ?&gt;
</p>
<p>
 to use them in my pages? or was there another location course staff preferred?
</p>

  One of the learning objectives of this assignment is file uploads. You should store your uploaded SVG files as files in order to meet the learning objectives of the assignment.
