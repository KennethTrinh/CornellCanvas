  Hello,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I would like to redirect my user to the home page when admin logs in where they have restricted access to an insert form. However, when I modify the echo login_form to the home page, the feedback for invalid user/password doesn't appear and instead redirects to the home page even if the input is empty.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Is there a way to edit the sessions.php to support a redirect to home page if login is successful, and else to have the user stay on the login page? After looking at the PHP documentation, it states to use a header() function.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I appreciate any recommendations or tips on how to go about this! Thank you so much!

  This is difficult to answer on Ed. Please visit office hours and also student the
  <code>
   grade-edit.php
  </code>
  example. It uses a similar behavior.

  Please note that this redirect is not required for Project 3. You do not need it for full credit.
