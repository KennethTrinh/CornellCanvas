  If we use key-value coding for our database and our user is adding a new entry (so something that is not specified in the key-value coding), then how do we display it on the page when we apply a filter? Since we are not allowed to hardcode our filter I used a for-each loop and my key-value coding, but this new entry is not specified so how can I display it? Is there a way to add a value to our key value coding array when a user adds an entry to our database?

  Key value coding is not permitted for filtering by tags. You need to use the tag records in the database. I would suggest visiting office hours for help.

  I do use the tag records in the database to filter. I am referring to when I am outputting the name of the actual object which has its own table.
