  I am using my 1300 Project 1 as my static website. I did not conduct any user research for this site, but the project writeup (for 2300) says to create a persona based on user research - should I go conduct user interviews and base a persona off of that? Or should I make a persona based on the audience I outlined in my 1300 Project 1 Design Journey?

  In Project 1 in 1300 you identified the goals/needs of your audience. You may use that for your 2300 projects. I hope this helps!
