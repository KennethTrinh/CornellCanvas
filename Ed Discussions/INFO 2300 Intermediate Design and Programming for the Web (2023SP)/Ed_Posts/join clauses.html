  If our home page information is all in the same table, how might we use join clauses to combine different entries with different tags? I'm confused as to how I might use join clauses because all of my entries are displaying, where the tags are the only different things between entries of the same product name.

  If you're not displaying the tags for each entry on the home page, then you don't need a join. There's nothing else to it. Only use JOIN clauses when they are necessary. There is no requirement to have a JOIN clause on the home page. There is a requirement to have the tag names visible on the details page which does require a JOIN.

  Note: If you're displaying the tags for each entry on the view all page, you will need a separate query for each entry with a join clause.
