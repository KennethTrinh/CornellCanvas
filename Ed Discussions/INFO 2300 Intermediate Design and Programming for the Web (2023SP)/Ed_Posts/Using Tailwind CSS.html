 What does it mean in the rubric when it says: "Students may use external libraries, like Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS." ?
</p>
<p>
 I found a website with tailwind css templates for websites of a similar nature. It looks like this:
</p>

</figure>
<p>
 Can I just for example take this tailwind css template and input my own information? Is that what was meant by us being allowed to use external libraries?
</p>
<p>
 Thank you
</p>

  Tailwind CSS is a CSS library that helps you style your page using common web user interface design patterns. You may import the library and use its reference documentation to style your project 3. I hope that answers your question.
