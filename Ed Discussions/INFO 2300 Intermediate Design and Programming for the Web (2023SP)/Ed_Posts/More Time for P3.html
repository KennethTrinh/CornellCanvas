  Hello!

  In response to the extra in-class Office Hours that you're going to be holding, I was wondering if you would be willing to move the deadline of Milestone 3, so that we can have more time to work on the project and ask questions about M3 content during the extra OH? I feel that the content for this milestone is the hardest compared to everything else we've done so far (for me at least it is), and would appreciate it.

  I understand that this milestone has been challenging and that an extension would be appreciated.

  However, due to the timing of the grading meetings and the time left in the semester, I cannot extend the Milestone 3 deadline and also provide feedback + complete the final submission grading before the end of the semester. I know this isn't the answer that you were hoping for.

  Please remember that milestones don't need to be perfect. All the code should be there, but it may not all work yet, and that's okay. So long as you make a good-faith effort, you will receive full completion credit. If you don't receive full credit, and you made a good, please submit a regrade request.
