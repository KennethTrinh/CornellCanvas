  Is it ok to use the class code for the file upload? Or do we need to write it completely from scratch?

  You aren't expected to write the code from scratch, but you are expected to make the code your own. So please don't just copy the instructor examples and then submit it. I would suggest using the instructor code as a reference, study it, and then try to code it yourself in your code. This is often easier than using someone else's code and debugging it.
