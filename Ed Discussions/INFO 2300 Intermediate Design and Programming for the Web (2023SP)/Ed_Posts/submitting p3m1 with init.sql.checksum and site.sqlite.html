 I want to submit p3m1 but I don't know if I should delete the init.sql.checksum and site.sqlite files that are created when I initialize the database. Is it ok to submit with those files or should I delete and then commit/push?

 <p>
  <code>
   init.sql.checksum
  </code>
  and
  <code>
   site.sqlite
  </code>
  should not be submitted to the repository. There is a
  <code>
   .gitignore
  </code>
  file that prevents them from being submitted so you shouldn't have to worry about it.
