 How can we store tags that are integers from the form (checkboxes) as strings in our database?

  I'm having trouble understanding your question. Would you be able to make my office hours this week? I'm more than happy to help you. But I think I might need to see your code to help you.

   I'm not sure I understand, but are you trying to retrieve the value of a checkbox? Using POST may help in this case

    I used a for-loop to go through each of the checked tags (because often a product has more than one tag).
   </p>
   <p>
    Im struggling to figure out what to put in the array (for INSERT INTO) so that each value for the tag is different based on what was checked off
