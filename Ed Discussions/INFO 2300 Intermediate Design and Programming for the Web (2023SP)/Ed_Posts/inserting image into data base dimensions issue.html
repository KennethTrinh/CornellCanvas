  My form works to insert a new entry and loads at the bottom of the entries page. But it looks really bad when I use sample images because theoretically, the user can input whatever .ext image they want. I had pre-sized each image in my seed data the same square size, and each fits nicely in their respective box. But now, when a new entry is submitted, I can't control its dimensions. Is there a property that I'm missing that can access this, or how should I go about ensuring that the inserted image styles accordingly?

  This is typically handled two ways:

  1. Server-side image scaling and cropping using a background job. This is an advanced topic that we won't cover in this class.

  2. CSS to resize and crop/frame images. Please check out the reference documentation for this. There are many ways to do this. A quick web search comes up with this, which has many viable solutions: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15167545/how-to-crop-a-rectangular-image-into-a-square-with-css
