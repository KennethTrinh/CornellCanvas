  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I want to be able to publish my websites that we've made thus far on GitHub so that I can include them in my portfolio and people can actually visit the websites. I noticed that I can't access the settings of projects 1 and 2. Is there a way for me to be able to publish them to the public?

  GitHub does not support server-side rendered websites, like the ones we are creating in this class. It's not possible to publish your projects this semester to GitHub.

  Is there any other method you recommend in order to publish them in any way?
