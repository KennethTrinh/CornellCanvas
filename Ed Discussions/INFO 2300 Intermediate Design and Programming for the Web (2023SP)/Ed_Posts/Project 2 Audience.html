 Hello, because the project requirements state the user should be able to add records to the catalog, does this mean that the audience should be an 'admin' to the site rather than a typical user (e.g. a customer of a retail site)? Thank you so much!

  You're correct that for a consumer website, there will be two audiences. For the project, we only have one.
 </p>
 <p>
  You might want to think about places on consumer websites where the customer views the entries and also adds them. The first thing that comes to mind is reviews. A customer can read all reviews, but also add their own.

  If reviews don't work for your project, then you're probably dealing with an admin-type audience, which is also fine.
