  I understand that we are supposed to cite all resources that we did not create ourselves.  I am wondering if this applies to a logo supplied to us by a client.  It seems a bit strange to provide a visible citation right next to the client's logo on the nav bar.

  Yes, this is a class project, you must indicate what's your work and what's not your work. This is an issue of academic integrity. I know this seems unreasonable, but we have to know what you created and didn't create when grading. Please cite everything according to the course policy, including your client's logo.
