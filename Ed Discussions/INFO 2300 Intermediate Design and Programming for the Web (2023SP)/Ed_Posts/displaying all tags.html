 In the home page, I succeed in displaying tags for a specific object by having a query inside the for each loop.
</p>
<p>
 Can I do that in this way? If not, what is a good way to do that? (I know tags are not required in home page, just want to try having them).
</p>

  I'm having a hard time understanding your question without seeing your design. From your post, I'm assuming that on the "view all" page you have "thumbnails" for each entry and each entry's tags are listed next to the thumbnail. If this is the case, then yes, you do need a query inside for the for each loop and this is an excellent way to accomplish it!

   I was attempting to do this as well and had a hard time finding other options to execute this. I was wondering if this would constitute as excess queries and would we lose points for this?

    If you are listed each entry's tags in its "thumbnail" then you need a separate query for each thumbnail. It would not be excessive, because it's required to implement it!
