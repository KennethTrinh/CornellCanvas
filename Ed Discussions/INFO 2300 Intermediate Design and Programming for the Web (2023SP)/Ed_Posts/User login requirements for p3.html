 Do we need to implement a login requirement for ALL users of the website (consumers and admins)? I wanted to have my website support logins ONLY for admins, so consumers do not need to log in to see the site - is that okay?

  That is perfectly acceptable for this project! You do not need to support logins for all users, only those who have access controls for privileged actions.
