 For p1, I am using the Applefest site we created in INFO 1300. As is, my site has two types of audiences: the vendor and the visitor.

 If my persona for milestone 2 is a
 <i>
  vendor
 </i>
 , can I still justify the content on the site that would be useful to a visitor? Or do I have to filter out any content that is not relevant to my persona?

  Please note that Project 2 in 2300 (Applefest) should have had 1 audience.

  I would suggest focusing only on one audience for this project. It is a design decision that you'll need to make whether you'll cut material that's not related to your audience's goals.
