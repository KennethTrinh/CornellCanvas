 For my Project 3, I was thinking of doing a second-hand shopping website. The project requirements state that the consumer should be prevented from inserting entries into the database. I was hoping to add an option for consumers to "heart" an item -- is this allowed?

  Yes, "heart"ing an item is not inserting an "entry" into the database, so this should be fine.
