  I was about to submit my project (everything was working when I committed), and when I reopened the window with the commit to double check everything in the submission form, I got an HTTP 500 "localhost is currently unable to handle this request" error after I pressed the submit button to add data to my catalogue. I have no idea what happened; I didn't change anything and it was working perfectly when I committed.

  Does anyone know what this error might be and how I can fix it?
