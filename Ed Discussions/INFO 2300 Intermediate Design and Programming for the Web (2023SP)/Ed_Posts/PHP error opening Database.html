 "Undefined function 'open_sqlite_db'.intelephense(1010)"
</p>
<p>
 The above error is appearing when I use the open db function in my website. Suggestions for alternative solutions to the open-sqlite_db function?
</p>
<p>
 What could be the root of this issue? I was advised to download new packages but my console seems to be updated.

   Have you included the 'db.php' file into your 'router.php' file?
