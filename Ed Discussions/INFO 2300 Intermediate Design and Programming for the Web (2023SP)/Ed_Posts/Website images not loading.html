  For some reason, some of my images are not being loaded after porting my website. When I reload the site, some images that showed up before no longer show up. It's randomized every time I reload. At times, it's not just the images but the text as well. Everything was working fine before when they were static. What could be the issue?

  Please remember that most web servers are case sensitive. This includes your container web server. dog.jpg and dog.JPG and Dog.jpg are all different files on a web server even though on your mac or windows computer they are all the same file. Make sure your URLs match your file names exactly.

  I don’t think the issues is with the URLs because the images do load at times. When I refresh, sometimes the images show up and sometimes they don’t. When I say don’t load I mean that. it’s like there isn’t an image there at all, not even a placeholder.
