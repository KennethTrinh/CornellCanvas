  Would we lose points for making multiple SQL queries to select different groups of tags for one page? For example, I have tags about courses and tags about locations and am saving each group of tags into their own variables selected from two separate queries. Is it ok to select two groups of tags from the same table or is it "inefficient"?

  No, it sounds like you would need a query for each group. So that sounds reasonable to me. I don't see how else you would reasonably implement it.
