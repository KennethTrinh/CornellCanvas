 Is it possible to insert multiple values into the field in the INSERT statement to show up in the database, for example when the form type is a checkbox and multiple values are selected?
</p>
<p>
 More specifically, if there are two options to check: 1 and 2 and both are checked how can both be echoed into the database to look like: "1, 2"
</p>
<p>
 If so, how would we go about doing this? Would this be a type of string concatenation? I am having difficulty finding an example of this in the class activity repos and labs.

  It's not possible to insert multiple values into a "cell".
 </p>
 <p>
  Remember that each field should be about one thing. If you have two checkboxes, then that suggests that you have two fields, not one.
