  Under "Implementing the details page" in the second milestone, it says
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <break>
  </break>
  "Your user’s show now be able to click on a “thumbnail” and it takes them to the one details page that is now customized using query string parameters to display one specific entry."
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  Would it be alright for users to be able to hover over the thumbnail where a dropdown lowers to show some details and a link to click on that leads to the details page? or is the click on the thumbnail and go directly to details page a strict requirement?

  Hovering doesn't usually work on mobile devices well. The details page is required to be a separate page to demonstrate the design patterns, query string, foreign key, and JOIN learning objectives.

  ive went ahead and changed it so clicking on the thumbnail directs you to the details page. would it be recommended that i avoid the hover menu completely? or would it be allowed to add an additional hover menu to this that displays a snippet of what is to be displayed on the details page?
