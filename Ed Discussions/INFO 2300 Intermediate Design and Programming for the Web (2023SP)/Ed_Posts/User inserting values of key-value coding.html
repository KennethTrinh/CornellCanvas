  I feel this was not touched upon. For the requirement,
 </paragraph>
 <list style="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    Include at least one field that uses
    <bold>
     key value coding
    </bold>
    .
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
 </list>
 <paragraph>
  When the user attempts to input this field, and subsequently, insert into the database. Should the user input the key used? or the value?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If the user inputs the value, they could potentially input things not represented by the key and as such, the key won't be utilized and the value will not show. If they input the key, then the value can come accordingly so should they expected to input the key?

  This was touched upon in class and in the labs. Please review the notes and see the example code provided in lecture and labs.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The form should present the
  <italic>
   values
  </italic>
  to the user, but should insert the
  <italic>
   keys
  </italic>
  in the database. See the flower shop example. The user is present with "roses," "daisies," or "gardenias." However, 1, 2, or 3 is inserted into the database.

  what if we are doing key-value input with text?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  similar to how “1092 =&gt; CS1110” in the grades example,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  That case uses client side validation so we can’t present it in the same way
