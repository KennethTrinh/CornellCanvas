  For the Site Design part in the design journal, can the list catalog and table catalog be counted as two different designs? Or it should be different iterations in, for example, the list catalog.

  There is no requirement in Project 2 that you must have design iterations. The design journey simply asks you to sketch your design (singular). You may include additional iterations, like the list or table, if you like, but it's not required.
