 My milestone 2 for project 2 had all of the boxes checked and no comments, but I used a "hidden" class in my css to show form feedback. After reading ed discussion I am confused if this is wrong just because I did not receive feedback about it on my milestone. Are we not supposed to use any hidden classes to show form feedback and if not what should we do instead?

  From the Project 2 requirements:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <b>
   show
  </b>
  the corrective feedback for each invalid piece of data using
  <b>
   conditional output
  </b>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  You may not use the "hidden" class method for Project 2. You should use the conditional output method instead. This is a learning objective of the assignment. Please see the class notes from 3/8.
