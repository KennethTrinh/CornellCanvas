  Do we have to include sketches for BOTH mobile (narrow) and laptop (wide) screens or can we showcase only the laptop screen.

  I'm still unsure. I am using my INFO 1300 project 3 so do i showcase only the wide screens and disregard the narrow screens?

  Just wide screens is necessary. If you choose to implement the project for mobile as well as laptop, then feel free to include those sketches. However, implementation for other devices or responsiveness isn't required.

  In 2300's Project 1, you pick whether you want a mobile, desktop, or both site. It's completely your choice.
