  Should our website have the functionality to group by multiple types of tags? For example, using the material from class, filtering all seeds that are X fruit and Y color? Or do we only need the functionality to filter by each specific type of tag (like A color, B color, C color). Thank you!

  No grouping of tags is required. In fact, I recommend against it. It is unnecessary for full credit, and it adds additional time and testing for a time intensive project. You can just have the tags (even if they are different "groups") in any order, for example:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  #red
  <break>
  </break>
  #tomato
  <break>
  </break>
  #yellow
  <break>
  </break>
  #cucumber
  <break>
  </break>
  #purple
  <break>
  </break>
  #melon
 </paragraph>

  ^ these tags aren't grouped and this 100% meets the project requirements.
