 In the announcement, it says not to hard code or concatenate in SQL queries.
</p>
<p>
 I saved the tag id as a variable (using $_GET) rather than in an array as shown in the example and then set the where clause to equal 'WHERE tags.id = ' . tag_id_variable. Would this be acceptable, or would I need to do it the same way as stated in the example? My P3M3 feedback file indicated that everything I did was correct, but it seems like I am using concatenation to create the where clause.

  No, this is not acceptable because it is unsecure. Please review the class notes for "SQL Security in PHP"
 </p>
 <p>
  Never trust data from
  <code>
   $_GET
  </code>
  . If you take something from
  <code>
   $_GET
  </code>
  and concatenate it into an SQL query, you are opening your website up to SQL injection. This is really bad. You must use parameters markers for your
  <code>
   $tag_id_variable
  </code>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  The only place where concatenation is acceptable for SQL is concatenating SQL clauses. Most everything else is likely to be insecure.
