  I am in Rhodes 590 for the 11AM-12PM office hours, but no one is here. Were the office hours changed? The office hours calendar says there is supposed to be one right now.

  I'm sorry that you went to office hours and no one was there. We're looking into what happened, so we can update the calendar accordingly.

  Please also be advised that today at 11am I also held office hours in Gates 224.
