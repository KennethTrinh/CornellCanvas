  On my website, I placed the delete entry option in the details page. I checked my SQL query in DB Browser, and it functions as it is supposed to. When I click the delete entry button, it deletes the details from the details page that I am currently on; however, when I go back to the homepage to view all of the entries, the entry that I had just deleted is still present. I'm not sure why this is the case, as all other signs would indicate that the entry had been successfully deleted.
