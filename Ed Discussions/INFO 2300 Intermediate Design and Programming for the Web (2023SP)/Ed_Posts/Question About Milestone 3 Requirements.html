 Hi! I was wondering if we need to complete the "
 <b>
  Refined Missing Resource Page (Milestone 3)"
 </b>
 section in the design journey for milestone 3; I know it says milestone 3, but it's placed in the final submission portion of the journey, so I wasn't sure if it was supposed to read "(Final Submission)". Thanks!
</p>

  This is a mistake. You should read "Final Submission" and not "Milestone 3"

  Good catch!
