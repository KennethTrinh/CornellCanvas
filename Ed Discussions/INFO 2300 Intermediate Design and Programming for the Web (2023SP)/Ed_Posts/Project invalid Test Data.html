 For invalid test data in form's test data, should we just do
</p>
<p>
 form data name ie. name :""
</p>
<p>
 since we are testing if the field is empty?
</p>

  Good question. What you have proposed works just fine. Or you can also just write something like
  <code>
   EMPTY
  </code>
  too. It doesn't really matter so long as you communicate that leaving it blank is invalid.
