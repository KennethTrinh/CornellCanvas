  Can I use a dropdown menu for my validation form, or should I just stick to using radio buttons with &lt;input&gt;? Is there any restrictions to our validation form?

  I'm confused about your question. Drop-down menus are used in things like nav bars. They typically require JavaScript to make them work. Please note that JavaScript isn't permitted in Project 2 because the learning objectives are all about server-side rendering in this class.

  However, I think your question may be referring to HTML's
  <code>
   <link href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Other_form_controls#select_box"/>
   &lt;select&gt;
  </code>
  <link href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Other_form_controls#select_box"/>
  box. If you use a select box, and that data is required, you will still need to validate it by checking whether the select box data is empty or not.

  Yes, I meant using the &lt;select&gt; box, thank you.
