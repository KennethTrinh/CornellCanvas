 Traditionally Spring Symposium gathers hundreds of undergraduate students from a diverse array of disciplines to present their research. Student presenters have the opportunity to gain valuable feedback on their work, practice their science communication skills, and make an impact on other undergraduates who may be wondering whether they should join Cornellâ€™s research community.
 <b>
  We are currently looking for interested students to sign up and present their research!
