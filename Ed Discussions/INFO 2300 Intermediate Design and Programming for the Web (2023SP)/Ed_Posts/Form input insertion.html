  I understand that we do not have to validate the form inputs for this assignment. Do we need to program some sort of validation for SQL inputs. For example, one of my fields has a unique constraint so if you try to insert a new entry with the same text there is an SQL error that shuts down the page. I am also using a text input for the tags and have a similar concern. I dont know if I should just assume that the admin/user correctly uses the form

  No. You are not required to validate data for uniqueness. We will not try and instead duplicate data when grading. We are evaluating validation learning objectives for this assignment.
