 I have indicated in my design journey that I would like my refined design to be a mobile layout, but my original website has two other breakpoints as well.  Would I need to delete the relevant styling and html code that accommodates to those two other breakpoints (to leave only the mobile layout) or am I able to leave it as is?

  For Project 1, we will only grade the "resolution" (i.e. wide or narrow) that you specific in the last section in the design journey. This means you only need to support the resolution you specify in the design in your code. I hope this answers your question.
