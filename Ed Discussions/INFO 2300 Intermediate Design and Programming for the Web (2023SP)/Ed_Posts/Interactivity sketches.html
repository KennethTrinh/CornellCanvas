  Are we expected to do interactivity sketches if we want to add a carousel for example? Thank you.

  No, interactivity is not a requirement for this assignment. We do not expect to see the annotated sketches we used in 1300 to plan interactivity. However, they are considered good practice, so please consider doing it to help yourself implement it.
