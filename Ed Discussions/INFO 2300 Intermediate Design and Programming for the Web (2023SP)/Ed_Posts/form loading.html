 hi! When I click submit on my form to insert a new entry, sometimes it works on the first click and sometimes it takes 2 clicks or more. It uploads onto the entires page but sometimes it just takes an extra click to load. Therefore sometimes after I click submit, it will have the loading circle for 10+ minutes. I went to office hours but the TA's weren't able to figure out the error. I am not sure how to fix this

  With the information provided here, I'm not sure what could be causing the issue. May I suggest a few things to help you resolve this issue?
 </p>
 <list style="number">

    Try your code on the virtual engineering computer labs. See the lab 1 instructions. If it works, that suggests that something isn't working correctly on your computer. I would finish your project on the virtual engineering labs rather than try and fix your computer.

    If office hours aren't busy, a TA may be able to clone your repository and see if they have the same two click issue on their computer. If they don't, that suggests something is wrong with your computer.

    If you have JavaScript, turn it off, comment it out, or get rid of it.

    Try and visit my office hours next week.

  I hope this helps. I know it must be frustrating to have this unpredictable behavior and spending time in office hours without a resolution.
