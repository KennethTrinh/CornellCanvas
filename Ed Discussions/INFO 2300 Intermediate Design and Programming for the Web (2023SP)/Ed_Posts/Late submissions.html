  It says on the Canvas announcement that all late submissions are allowed until the 9th with noted penalty on the syllabus. When we submit the late labs, do we have to email the 2300 email letting you guys know that we are submitting it late, or do we just do the submission form like we do normally with the submissions? Also, are late submissions allowed for missed Pre-class exercises?

  The front page of the submission form has more information about this. You can also check it for more information.

  Short answer is that you need to tell us you submitted something late so that we know to grade it. So yes, for late labs, email info2300@cornell.edu telling us to grade the late work.

  If you don't tell us, we simply don't know, and we won't grade the late work because we already graded assignment X and didn't know that more came in to grade. I know it's annoying to have to tell us, but we really appreciate it. It also ensures that your work is graded in a timely manner.
