  I'm struggling to insert checkbox tags from the form into the database. The name and value components of the &lt;input&gt; for each tag are set through a foreach loop and php echo, so I'm confused on how to call the specific ids for multiple tags. I've been able to get the record id (for the newly added product) but can't seem to make it work for inserting the tags.

  This is very hard to answer in Ed. I kindly request that you please visit office hours (mine are today at 11) so that we can look at your code and try and figure out what might be the problem.

  What I think may help here to sketch out your form and next to each input, label which table it goes in. Then try and plan a query for how to insert that input's data in the database. It really helps to think through what you need for the queries to make this work. I hope this helps. Please feel free to visit my office hours. I am more than happy to help you.
