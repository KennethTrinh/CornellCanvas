  Do we have to use check boxes when adding tags to the new entry? Or are we able to use radio buttons?

  Radio buttons are mutually exclusive. That means you can only pick one option. The Project 3 requirements state that a new entry should be able to be tagged with every available tag, which would suggest checkboxes, but checkboxes are not required (there are other solutions).
