  Would a catalog with various music albums and ratings be acceptable for project 3? And there will be an option to log in and comment/like on different albums, but you don't have to log in and can just view other people's reviews.

  This is a pretty complicated project. I would advise you scale this project down.

  Before I can answer your other questions, I need to know what's your plan for the "tags" requirement. Is your plan to implement tags or to use the albums as "tags" and the comments as "entries"?

  Please feel free to stop my office hours to discuss if that's helpful too.
