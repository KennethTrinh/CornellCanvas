 My TA said it was bad practice, but will it cost me points?

  Hi! I am not sure if I understand your question - I don't think it's a bad practice, because you should have an "id" field for your table. However, if you mean whether you should include "id" field when writing the insert queries, you will not lose points as long as your queries are valid. However, it's a good practice to just omit the "id" field since it's auto-increment, because manually adding "id" values may cause errors.
