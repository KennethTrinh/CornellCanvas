 do slips days count towards dropping pre-class preparations and class participations?

  Slip days may only be used on assignments. Assignments are lab homeworks or the projects.
 </p>
 <p>
  They can't be applied to pre-class preparation (because you need to be prepared for class and slip days would prevent that) or in-class participation (because you need to participate when you're in class.)

   I see that the syllabus says "Your lowest 4 participation grades will be dropped at the end of the semester." I understand that this counts towards in-class participations, but does this also count towards pre-class prepartions? Thank you.

    No, the lowest 4 participation grades only impact participation, not pre-class preparation.
