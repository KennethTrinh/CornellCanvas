 Hello! The project description says to "show the corrective feedback for each invalid piece of data using conditional output". Does this mean that, unlike we did in labs and in class, we must use a string variable for the feedback (initially set to ' '). Then, we can alter the variable to the feedback message if the field is invalid? Thank you.

  It means not to set a variable to the empty string('') or 'hidden' and echo that out as a class. But rather use conditional statements in PHP to conditionally output some HTML. This was covered in Class 3/8.
 </p>
 <p>
  For example:
 </p>
 <pre>&lt;?php if (TODO_some_expression) { ?&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;this HTML will only output if TODO_some_expression evaluates to true.&lt;/p&gt;
  
&lt;?php } ?&gt;
</pre>
