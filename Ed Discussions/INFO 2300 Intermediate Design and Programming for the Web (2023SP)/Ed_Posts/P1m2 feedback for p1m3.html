 If I haven’t received my p1m2 feedback (due to a COVID extension) can I leave the section in milestone 3 about revisions blank?

  I want you to know that I understand that it's difficult to complete this part of the assignment without your feedback.
 </p>
 <p>
  I want you to know that the completion grade for milestones will not include grading the feedback sections in the design journey because we've got a bit of grading to catch up on. We're trying to get through it as quickly as possible. I'm sorry that it's taking so long, and we'll try to have it out shortly.

   Hi,

   We'll release the p1m2 feedback soon once it's ready.
  </p>

   Hope this helps!
