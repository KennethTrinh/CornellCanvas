  Is it acceptable to use key-value pairing with one of our text field inputs?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  In other words, the user would have to input text like "1" to insert "apple" to the database
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Asking because this is unlike one of the class examples which just used key-value pairing with labeled radio buttons, and having the user enter a number like this doesn't really make sense in context

  I don't really understand the question, but I don't think it's usable to ask the user to input a number when they are thinking "apple." So I think you may need to revise your design.
