 At the end of class today you showed an example of a seeds table, tags table, and seed_tags table. Is it possible to show how you would code the join and select clauses for this example?

  Unfortunately, I feel that providing this query is essentially providing a solution for the project. It's really important to me that everyone in this class learn this material, and I want to make sure that I don't take away anyone's learning opportunity.

  I would suggest the following, take a look at the JOIN clause class notes from class 3/22. See the example JOIN query for products and review. Using the example from class today with seeds, determine which table: seeds, tags, or seed-tags is "products" and which one "reviews". Then try and practice planning out the JOIN clause for the seeds example. If you need help, we're always happy to help during office hours.

  I hope this helps. I'm trying to provide as much information as I can without giving the answers away. I hope you understand. My intention is to help you learn. I don't want anyone to leave this class without understanding how join information from two tables.
