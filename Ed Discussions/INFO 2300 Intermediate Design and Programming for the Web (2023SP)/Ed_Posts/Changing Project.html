 I completed the first milestone using my Project 1 from INFO 1300, but I have changed my mind and would like to use my Project 2 instead. Is it ok to change the existing site that I use for my project?

  Because nothing for Project 1 will be graded for correctness until the final submission, you are always free to change the project as you see fit, including changing the static website you port to dynamic.
