 I've tried troubleshooting docker installation issues on my own, gone to office hours, used a different PC (windows &amp; Mac), and have tried using the remote lab computers. On the remote lab computers and my personal windows PC, I get the error "docker daemon not running" and have had no success with troubleshooting. I'm genuinely unsure of what next steps I should take to try and resolve this issue. Any help would be greatly appreciated

  If you are unable to get Docker working on your computer, you will need to use the in-person Engineering labs or the virtual Engineering labs. I would suggest using the virtual labs, as you'll be able to access them from your laptop.

   For the error "Docker daemon not running" could you make sure that Docker Desktop is open and try running docker commands again?

     I meant any docker commands to verify that it is installed correctly. When you follow the instructions for installing Docker on their website (
     <a href="https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/">
      https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/
     </a>
     ), you can verify the installation on the command line by trying something like
     <code>
      docker --version
     </code>
     .

      I can run the version command but nothing else. For example, "docker run hello-world" doesn't work

       When you run
       <code>
        docker run hello-world
       </code>
       , what's the command line output?
      </p>
      <p>
       For me, I see
      </p>
      <pre>$ docker run hello-world

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:
 https://hub.docker.com/

For more examples and ideas, visit:
 https://docs.docker.com/get-started/

</pre>
      <p>
       If you see something like "Is the docker daemon runnning?" then you should check if Docker is open
