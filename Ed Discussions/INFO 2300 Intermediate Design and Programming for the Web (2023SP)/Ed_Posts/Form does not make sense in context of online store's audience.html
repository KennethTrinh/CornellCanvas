 Hello. I was looking at my p1 feedback and I am slightly confused about the form. My site is essentially an online marketplace that lists different oysters that customers can buy. The database I have is a list of oysters with relevant information that would inform a customer's decision making process. A form would not make sense on this website for the same target audience (why would a customer input information into a database that contains the very information they are looking for to buy in the first place). I have tweaked my original idea so that oyster farmers can submit their oyster information for the customers (commercial non-farmer audience), however this inherently would create two different target audiences (one that is looking for oysters, and one who is trying to sell them).
</p>
<p>
 What should I do? Do I need to restructure the audience such that is a group is one that is looking to buy and sell oysters (not a realistic group so I don't know why I would do this).
</p>

  There is only one audience for Project 2. You will need to design your catalog for an audience that would submit the form and would view the catalog. There are several example posts of questions like yours on Ed if that's helpful.
