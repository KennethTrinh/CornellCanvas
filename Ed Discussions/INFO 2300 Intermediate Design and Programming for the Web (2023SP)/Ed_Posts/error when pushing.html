  I am trying to push my milestone 3 to github but I am getting this error message. I tried the suggestion from another thread and it isn't working for me. How do you push despite the error?

  When I have this issue, sometimes it's helpful for me to push my work through the terminal. #36

  It might help to restart VSCode as well if you have't already! And also maybe try to run the command
  <code>
   ssh -T git@github.coecis.cornell.edu
  </code>
  to check if your ssh is in fact configured correctly!

  Allison's right. If this command works, then your keys are correct, but your SSH Agent isn't. You may need to redo the "Configure SSH Agent" instructions from Lab 1.
