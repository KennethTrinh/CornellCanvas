  Part of my milestone 1 feedback was that none of my images were loading, and after replicating the issue I ended up optimizing all of my images and readjusting their dimensions. However, it turns out the issue was a network error that occurs on several random images on each page reload (making a placeholder appear in-browser:

  <image height="106" src="https://static.us.edusercontent.com/files/ezFZJcCke0e4tD705OK2ky0T" width="189"/>

 <paragraph>
  On chrome the error is "net:ERR_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH (OK)"

  On firefox the error is "image corrupt or truncated"

  Some other notes form my troubleshooting:

 <list style="bullet">

   <paragraph>
    There's no corruption on the images when I preview them directly as HTML files
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    A page reload will sometimes raise no errors, and the failed images are always random
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    The error never seems to occur on my home page, which has only one image
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
 </list>
 <paragraph>
  Is it possible this is some memory issue related to my docker container? Or are all of my images actually corrupted and need to be recreated?
