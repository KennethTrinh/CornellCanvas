 Part of my milestone 1 feedback was that none of my images were loading, and after replicating the issue I ended up optimizing all of my images and readjusting their dimensions. However, it turns out the issue was a network error that occurs on several random images on each page reload (making a placeholder appear in-browser:
</p>
<figure>
 <image height="106" src="https://static.us.edusercontent.com/files/ezFZJcCke0e4tD705OK2ky0T" width="189"/>
</figure>
<p>
 On chrome the error is "net:ERR_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH (OK)"
</p>
<figure>
 <image height="30.475967957276367" src="https://static.us.edusercontent.com/files/BmkZHWgyyhYcp549GQwhAdJN" width="643"/>
</figure>
<p>
 On firefox the error is "image corrupt or truncated"
</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>
 Some other notes form my troubleshooting:
</p>
<list style="bullet">
 <li>
  <p>
   There's no corruption on the images when I preview them directly as HTML files
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   A page reload will sometimes raise no errors, and the failed images are always random
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   The error never seems to occur on my home page, which has only one image
  </p>
 </li>
</list>
<p>
 Is it possible this is some memory issue related to my docker container? Or are all of my images actually corrupted and need to be recreated?
