  I do not have an existing website, so I will have to create one. I was wondering, would it be possible to get access to a blank INFO 1300 Project 1 so that I can try and follow the conventions used by most students in the class? I think moving forward it would be easier to get help if I follow the natural sequence.

  Also, when creating a new website, will I have to conduct user interviews/testing in order for it to be elgiible for this project?

  To meet the pre-req for this class, you should have created a static website at some point. If you don't have a static website, then it's likely that you haven't submitted a waiver for the pre-req. Please note that students without the pre-req will be dropped from this class by the end of the add period if they don't have a 1300 waiver.

  1300 students start with a blank repository. So there is no example "blank INFO 1300 Project 1" to provide you with. You should see the best practices section in the 2300 Project 1 requirements for most of the conventions.

  Your website should be created using the user-centered design process. This means conducting interviews, etc. You should have done this to meet the pre-req of 2300.
