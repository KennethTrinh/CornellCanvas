 Is it alright that our id's in the database have gaps (ie. 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, ) because of manual record deletion, and if not, how do we address this?

  This is normal. It's totally fine to have gaps. It's to be expected.

  All the databases of your favorite websites don't have sequential IDs either.
