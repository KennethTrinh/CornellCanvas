 I went to office hours for mile stone where I was told I could use a button to get to the details page. On my milestone 2 I was told to use http build query which means I basically have to redo the entire milestone 2 part. I am still using http build query for the tags but can I use the button for the details page?

  I'm sorry that you were told to use a button. While I do not know the details of what has happened here, I do know that the project requirement discourage a button for things that would not have a button in other catalogs (i.e. design patterns). You should not have been told something that contradicts the assignment's requirements.

  From the Project 3 requirements:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <i>
   A common mistake on this project is to have “submit” buttons everywhere on your site.
  </i>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Not many catalogs have a button to go to the details page. They often have buttons for "Add to Cart," but not "Go to Details." A hyperlink is used with query string parameters instead.
 </p>
 <p>
  You should probably use query string parameters. I know this is frustrating. However, the good news is that updating the HTML code for the view all page, is only a small portion of the milestone 2 requirements and doesn't require redoing the entire milestone. I am happy to help you in my office hours to make this update. Please feel free to come and see me if this answer isn't satisfactory. I'm more than happy to help you and make changes where necessary.
