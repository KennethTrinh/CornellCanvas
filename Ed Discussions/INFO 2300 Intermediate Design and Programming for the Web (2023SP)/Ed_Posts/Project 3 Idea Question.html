  Is this a good topic for a catalog? It is a catalog with a set number of movies, where the Administrator audience doesn't add new entries, but instead adds new reviews to each of the movies. Is this an okay model or should the Administrator audience be able to add a new movie entry?

  We should chat about this. But it sounds like your "entries" are reviews and movies are "tags"? Is that correct. This would likely work for the project requirements, but we should probably chat about it. Please remember that each review would need at least 2 "tags" and I think that may be hard to do in this case.
