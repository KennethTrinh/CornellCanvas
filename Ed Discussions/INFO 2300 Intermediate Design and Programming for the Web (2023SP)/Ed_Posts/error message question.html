 I'm having this error message when I open the inspector sometimes, but when I refresh the page, it just always goes away.
</p>
<p>
 I wonder what does this mean and does it matters when I sometimes have it and sometimes not?

  It is hard to debug this without looking at office hours. However, since these errors appear for javascript code, which is not a requirement for project 1, I am inclined to say it doesn't matter for project 1 as long as the site is usable.
