 In Firefox, WAVE audit says I have 8 very low contrast errors. However, highlighting over the error icons does not show me where the low contrast areas are on my page. In Chrome, WAVE says I have 0 contrast errors. How do I find the low contrast areas on WAVE? Does it matter that Firefox and Chrome differ?

  This sounds like you may have other addons in FireFox that are impacting the WAVE audit. I might try using FireFox in the virtual Engineering labs (See Lab Homework 1). Otherwise, if it passes in Chrome, you have passed the WAVE audit and have met the project's requirements.
