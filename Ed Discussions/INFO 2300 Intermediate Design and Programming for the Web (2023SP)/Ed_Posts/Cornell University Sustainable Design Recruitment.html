 Cornell University Sustainable Design, Cornellâ€™s largest sustainability organization. The organization is composed of 14 project teams with 14+ members from all 7 colleges.  They are currently recruiting for one of their teams, Ithaca Carbon Neutral (ICN) Modeling. The team aims to tackle Ithaca's 2030 goal of making the city carbon neutral. ICN Modeling collaborates with ICN Policy, another CUSD subteam, and groups like the local government and different companies and stakeholders, to improve the overall sustainability and equity of Ithaca and beyond.

<p>
 Working towards this main goal, the subteam takes on different portfolios/projects, side by side with ICN Policy, to tackle different energy intensive sectors like the building and transportation ones. To focus on each different area, the ICN Modeling team is further divided into four more specific sub teams, which are: Electrification, Renewables, Waste Management, and Transportation. While each section works on its own project, we all help each other reach the common goal of making Ithaca carbon neutral by 2030!

  Also, consider joining the Currents sub team on CUSD!  We are creating an app to optimize Cornell's HVAC systems in single-occupancy rooms, which is pretty cool.
