 Hi is there anyone coming to the 11am zoom OH? The TA entered, didn't say anything, and left after a couple minutes. Are there technical difficulties?

  Hi. There was a technical difficulty with the zoom app. I attempted several times and joined the meeting 8 mins past 11 AM through the web browser.
 </p>
 <p>
  I explained to everyone who was waiting and attempted to join my OH. And I held OH for 10 mins longer.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks for your patience.
 </p>

  I am sorry that this has happened to you.

  Please send issues with office hours to info2300@cornell.edu

  I am doing my best to address TAs not showing up to office hours.
