  Hi is there anyone coming to the 11am zoom OH? The TA entered, didn't say anything, and left after a couple minutes. Are there technical difficulties?

  Hi. There was a technical difficulty with the zoom app. I attempted several times and joined the meeting 8 mins past 11 AM through the web browser.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I explained to everyone who was waiting and attempted to join my OH. And I held OH for 10 mins longer.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thanks for your patience.
