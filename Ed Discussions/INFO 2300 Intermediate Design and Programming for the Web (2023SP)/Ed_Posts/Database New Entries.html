  I have been having problems with db browser. Mainly that the updates I make in db browser don't reflect in the sqlite file in VSCODE, unless I delete the file and add it again manually. Additionally, whenever I add a record in the final milestone, it appears in the database in DB Browser, but not when I open the file in VSCode. Is this ok? I met with a TA last week with help on a similar issue and they were not able to help me resolve it.
