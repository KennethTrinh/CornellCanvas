  If we're going to implement a shopping website, other than giving customers means of viewing the products (and their details), is it okay if we don't have full functionality for some features. For example, on the details page, if we have an 'add to cart' button included in our design, does it need to actually work?

  You need not built all the functionality, so long as you met the project's requirements.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The answer depends on how you view the project's requirements. They are designed to be flexible to permit students to implement projects that are personally motivating.

 <paragraph>
  The requirement for tags is simply a one-to-many or many-to-many table relationship requirement.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  That means you can implement convention tags, as we explored in class with the seed activity.

  However, if each user has a cart, then adding items to a cart is
  <italic>
   essentially
  </italic>
  tagging items for a user. This is a bit confusing, and so if you'd rather built a shopping website with conventional tags and leave out the "add to cart" button, that also works!
