  I have learned that we will also have to add citation uploads into the database and in-text citations are not enough? Is this true? If I just use intext citations what are the chances that it escalates into an AI? If it were just a grade penalty how much is it?

  The citation policy asks that each resource be cited on screen near the resource if you didn't create it specifically for this class.

  Unfortunately, I don't understand the vocabulary used in your question, so I'm having trouble to answer it to help you. I'm sorry about that. I'm not sure what "citation uploads" and what you specifically mean by "in-text citations"

  Omitting citations is a grade deduction. It is not related to academic integrity. So there is no concern there. Please follow up if you need more help. I'm doing my best to understand your question and answer it.
