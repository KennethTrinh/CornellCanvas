  Will there be lab due this weekend despite Feb break? If so, can it be released today? I am traveling tomorrow and will not have access to my computer.

  Yes, there is a lab this week. Whenever class is in session, I'm required to hold class, so we'll also have labs tomorrow.

  Tip: You can always check the course schedule to see what's happening in the course, this is linked in Canvas, but I'll put it here too:
