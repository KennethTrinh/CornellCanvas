  How should we implement routing? I've uncommented it in launch.js and inputted the proper routes, but I get the error when I debug:
 </paragraph>
 <pre>localhost is currently unable to handle this request.
HTTP ERROR 500
</pre>
 <paragraph>
  Is this a common issue, and I'm missing something? Planning to go to OH Tues, but an answer sooner would be great if it is a generic question.

  Have you tried to restart debugging? When you modified launch.js, you always need to rerun the code.
