<p>
 I misinterpreted the survey as the answer choices were both in support of eliminating the delete entry requirement:
</p>
<p>
 Yes, I support eliminating the "delete an entry requirement."
</p>
<p>
 No, I support eliminating the "delete an entry requirement."
</p>
<p>
 Is there an option to resubmit the survey?
</p>
<p>
 Thank you!
</p>
