  I misinterpreted the survey as the answer choices were both in support of eliminating the delete entry requirement:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Yes, I support eliminating the "delete an entry requirement."
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  No, I support eliminating the "delete an entry requirement."
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Is there an option to resubmit the survey?

  Thank you!
