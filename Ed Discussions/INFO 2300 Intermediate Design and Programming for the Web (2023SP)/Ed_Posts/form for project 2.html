  It seems a bit not user friendly for the user to have to scroll to the bottom of the page every time they fill out the form wrong. On the other hand, it's also not very user friendly to put the form at the very top and the actual content below. Is there a way to keep the user at the bottom of the page even if they submit an incorrect form? Or is there a way to have a button at the top of the page that shows the form when clicked and hides the form when clicked again? I think the latter requires javascript which is not allowed for this project 2 but are there any other alternatives?

  The most user-friendly way to do this is using client-side validation. But that requires JavaScript and this class is about server-side programming, so we don't want to use that.

  For now, you can use
  <link href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a#linking_to_an_element_on_the_same_page"/>
  URL anchors to jump the user back to the form (I demo'd this before class one day.)
