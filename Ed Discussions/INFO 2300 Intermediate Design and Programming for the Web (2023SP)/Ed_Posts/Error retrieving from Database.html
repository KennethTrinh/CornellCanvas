 keep receiving this error which won't allow me to retrieve any database data- any ideas on fixing this? there aren't errors in the router from what I've seen- I haven't changed the router at all and it matches the router from labs etc.

  I had the same issue, I think, just make sure to include "include_once('includes/db.php');" in your router.php file

   This is the correct answer. Please see the class notes for calling the database. The first step is to load the library by using
   <code>
    include_once('includes/db.php');
   </code>
   .

  Is open_sqlite_db working? If not, it seems you are missing a step that lets you actually use functions in db.php. Try checking back to notes on using a database in PHP to see what you may have missed. If this is not the problem, then please visit OH.
