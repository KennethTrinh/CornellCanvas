  Will lab 10 not be penalized for being submitted on the Monday after break? It says that it is due tomorrow, but you only start using up slip days starting Tuesday after break?

  This is correct.

 <paragraph>
  The deadline is today, Friday 3/31. If you submit on Tuesday 4/11 you will consume 1 slip day. Even though no work is required nor necessitated during break or the day after break, if you choose to work over break and submit Lab 10 on Monday 4/10, it will not consume a slip day. However, this is completely optional and up to you whether you decided to work during break or the day after break. The lab is designed to be completed during your lab section in 50 minutes. You should be able to complete it before you leave for break.
