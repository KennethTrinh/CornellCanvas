 Hi Professor Harms,
</p>
<p>
 I hope that all is well! My name is Nancy, a junior in the Hotel School and the business lead for Cornell Design &amp; Tech Initiative, a student project team that builds software products for community impact. We will be hosting a resume workshop this week, and we thought that the students in your class, INFO 2300, would be interested in this event. I am wondering if it would be possible to post about this in the announcement for your class, INFO 2300, please? Attached is the information and graphic to be posted in the announcement. Thank you so much and enjoy the rest of your day!
</p>
<p>
 Sincerely,
</p>
<p>
 Nancy
