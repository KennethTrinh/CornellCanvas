 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 Is the calculated course grade on Canvas an accurate representation of our actual standing in the course? Thank you.

  Yes, your grade in Canvas is correct and always up to date.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, please understand that the Project 3 category is currently weighted with only your milestones without the final submission. Which means that each milestone
  <i>
   appears
  </i>
  to influence your final grade more than it should. Once the Project 3 Final grades are released, the milestones won't have such "weight" in your grade as they do now. (Project 3 is worth 32% of your final grade. Note that even though each milestone is only about 2.5% of your final grade, right now because of the way Canvas calculates this, each milestone shows as about 10% of your final grade. This is misleading.)
