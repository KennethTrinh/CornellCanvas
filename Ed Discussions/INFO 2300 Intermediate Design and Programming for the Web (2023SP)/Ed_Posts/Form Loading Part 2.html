 Hello!
</p>
<p>
 I'm running into the same issue as
 <a href="/us/courses/36502/discussion/2982411">
  #365
 </a>
 and I was wondering if there was ever a resolution to this. Thanks!
</p>

  I'm sorry, I'm unable to find 365. What was the question?

   This was the original inquiry:

   hi! When I click submit on my form to insert a new entry, sometimes it works on the first click and sometimes it takes 2 clicks or more. It uploads onto the entires page but sometimes it just takes an extra click to load. Therefore sometimes after I click submit, it will have the loading circle for 10+ minutes. I went to office hours but the TA's weren't able to figure out the error. I am not sure how to fix this

    This student visit office hours, and it was an issue with their computer. Fixing the computer would take longer than using the virtual or physical engineering computer labs (which do not have these issues). The recommended resolution at this time is to use another computer.
