  I am having a great deal of trouble writing a query that grabs multiple tags for a single entry.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For example, if we have entry1, and entry2 where entry1 has tag1 but entry2 has tag2 and tag3.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  How can we make it such that a single record has one entry, and two tags
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  ex:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  {1 =&gt; entry1, tag1
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2 =&gt; entry2, tag2, tag3 }
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  My results duplicate entry2 such that but I am not sure how else to grab both tags.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  {1 =&gt; entry1, tag1
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2 =&gt; entry2, tag2,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  3 =&gt; entry2, tag3 }
 </paragraph>

  Your result is correct and expected behavior. It's not possible to return:
 </paragraph>
 <pre>{1 =&gt; entry1, tag1

2 =&gt; entry2, tag2, tag3 }</pre>

  I will note it sounds like (although I'm not sure from the information provided here) like you simply might need a separate SQL query to get whatever functionality you're working on to work. It seems like you might be trying to do too much with 1 query and that 2 would solve this. But I don't know for sure without looking at your code. I hope this helps.
