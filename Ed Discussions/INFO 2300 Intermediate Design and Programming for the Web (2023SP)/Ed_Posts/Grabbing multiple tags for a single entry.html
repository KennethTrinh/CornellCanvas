 I am having a great deal of trouble writing a query that grabs multiple tags for a single entry.
</p>
<p>
 For example, if we have entry1, and entry2 where entry1 has tag1 but entry2 has tag2 and tag3.
</p>
<p>
 How can we make it such that a single record has one entry, and two tags
</p>
<p>
 ex:
</p>
<p>
 {1 =&gt; entry1, tag1
</p>
<p>
 2 =&gt; entry2, tag2, tag3 }
</p>
<p>
 My results duplicate entry2 such that but I am not sure how else to grab both tags.
</p>
<p>
 {1 =&gt; entry1, tag1
</p>
<p>
 2 =&gt; entry2, tag2,
</p>
<p>
 3 =&gt; entry2, tag3 }
</p>

  Your result is correct and expected behavior. It's not possible to return:
 </p>
 <pre>{1 =&gt; entry1, tag1

2 =&gt; entry2, tag2, tag3 }</pre>
 <p>
  I will note it sounds like (although I'm not sure from the information provided here) like you simply might need a separate SQL query to get whatever functionality you're working on to work. It seems like you might be trying to do too much with 1 query and that 2 would solve this. But I don't know for sure without looking at your code. I hope this helps.
