 I know that we are supposed to copy session.php over into our code. Are we also allowed to copy the CSS for the login?

  I would prefer that you write your own CSS code because you'll want to style your form to match the theme of your website, not the 2300 example site. I would suggest using some of the ideas from the example's CSS, but still write your own so that the forms "fit in" to your website.
