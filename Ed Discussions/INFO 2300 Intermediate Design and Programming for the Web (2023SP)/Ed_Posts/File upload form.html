 Is it necessary that the form for the file upload is a separate form from the "regular" form (that asks for name and email for example), or can it be all one form?

<div style="text-indent: 2em;">

  What do you mean separate? The file upload should be part of the insert entry form. What is name and email in your example?

  Closing this issue for now. I don't have enough information to answer this question.
