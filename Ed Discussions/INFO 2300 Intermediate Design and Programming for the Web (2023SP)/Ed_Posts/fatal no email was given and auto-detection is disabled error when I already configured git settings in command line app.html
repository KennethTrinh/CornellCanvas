 I'm trying to push my lab 1 for submission and I got the error as shown in the post title. This is after typing in my specific credentials on my command line (replacing the sample text with my own credentials):
</p>
<p>
 git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
</p>
<p>
 git config --global user.name "Your Name"
</p>
<p>
 Anyone know any steps I can take to resolve this? Thanks
</p>
