  I'm trying to push my lab 1 for submission and I got the error as shown in the post title. This is after typing in my specific credentials on my command line (replacing the sample text with my own credentials):
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Anyone know any steps I can take to resolve this? Thanks
