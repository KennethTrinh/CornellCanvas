 I was wondering why I keep getting this error message when I try to start the debugging server. Do I have to download PHP and set the path in VS code?
</p>
<p>
 Cannot validate since a PHP installation could not be found. Use the setting 'php.validate.executablePath' to configure the PHP executable.
