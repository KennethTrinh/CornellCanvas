  I'm having trouble creating a persona for my site because it is a personal portfolio site and the goal of my audience is to literally learn more about me.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Even with forms, i'm not sure what information about them i need to collect when their goal is to collect information about me.

  I cannot say. You will need to look at your user research from your user interviews to determine how a form would align with their goals.

  If that doesn't reveal anything, then I would suggest brainstorming with your peers. I'll help you start. Hiring often requires some form of a meeting. I might want to know the person's availability to schedule a meeting. Maybe there's a need for a form to look up the availability on a date, etc. Does this help give you some ideas?

  Note: You will not implement the availability look-up in the database/calendar. For Project 1 you will only code a form and present a confirmation message.
