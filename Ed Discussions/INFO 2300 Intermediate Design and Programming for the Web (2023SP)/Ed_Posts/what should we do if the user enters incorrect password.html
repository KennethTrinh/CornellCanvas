 Everything works if the user enters the correct username and password, but should we have anything for if they accidently put in the wrong password or username? Currently it doesn't give any feedback and just redirects to the home page.

  You don't need to worry about an incorrect user name and password. We are only using valid data when testing project 3. The validation learning objectives were covered in Project 2, so we don't need to see them again in this project. I hope this makes sense.
