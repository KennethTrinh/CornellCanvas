  Hi, I was wondering how milestone grades factor into the final grade for each project. On the syllabus it says that projects are graded for correctness, but milestones are graded on completeness. Will a low milestone grade cause a completely correct project to have a lower grade?

  Your Project 3 grade is p3m1 + p3m2 + p3m3 + p3fin. The milestones are graded for completion and the final submission is graded for correctness. So your complete Project 3 grade is 30 points + 100 points = 130 points total. You can calculate out what you think is a low milestone grade, and how it will affect your overall project grade.
