 For p3m3, one requirement is that the "media file exists for each seed record". What exactly does the media file refer to?

  For most students, this is the seed image for each seed record. Images are not required for this assignment. You could have used, for example, video. So you would need seed video files, which is why I referred to them as "media' files.
