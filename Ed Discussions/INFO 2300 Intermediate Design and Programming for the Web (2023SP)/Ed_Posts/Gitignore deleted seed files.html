 Hi!
</p>
<p>
 I was wondering how grading would work if my images didn't commit to git correctly. My gitignore file didn't commit both my seed images and my designated uploads folder alongside my uploaded images, and I didn't have time to recommit them before my assignment deadline. Would it be better to resubmit for 70% credit (I'm out of slip days) or will this be okay for overall grading?
</p>
<p>
 Thank you!
</p>

  It's hard to say how many points because this type of issue hits across several learning objectives. However, since images are critical for a media catalog, I would strongly encourage you to have working images before submitting your assignment to be graded. That may mean you need to submit for 70% credit. But many of the objectives, including design, touch the need for the media in a media catalog.
