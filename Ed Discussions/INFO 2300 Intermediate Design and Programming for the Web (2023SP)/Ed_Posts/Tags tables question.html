 I'm a little confused on the tags table. Looking at the example given in class it looks like for every tag there is only one table. Im making a catalog website of clothes so say would style and price be on the same table or would there be one table named prices and one table named styles?

  You should only have 3 tables for Project 3:
 </p>
 <list style="bullet">
  <li>
   <p>
    "entries"
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    "tags"
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    "entry_tags"
   </p>
  </li>
 </list>
 <p>
  Since your clothes table, price probably belongs there because price isn't typically a tag. I'm not sure if this answers your question. Please feel free to chat with me about this because I want to make sure I'm giving you correct information for your situation.
