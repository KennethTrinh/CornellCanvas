  What is the best way to JOIN the three tables we have for project 3, if one of the tables "corresponds" the tag to the element id (like with the seed example in lecture)?

  For Project 3, you shouldn't need to JOIN three tables. If you are, then 1) you might be doing more than is required for the project, or 2) your schema may be structured suboptimally. I would suggest visiting office hours for clarity.

  However, if you really need to JOIN three tables, then you simply add two JOIN clauses to the query. That's really all there is to it.
