  Look at the catalog websites you used as inspiration or for analyzing design patterns. Find one that aligns with your Project 3 and study how they implement filtering by a tag. Some websites have a sidebar that you can filter with. Some have little tag elements on the top of the catalog you can click on to just see things of that tag. You can even search for "tag design patterns" or "tag user interface design patterns." There are many ways to implementing filtering by a tag. Please feel free to visit my office hours if you're still unsure.
