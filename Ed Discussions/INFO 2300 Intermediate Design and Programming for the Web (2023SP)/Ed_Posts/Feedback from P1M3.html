  For p1m3, the TA said that my form doesn't include at least 3 types of controls. So far, I included input elements with type="email" and type="text", &lt;textarea&gt;, and a button with type="submit". Does this mean I have to add another type of control?

  This looks like a simple mistake. You have four different controls with four different types. That absolutely meets the Project 1 requirements.
