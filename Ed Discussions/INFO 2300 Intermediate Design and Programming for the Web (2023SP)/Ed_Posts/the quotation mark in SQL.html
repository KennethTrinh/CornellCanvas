  I am confused by the usage of  quotation marks in the SQL sentence. In the init.sql file, the table name, the field names in the SQL sentence are all using double quotation marks. However, in the php file, inside the exec_sql_query(), the table name and the field names inside the SQL sentence are all without quotation marks. What cause this difference? is there a general rule? thanks.

  Would you mind posting a snippet of an example of each? I think the confusion here might be the syntax of different SQL statements, but I'm not sure, and I don't want to give you a wrong answer.

  The answer here is likely due to the syntax of the different types of queries.
