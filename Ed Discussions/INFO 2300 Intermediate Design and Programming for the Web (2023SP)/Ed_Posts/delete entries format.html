 Hi!
</p>
<p>
 I was wondering if there was a required place to delete entries. Can we make a new page specifically to delete?

  This is a design decision. You may pick any location that you feel works for your administrator audience. However, common design patterns often include it on the details page for administrative users. or a delete option in a table view (like the edit feature of the transcript example).
