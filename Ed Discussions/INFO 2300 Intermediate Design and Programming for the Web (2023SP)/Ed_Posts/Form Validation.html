 For the form validation criteria, are we restricted just to validating whether the entry is empty or not or we can also do length checks/range checks/etc. ?

  Good question. The project 2 requirements only require that you check for required form data (not empty). However, you may

   optionally
  </b>
  do additional validation checks if you wish to do so. Please note that there is no extra credit for doing so.
