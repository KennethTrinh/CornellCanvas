 For the project's requirement's, is it alright if an admin user has access to deleting entries that are not theirs? (Like if an admin user is able to delete a different admin user's inserted entry/record) For clarification, my admin users are students posting textbooks to sell.

  This is a design decision for you to make. If you think an admin should be able to delete other admin's stuff, that seems like a reasonable design decision to me.
