  Followed the lab instructions and got a directory error for ssh key. I was wondering what is wrong? Seems like I'm not getting an error when I try running the ssh-agent, but an error when running ssh-add. I have also tried rebooting, and running on git bash produces errors.

  Yes, I fixed this by deleting my SSH key from last year in my .ssh folder and redid that part and the SSH-agent parts.
