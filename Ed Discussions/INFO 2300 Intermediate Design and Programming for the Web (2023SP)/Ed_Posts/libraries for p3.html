  React is a bit of a problem for this project. It uses client-side rendering, and you're required to use server-side rendering for all projects in this class. You shouldn't use React for this project so that you meet the server-side rendering requirements.
 </p>
 <p>
  Note: 2300 is about server-side programming (i.e. server-side rendering). Next semester, a new class will be offered that focuses on client-side rendering. The new class is considered an alternative to 2300. (You don't want to take both.)
