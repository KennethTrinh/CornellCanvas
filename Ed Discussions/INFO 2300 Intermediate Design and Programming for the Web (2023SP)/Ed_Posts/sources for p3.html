 For Project 3, do all uploaded photos need a source input in the form similar to the lab? Especially if it wouldn't make sense in the context of your project.

  The answer depends on your seed images.
 </p>
 <p>
  If all the seed images were created by you, specifically for this class, then you can simply echo an HTML comment saying that it's original work.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the seed images were not created by you specifically for this class, then you would need to echo out the citation so that it's near the image in the browser.
 </p>
 <p>
  Please see the citation policy for details.
