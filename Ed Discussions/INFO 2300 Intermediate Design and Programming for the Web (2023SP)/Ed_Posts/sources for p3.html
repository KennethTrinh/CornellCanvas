  The answer depends on your seed images.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If all the seed images were created by you, specifically for this class, then you can simply echo an HTML comment saying that it's original work.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If the seed images were not created by you specifically for this class, then you would need to echo out the citation so that it's near the image in the browser.
