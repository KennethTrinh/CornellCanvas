 I currently have 4 tables being used in my Project 3 and I'm struggling on ideas for how to implement filtering by tag because my listings and my tags are JOINED (my listings are inner joined with a different table, and then my tags are joined with the intermediary table associating with a specific listing). Since these 4 tables aren't all JOINED together, I'm struggling how to filter since all the values associated with a specific tag can't be referenced in the joined table with the actual listings

  I'm sorry, I don't understand your database's structure, so I'm not sure how to answer your question. You only need 3 tables to complete this assignment. Please see your milestone feedback. Please also visit office hours, we are happy to help you there too.
