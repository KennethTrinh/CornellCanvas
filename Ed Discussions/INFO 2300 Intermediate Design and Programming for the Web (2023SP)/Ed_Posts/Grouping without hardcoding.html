 Howdy!
</p>
<p>
 For my filtering feature, I have drop down menus grouped by the type of tag. For example, I have 4 tags that are states, 3 tags that are rapids, and 2 tags related to the permits needed for a river. Right now I am hard coding these tags into separate div containers so that I can make drop down menus related to each type of tag. If I were to query the database for the tags and use a foreach loop, I am not sure how I would then group the tags up to keep the usability of the site up. Do you have any recommendations?

  I suggest added a key-valuing code field to categorize tags:
 </p>
 <pre>tags (
  id,
  name,
  category
)
</pre>
 <pre>const TAG_CATEGORY = array (
  1 =&gt; 'Rapids',
  2 =&gt; 'Permits',
  3 =&gt; 'States'
);
</pre>
 <p>
  Now, when you render the tag records, you can use the key value coding to present the different tag categories to users.
