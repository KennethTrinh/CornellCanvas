 When I run my site it says http://localhost:55866/, but other people are posting about 8000 and 8001? Is there an issue that is making me have a different number?

  VS Code will pick a port number that is available on your computer. It sounds like port 8000 and 8001 are not available, so it picked another number. The port number does not matter. It's just where the development server is running.
