  If I have one table for "movies" and one (tag) table for "genres", would joining these two tables in home.php meet the "three table" requirement for p3? I was unsure, because my joined table doesn't have a new name.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Also, should we be able to see the newly joined table in init.sql?

  To meet the requirements of this project, two tables is not sufficient. Three are required. So joining movies and genres would not meet the "three table" requirement.

  As we discussed in class, using a JOIN clause does not create a new table. So you wouldn't see it in init.sql. Please check the notes for JOINs if you think that may help you.
