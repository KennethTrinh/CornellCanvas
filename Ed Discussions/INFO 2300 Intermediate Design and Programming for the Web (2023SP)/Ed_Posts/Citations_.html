  For project 2 in INFO 1300 (Apple Harvest Festival), we were told that we didn't need to have a citation on-screen if we used the instructor-provided content. Do we need to add citations now if we're using that website for this class?

  The citation policy for 1300 and 2300 are the same. So it's okay to use comments to cite the instructor provided content. Please note that this is all content, not just images. Text should be cited too.
