  My form confirmation page works, but it does not take on any of the CSS despite it having a very similar header to all of the other pages. I was wondering if there is something else I can try?

  Hi! Since your header is similar to other pages, I think your CSS is correctly linked to the form confirmation page. Have you checked your CSS class names to make sure there are no typos?

  what worked for me was just adding a / in front of the link ("/public/site.css" instead of "public/site.css" like it was on all my other pages)

  This is the correct solution. This is what was presented in the class notes. Please check Canvas for details.
