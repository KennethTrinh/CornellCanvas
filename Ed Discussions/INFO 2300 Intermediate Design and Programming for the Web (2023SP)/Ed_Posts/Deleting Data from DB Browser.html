  When I delete rows from DB browser, my page will no longer appear when I submit my form. I’ve changed no code, exited out of DB Browser and VSCode, and restarted my computer. I’m not sure why this happened and I have no idea how to fix it since I didn’t change any code.

  Any help or advice would be appreciated.
