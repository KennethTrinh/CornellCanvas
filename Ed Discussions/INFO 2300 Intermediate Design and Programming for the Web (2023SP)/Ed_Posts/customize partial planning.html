  under the partial planning section in the markdown file for milestone 2, the instructions say to "Explain how you will customize at least 1 partial." what does customize mean? i already have my partials planned/designed out, so do i have to do anything additional to 'customize' them? thanks!

  You're on the right track. Customization refers to planning and implementing a partial that works with your website.
