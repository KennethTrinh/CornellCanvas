  How do we insert the tag_id into the entries_tags table? If we have the tag "value" from the insert form saved, how do we get the id associated with that tag? Do we need a SELECT query to get that tag value's id?

  You should be able to use
  <code>
   $db-&gt;lastInsertId('id')
  </code>
  to get the id of the new entry record and use that to
  <code>
   INSERT
  </code>
  a tag_entry record using the entry's id as a second, third, etc. query.

  I came across this requirement:

   Deduction Warning:
  </bold>
  Algorithmically implemented “queries” in PHP is prohibited; you may not retrieve
  <italic>
   all
  </italic>
  records from the database and then use a loop in PHP to ‘query’ through the database. Instead,
  <bold>
   write a single SQL query
  </bold>
  to achieve the same result.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  Can I assume that using a for loop to
  <code>
   INSERT
  </code>
  a tag_entry into the database wouldn't result in a deduction? (i.e, I have n tags to associate with an entry that was created with a form, now I'd like to use n queries to associate each tag with that new entry)

  Got it, thank you! And to get the tag's id, do we need a SELECT query?
