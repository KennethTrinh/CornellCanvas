 Hello,
</p>
<p>
 I am an exchange student and I am unfamiliar with what a design journey is.
</p>
<p>
 I believe it is sketches that illustrate what the final website will look like.
</p>
<p>
 Where can i learn how to properly create one/learn exactly what it is?
</p>
<p>
 Cheers
</p>

  Please see the class notes from today's "lecture." There was an example of a sketch.
