  Hello,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I am an exchange student and I am unfamiliar with what a design journey is.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I believe it is sketches that illustrate what the final website will look like.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Where can i learn how to properly create one/learn exactly what it is?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Cheers
