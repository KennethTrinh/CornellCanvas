  I wanted to verify wether we push a file within the dev container or without the dev container ? I had trouble pushing M1 within the dev container but my friends didn't.  I read ED thread about that but I don't think the SSH is the problem for me. A TA mentioned that we only push outside of the dev container.

  It's easier to push inside the container. But if you've failed to properly configure your SSH agent, then you won't be able to push in the container. It doesn't matter where you push, in or out the container. Both work the same.
