 I've been having an issue with VScode where I cannot push my committed changes to git. I attended office hours and we tried every ssh command in the VScode terminal, none of which worked. I also checked in my computer's terminal that my ssh key is configured. I was wondering if anyone has any advice on how to fix this.

 In the past, I've been able to push from the computer terminal when VScode hasn't let me, but now it seems I can't do either.

  Please see the instructions in Lab 1 for configuring the SSH Agent. If you are unable to push inside the container and the command
  <code>
   ssh -T git@github.coecis.cornell.edu
  </code>
  is successful, then your agent isn't configured correctly. You'll need to run the
  <code>
   ssh-add
  </code>
  command to fix that.
