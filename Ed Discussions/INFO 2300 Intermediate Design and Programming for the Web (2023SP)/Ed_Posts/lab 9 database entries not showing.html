  I'm having trouble getting my database entries to show up after joining the course id into the grades. I'm getting "PHP Warning: Undefined array key "grade" on line 104". Does anyone know how to fix this? I was planning to go to office hours but there are no more office hours today.

  This is likely because there is no "grade" field with the JOIN query. It's probably "grades.grade" now. Please check the debugger to be sure. The inspector really helps troubleshooting issues like this.

  I'm trying to get some virtual OH last minute. The TAs will post in Ed if they're able to do so.
