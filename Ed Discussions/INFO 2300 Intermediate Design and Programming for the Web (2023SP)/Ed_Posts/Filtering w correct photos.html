  Hi! I'm not sure if anyone else has encountered this problem, but I can filter my entries correctly on my home page, but the pictures either don't show up or are the wrong ones. It seems to be almost randomly assigning a picture to an entry when I filter. I know it's probably difficult to diagnose the issue without seeing my code, but I was wondering if anyone has had this problem and has any insight.

  Any guidance would be appreciated.

  This suggests to me that your URLs for your pictures are not using the record's
  <code>
   id
  </code>
  field. I would suggest setting a breakpoint within your for each loop and inspecting the current record's
  <code>
   id
  </code>
  and the
  <code>
   id
  </code>
  that you're echo'ing in the URL.
