  I was wondering if there is a way to make a form (i.e. a contact form w/ a message attatched) link to my email. My thought was to change the action of the form, but that currently points to the confirmation page, so I'm not quite sure how to go about it. Thanks!

  Please do not do this. This does not meet the requirements of the assignment.

  For Project 1, you must show the confirmation to demonstrate the assignment's learning objectives. Currently, there is no way to support emailing the form data with what you have learned.
