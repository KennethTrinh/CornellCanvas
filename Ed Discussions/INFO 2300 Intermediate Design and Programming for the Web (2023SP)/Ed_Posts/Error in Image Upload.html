  When I try to upload an image from my insert form, I'm getting an error "1". When I searched this up, it says that this means "The uploaded file exceeds the
  <link href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.upload-max-filesize"/>
  upload_max_filesize directive in php.ini." How would I address this issue?

  Either increase the max file size to be larger than 1MB or upload a smaller file.
