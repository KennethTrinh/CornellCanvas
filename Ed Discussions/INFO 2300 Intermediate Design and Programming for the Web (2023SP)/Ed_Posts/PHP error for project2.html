  I keep getting these errors in the debug console:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Undefined array key "title" in
  <link href="null"/>
  /workspaces/tk487-project2/pages/home.php on line 53
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  But the array is defined and the values are the same. I spent an hour in OH trying to figure it out but had no luck

  Unfortunately, there's not enough information here for me to help you. I know that you've already been to office hours, but we'll need to take a look at your code to figure out what's going on. I understand that this is frustrating, but without more information, I'm unsure how to help you.

  Hi! I was wondering if you figured out what the issue was? I'm struggling with this too.

  Yes! I put in the wrong name in the value assignment.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  so for example:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  $form_values['example'] = trim($_POST['example-input']);
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  'example-input' should correspond with the name attribute on your input tag
