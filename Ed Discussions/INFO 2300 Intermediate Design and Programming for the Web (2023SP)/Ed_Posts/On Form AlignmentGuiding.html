  For the web form attached below, would it be better design practice to align the Submit button to the:
 </paragraph>
 <list style="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    left, keeping consistent with the left label, right field alignment
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    right, to continue guiding the user from the form's start to finish?
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
 </list>

  As mentioned in the form design lecture, it is good design practice to design a form that will "guide" the user's eyes in an arching patten from the top left to the bottom right, since this is the natural tendency for people from left-to-right reading regions.  In this case, it would make more sense to place the button on the right as the user's eyes naturally end on the bottom right. It can also help to look at how forms on the internet are formatted!
