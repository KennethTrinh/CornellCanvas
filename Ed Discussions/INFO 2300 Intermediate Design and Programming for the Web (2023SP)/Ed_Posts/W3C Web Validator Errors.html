 I'm using Bootstrap 5.0 for my project and the default CSS files throw "This CSS document is not valid" (25 errors). Could I potentially lose points for this? It pertains to the CSS that came in the default download, NOT classes I have written myself.

  Good question. It sounds to me like you downloaded the bootstrap CSS files and added them to your project's public/styles folder, and then imported the bootstrap CSS files into your HTML.

  If this is the case, then you don't need to worry about the bootstrap CSS validating, because it's not your code. It would be unreasonable to expect you to fix a library you've imported for your project. We won't check it, we will only check your "site.css" (or whatever you call it). (Also, shame on Bootstrap for non-validating CSS.)

  I also want to thank you for posting with your name, rather than posting anonymously. It's nice to talk to a name on here (rather than Anonymous), and I want you to know that I appreciate that.
