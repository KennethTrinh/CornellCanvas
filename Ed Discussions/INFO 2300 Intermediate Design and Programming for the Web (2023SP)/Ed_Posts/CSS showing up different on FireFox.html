  Hi, for my Project 3 Form, all of it is aligned correctly with each other in Google Chrome, Safari, etc. However, when I test it in FireFox, the CSS alignment gets all messed up. The form is fine in literally every other browser except for Chrome. Do you know what might be wrong with this? Also, if I submit it like that, would I get a lot of points off for design? (The design only doesn't look right in FireFox).

  Thanks

  There's not enough information here for me to know what's going on. Both FireFox and Chrome are standards compliant browsers. So these types of issues are rare. The only thing I can think of is check that you're not using an
  <code>
   webkit-
  </code>
  prefixed CSS properties. These won't work in FireFox, they only work in Chrome. I hope this helps!
