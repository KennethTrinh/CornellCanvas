  I'm trying to delete test data that I entered in my database, but I keep getting the following error message:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Error deleting record: FOREIGN KEY constraint failed (DELETE FROM "main"."products" WHERE rowid IN ('21', '20', '19', '18', '17', '16', '15');)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Does anyone know how to fix this?

  This means you need to delete all records with the same entry id in your
  <code>
   entry_tags
  </code>
  table.
