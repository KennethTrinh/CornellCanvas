 Hi, there's no TA here for the 12-1pm office hours in Rhodes 590. I've been here since 12 with one other student - will a TA will show up, or has there been a change not yet reflected on the official course schedule? Thanks!
</p>

  We're sorry that you went to office hours and no one is there. I'm looking into what happened. As far I as I know, a TA should have been there.

   Hi, I am the TA for this office hour. I arrived approximately 20 minutes late today because of an unexpected traffic issue. So I extend my office hours to 1:30 pm. I have already helped with this student's project. ðŸ˜Š
