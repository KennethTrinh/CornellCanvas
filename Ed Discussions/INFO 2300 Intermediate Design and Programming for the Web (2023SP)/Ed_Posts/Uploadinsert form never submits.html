 For my insert form page, all of my input fields (name, description, image, etc.) all appear and are able to be selected/filled out, but when I hit the upload entry button, my website just stays on the same page and does nothing (it just stays loading on the page). I made sure my image was the right size, but it still does not insert into my site. This issue also does not produce an error message because the page just stays loading so it has been difficult for the TAs and me to solve.

  I'm not sure what's going on without seeing your code and your computer, but this sounds to me like you may have a breakpoint set. Probably within the insert processing code. Check the debugger toolbar in VS Code and see if the "resume" icon enabled when your issue happens. If that's the case, resume by clicking the resume button or remove the breakpoint if you no longer need it. I hope this helps!
