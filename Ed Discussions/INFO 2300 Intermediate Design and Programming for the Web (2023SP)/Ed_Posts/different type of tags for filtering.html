  I saw on another post #398 that we don't have to group the tags for filtering. Does this mean that filtering is just displaying the one item with that tag? Say I have color as a tag can I put on my form color:      and let the user type in what color? If I get two tags of red would it display on the filtering Red Red. Im confused I thought the requirements were to group the tags together?

  For filtering I thought we grouped the tags. For mine I have color so many items are black. For filtering are we supposed to have a link for black or are we supposed to have links for all the different types of tags?

  No where in the Project 3 requirements are tags required to be grouped together. (If I understand your question correctly).

  Filtering means just displaying the entries for one tag.

  I don't understand the "red red" and why it would display that way. Would you please show me your design and website during the class office hours tomorrow/
