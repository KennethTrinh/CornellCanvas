 When office hours are cancelled can it be updated in the official office hour schedule on Canvas? It is a little frustrating to have come to the office hours location and to see that there is no TA available with short notice.

  We always try and update it. But sometimes we aren't given enough notice from the TAs to update it. It is the official policy that we update the calendar and if we are given sufficient notice, we do update it accordingly.
