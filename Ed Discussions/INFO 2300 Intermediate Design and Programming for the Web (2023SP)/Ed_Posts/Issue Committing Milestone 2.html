  I tried to stage my changes for milestone 2, and git will not let me even stage the changes. I keep getting this warning and I am not sure what it means/how to fix it.

  When I got that error I made sure my changes were committed and then I reopened vscode and it worked.

  If you open the git log, it will often give you a git command you can run to fix this problem. Check the log and run the command, if it exists. Otherwise, please visit office hours for help. We can better help you there.
