  Over the winter break, I re-designed and re-coded my INFO 1300 group website 100% myself using the Bootstrap framework.  I would like to use this website for Project 1, but I cannot find anything in the project requirements document the explicitly forbids or permits this.  As such, I am wondering if I would be allowed to use this website for Project 1?

  For reference, the website is:

  There are no limitations on external libraries for the existing static website. You may use a static website that uses bootstrap.
