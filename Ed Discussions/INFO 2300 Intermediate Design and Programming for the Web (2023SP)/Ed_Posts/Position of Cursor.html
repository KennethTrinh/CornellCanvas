 Hi! I was wondering if there's a way to set the cursor position so that it's not in the middle of the text box, which appears to be the default (see below). If possible, I'd like it to be in the top left corner. Thank you!

  I would need to see your implementation to get a sense of the CSS properties you're using. Without that, I'm not 100% certain what's going on. Please consider visiting office hours. We'll try to help you there once we're able to see your CSS.

   Hi! Did you add extra top and bottom paddings to this input? That may be why your cursor position is in the middle.

    I tried removing the padding and it, unfortunately, didn't do anything :(
