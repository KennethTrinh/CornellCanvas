  When I tried displaying images from the uploads folder, I used this file path, "/public/uploads/photos/[id].[extension]" ("photos" is the name of the entries table). But I constantly got this error, "GET http://localhost:8001/public/uploads/photos/11.jpeg net::
  <bold>
   ERR_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH 200 (OK)
  </bold>
  ". Every time I refreshed the page I got this error for some of the images, and the set of images that failed to load each time seemed to be random. However, everything works perfectly if I use "/uploads/photos/[id].[extension]" as the file path.

  Another problem that might be related to file path is embedding javascript. All scripts are put inside the public/scripts folder. And I wrote:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  &lt;script type="text/javascript" src= "public/scripts/jquery-3.6.1.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  &lt;script type="text/javascript" src= "public/scripts/dropdown-tags.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  at the end of the page.
 </paragraph>

  Sometimes I got an error saying
  <bold>
   "Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined at dropdown-tags.js:3:1"
  </bold>
  , but sometimes it worked fine.

  My TA and I tried debugging for an hour, but it turned out nothing worked. Can you kindly provide possible solutions to these? Thanks very much.

  I understand that you've been working with a TA on these issues. Please review the file uploads class notes and review the path and URL differences. Observe that there is a / in front of the URL and not the path. You need to you the path to move the uploaded files and the URL for displaying images. I would also check that your files in public/uploads/photos are valid files and photos. After uploading, go to the folder in your windows explorer or finder and try and open the uploaded files in a tool like preview. This will tell you whether the files are valid.

  Please refer to the routing class notes for URLs. All URLs should begin with /. It seems like you need to update your script tag to have the URLs start with /

  I hope this helps!
