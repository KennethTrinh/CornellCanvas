 I keep having this issue with Docker, and am unable reopen in a container because of this. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling Docker multiple times, and have ensured that I downloaded the right version that aligns with my Apple M1 chip.

   It is unlikely that you'll be able to use your computer this semester to complete the assignments. Please see the instructions in Lab 1 for using the virtual engineering labs. You will need to use them to complete your assignments this semester.
