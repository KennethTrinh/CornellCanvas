  I know that seed images must be sourced, but I am struggling with how to do it as I only have php that echos out, rather than different code for each seed.

  You will need a field in your database for the citation. You will then need to render the citation in your HTML output when "echoing" records. I hope this make sense. Please feel free to follow-up.
