  I'm on a Mac Apple silicon chip.

  I tried pushing Lab 2 earlier but it was just endlessly trying to push.

  I tried closing the container and reopening VSCode in a different window without having a container open. I tried to push then and it still didn't work.

  I tried to reclone the repository from Git to copy and paste my work into it and recommit then push but I'm unable to reclone the repo.
