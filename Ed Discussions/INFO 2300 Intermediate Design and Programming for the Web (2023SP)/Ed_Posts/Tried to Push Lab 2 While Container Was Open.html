 I'm on a Mac Apple silicon chip.

<p>
 I tried pushing Lab 2 earlier but it was just endlessly trying to push.
</p>
<p>
 I tried closing the container and reopening VSCode in a different window without having a container open. I tried to push then and it still didn't work.
</p>
<p>
 I tried to reclone the repository from Git to copy and paste my work into it and recommit then push but I'm unable to reclone the repo.
