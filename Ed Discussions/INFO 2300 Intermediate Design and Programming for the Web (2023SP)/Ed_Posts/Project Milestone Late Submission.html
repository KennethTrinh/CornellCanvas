  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If we got low grades on a project milestone, could we resubmit the milestone submissions by the late credit deadline for the 70 percent graded weightage?

  I understand that you would like to resubmit work that has already been graded. Unfortunately, redos or resubmissions are not provided for this class. We grade everything once. We are unable to accept another submission after we have graded your work.
