  Yes, your code should always validate. It required for best practices and accessibility. I hope this answers your question! Good luck! :)

  does this include css validation? im using a components library to write the styling as part of the optional challenges in p3. everything is rendering correctly, but w3c is saying that there are bugs with specific styles in specific places. i think it has something to do with the docker container we're doing development in, and this particular library didnt fall under the specific container config .

  how severe is this? should i look to try and debugging these errors, or is functioning styles negligible in the p3 rubric?

  Your CSS should validate. Even though the library CSS won't. This issue is independent of the docker container. They are completely unrelated issues.

  Remember the scope of this project. It's large. So everything is really boils down into 1 or 2 points. You should make a call whether you think this is important.
