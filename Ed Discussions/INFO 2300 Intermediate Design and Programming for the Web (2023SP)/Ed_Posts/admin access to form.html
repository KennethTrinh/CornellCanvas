  I have my insert form on a separate page. Is it ok if I just hide the link to the insert form when I am not logged in as an admin? Or do I need to do something else?

  This is a design decision, and it's a very common design pattern: don't publicly list the admin links to the consumer user! This seems like a perfectly fine thing to do. Just make sure you provide instructions in the design journey!
