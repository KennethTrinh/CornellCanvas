  Is it possible to make a form sticky with a &lt;textarea&gt;? Looking at the documentation, there doesn't seem to be a 'value' attribute for &lt;textarea&gt; like &lt;input&gt; does, so I was wondering how to display the already submitted information in this &lt;textarea&gt;.

  The value attribute sets the initial value for &lt;input&gt; which doesn't have a closing tag. With &lt;textarea&gt;, you have both opening and closing tags, so you can set the initial value just by writing it in between the two tags. I hope this helped!
