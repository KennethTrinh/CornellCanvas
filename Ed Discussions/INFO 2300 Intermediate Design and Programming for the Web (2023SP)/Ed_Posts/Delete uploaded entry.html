 Hello
</p>
<p>
 I uploaded duplicate entries to my sql when I was testing out the form. I wanted to delete the duplicated entry but I wasn't able to open the sql through DB browser. Could you help me with this?

  Something else has gone wrong here, and we would need to see your computer in office hours to figure out what's gone wrong.

  Instead, simply delete your database. It will reinitialize using your init.sql script. That should fix it.
