  I know this problem would be much easier to solve during office hours, but I am currently at them and the TA did not show up so I apologize if this question leads to a long answer.

  In lab the other day my commits were not being pushed onto git hub. I would commit my changes, but this would happen (see the image below). My TA was able to push my changes onto Git Hub through the terminal, but I don't remember exactly what commands she typed. What are the steps to push your changes through the terminal?

  Hi! "Sync changes" means "push commits to server". Have you tried clicking this button?

  I'm sorry that the TA didn't show up. Please also know that I have office hours at this time as well, and I'm happy to help you with these problems.

  In general, to keep things simple, if you want to put all your code changes on GitHub (the website with your repositories) via a command line (e.g. terminal), you can follow these steps:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  First, navigate to the project directory, e.g.
  <code>
   cd ~/info2300/lab1
  </code>
  . Then:
 </paragraph>
 <list style="number">
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    <code>
     git add &lt;file name(s)&gt;  # For example: git add .  &lt;- this will add all files in the current directory to be committed
    </code>
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    <code>
     git commit -m "Title of commit message"  # For example: git commit -m "Changes to Lab 1 website frontend"
    </code>
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    <code>
     git push  # Usually this will work without issues, however if you see some message about "failed to push upstream" then try following the suggested fix in the message and try again.
    </code>
    <break>
    </break>
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
 </list>

  Omg thank you for this - VS Code takes SO LONG to Commit (with the image files from our current website added on). Terminal is much faster.
