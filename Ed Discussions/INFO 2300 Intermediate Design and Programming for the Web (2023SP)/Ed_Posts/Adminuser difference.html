  I'm confused about differentiating between the two
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Are
  <bold>
   USERS
  </bold>
  individuals who can view the site but
  <bold>
   cannot
  </bold>
  login
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Are
  <bold>
   Admins
  </bold>
  individuals who can view the site AND
  <bold>
   can
  </bold>
  login and make changes
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  if so, do we need to create a admin group table? and do we have to run this code below?
 </paragraph>
 <pre>define('ADMIN_GROUP_ID', 1); // see init.sql

$is_admin = is_user_member_of($db, ADMIN_GROUP_ID);
</pre>
 <paragraph>
  I am confused about this, I feel that I have a very large amount of tables and feel that my work is far removed from what's expected.

  Consumers are not required to login. Some designs may have this. If you do, you will need a groups table, etc.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Administrative users are required to login. If you only have administrative users, you don't need groups, etc. because everyone who logs in would be an admin.
