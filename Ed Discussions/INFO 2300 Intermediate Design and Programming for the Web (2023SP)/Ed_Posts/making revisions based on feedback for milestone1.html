<p>
 if the feedback for milestone 1 was all positive (no suggestions given, "great job!" in area for comments), do we need to make any revisions to our project based on the feedback? i still have aspects of my site that i want to change based on what we've learned in class, but i do not have anything to change based on my feedback. thanks!

  Milestone 1 is graded for completion. A completion credit will be awarded as long as you made a good-faith effort to complete the milestoneâ€™s requirements.

  If the feedback was all positive, that means you're likely on the right track. If you have areas you can improve or polish, always go back and revise for the final submission, which will be graded for correctness.
