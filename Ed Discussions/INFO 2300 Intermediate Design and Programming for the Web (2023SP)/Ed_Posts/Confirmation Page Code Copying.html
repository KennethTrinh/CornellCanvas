 In all of the confirmation page examples, Prof Harms uses the tags &lt;dt&gt; and &lt;dd&gt;, is this considered code copying if we follow the same format? Also is this the preferred way to present information on the confirmation page?

  Good question
 </p>
 <p>
  If you are using my code as a reference, that is studying it so that you can use the same ideas in your own code independently, then it's not copying.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you're copy and pasting my code into your project, then that would be a copy.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you're putting my code and your code side-by-side so that you can type out an identical copy, that would be a copy.
 </p>
 <p>
  But using the same ideas from my code, is not copying. This includes using
  <code>
   &lt;dt&gt;
  </code>
  and
  <code>
   &lt;dd&gt;
  </code>
  . That's simply using the code as reference. Professional programmers use example code all the time as a reference. It's considered best practice, and you are encouraged to do the same thing!
 </p>

  I really just want you to learn so that you'll be successful in classes that have 2300 as a pre-req. Learning this stuff means writing the code yourself. That's all I'm trying to do here. I just want to make sure you leave this class having learned what you need to learn to be successful.

  Does this answer your question? I'm happy to help you more if you need it. Please feel free to come and talk to me, etc.
