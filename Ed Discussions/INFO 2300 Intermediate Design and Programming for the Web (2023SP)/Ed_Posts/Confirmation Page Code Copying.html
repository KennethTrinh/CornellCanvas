  In all of the confirmation page examples, Prof Harms uses the tags &lt;dt&gt; and &lt;dd&gt;, is this considered code copying if we follow the same format? Also is this the preferred way to present information on the confirmation page?

  Good question
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If you are using my code as a reference, that is studying it so that you can use the same ideas in your own code independently, then it's not copying.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If you're copy and pasting my code into your project, then that would be a copy.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If you're putting my code and your code side-by-side so that you can type out an identical copy, that would be a copy.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  But using the same ideas from my code, is not copying. This includes using
  <code>
   &lt;dt&gt;
  </code>
  and
  <code>
   &lt;dd&gt;
  </code>
  . That's simply using the code as reference. Professional programmers use example code all the time as a reference. It's considered best practice, and you are encouraged to do the same thing!

  I really just want you to learn so that you'll be successful in classes that have 2300 as a pre-req. Learning this stuff means writing the code yourself. That's all I'm trying to do here. I just want to make sure you leave this class having learned what you need to learn to be successful.
