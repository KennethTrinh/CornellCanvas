  I took 1300 last semester and we got extra credit for unused slip days. Does that apply for 2300?

  If you read over 2300's syllabus, you'll notice this is missing. No such policy exists this semester because providing extra credit for slip days caused equity concerns for students with accommodations. Please feel free to come and chat with me during my office hours if you have additional questions or concerns.
