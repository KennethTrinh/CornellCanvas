  I created a partial for my header/navigation bar and when I add it to my site's pages, only the navigation bar shows up on the page and the page's content does not, but when I remove the partial all of the content is there - why would the partial make my site's content disappear?

  It sounds like you've got an error in your code. You might check the console for an error. If there isn't one, try visiting office hours. We really need to see your code here to help you.
