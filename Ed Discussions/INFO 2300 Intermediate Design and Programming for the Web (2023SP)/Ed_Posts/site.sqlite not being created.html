  I used the following code to open my database: $db = init_sqlite_db("db/site.sqlite", "db/init.sql"); but when I run the code, no site.sqlite file shows up in my db folder like I thought it was supposed to as a result of this line - is there something else I need to do to create a local site.sqlite file?

  Check the PHP/Debug Console. It's likely that you have a syntax error in your init.sql file. Test the init.sql file like we did in class and in lab.
