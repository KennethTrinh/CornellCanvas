  My project is a gallery of album covers (with corresponding info like the album's name and artist who created it) - would I have to cite them with the URL from where I got the images of the album covers themselves, or would the artist name count as the citation?

  According to the citation policy, you should cite the creator of the resource. It's unlikely the creator is the website you pulled them from, so I guessing it should be the artist, etc.
