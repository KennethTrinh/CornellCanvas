 In the directions for Consumer Audience goals, it states a hint at the end: "Users will be able to view all entries in the catalog and insert new entries into the catalog. The audience's goals should probably relate to these activities."
</p>
<p>
 However, in the directions, it states that users should not be able to insert any new entries and only the administrator should have this privilege. So, I'm wondering- Should consumer users have the goal of adding new entries into the catalog or not?

  This is a mistake. it should read:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <b>
   Hint:
  </b>
  Users will be able to view all entries in the catalog and the details for a catalog entry. The audience's goals should probably relate to these activities.
 </blockquote>
