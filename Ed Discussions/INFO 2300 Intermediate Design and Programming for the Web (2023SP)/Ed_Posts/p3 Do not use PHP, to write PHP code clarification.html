  "Do not use PHP, to write PHP code" was written under implementation requirements for project 3. I was wondering if anyone could clarify what this exactly means?

  Some students in past semesters used PHP to render PHP files on the server.

  For example, instead of coding one details page PHP file, some students render a new PHP file (not HTML) for every details page after the user inserts into the database (i.e. cat.php, dog.php, cow.php, etc.) It's a terrible idea. So long as you're using the methods presented in class, you don't need to worry about this requirement.
