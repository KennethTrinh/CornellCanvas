 "Do not use PHP, to write PHP code" was written under implementation requirements for project 3. I was wondering if anyone could clarify what this exactly means?

  Some students in past semesters used PHP to render PHP files on the server.
 </p>
 <p>
  For example, instead of coding one details page PHP file, some students render a new PHP file (not HTML) for every details page after the user inserts into the database (i.e. cat.php, dog.php, cow.php, etc.) It's a terrible idea. So long as you're using the methods presented in class, you don't need to worry about this requirement.
