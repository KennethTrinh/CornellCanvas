 Project 1 says that the website that we should be using "should have 3-6 pages with only .html, .css, and some
 <i>
  basic
 </i>
 .js files". It also says "You may use Projects 1, 2, or 3 from INFO 1300.".
</p>
<p>
 My question is: I took info 1300 last spring and my Projects 1 and 2 do not include any .js files... Does this mean I can't use them and instead I should opt for my Project 3, which has .js files?

  JS isn't required. So you if you don't have JS in your project, that's just fine. All that's important is that it's 3-6 pages and it's a static website.
