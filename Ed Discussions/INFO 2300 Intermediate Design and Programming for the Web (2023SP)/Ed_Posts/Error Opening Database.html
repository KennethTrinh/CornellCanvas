 I am having an issue opening my database in my project 2. I am using the same code as we used in the labs and in class to open it: $db = open_sqlite_db('secure/site.sqlite');. However, when I do this I get the error
</p>
<p>
 PHP Fatal error: Uncaught Error: Call to undefined function open_sqlite_db()
</p>
<p>
 Stack trace: #0
 <a href="null">
  /workspaces/project2/router.php
  (46): require() #1 {main}  thrown in
  <link href="null"/>
  /workspaces/project2/pages/home.php
 </a>
 on line 35
</p>

 I do not get this error when I use the same code to open a database in the labs or in-class examples that we get. I have SQLite downloaded and it has worked fine in the past. I have even gone so far as to copy the code from class and labs that I know have worked into this file, and I still get the error. What would be the best way to  overcome this problem?

  Please see the class notes for 3/1. You're missing the first step necessary to open a database in PHP. You need to load the library.
