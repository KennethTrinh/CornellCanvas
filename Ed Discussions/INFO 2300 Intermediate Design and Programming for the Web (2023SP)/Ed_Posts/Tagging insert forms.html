  Currently, my website contains desserts recipes, and tags for these recipes include prep time and origin. In my insert form, I currently have two drop downs; one to select the origin, the other to select prep time. So, each recipe has 2 tags. Does this meet the project specification? Or would I need to have a multi-select for the tags in the insert form?

  This does not meet the assignment requirements because an entry can have as many tags that exist in the tags table. If you have 10 tags, then an entry can be tagged with all 10 tags, not just 2.

  There is a requirement that each seed entry needs at least 2 tags.
