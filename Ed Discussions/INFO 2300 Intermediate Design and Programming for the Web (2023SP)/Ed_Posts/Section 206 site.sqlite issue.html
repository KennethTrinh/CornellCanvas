<p>
 For those in Lab section 206 that were having the same issue but didnâ€™t hear due to time constraints, make sure that you are deleting site.sqlite in your repository after making changes to init.sql and before you start debugging again. Remember, we are not using
 <code>
  open_sqlite_db
 </code>
 for this lab so the procedures are a bit different.
