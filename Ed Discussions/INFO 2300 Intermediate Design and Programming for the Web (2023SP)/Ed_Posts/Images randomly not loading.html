  Each time I load the page a random assortment of images do not load. In the console it says that there is a 404 error and the images are not found. I know this is not the case however because they are exactly the same in my files and, after changing nothing, when the page reloads the image is now found and a different random image is now not found that was found upon the previous reload.

 <paragraph>
  After refreshing the page about 4 times, without changing anything, all of the images load.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I tried reducing the resolution of my images so that they load better and it did nothing.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  What else can I do?

  I looked back in ed and it seems a lot of people are having this issue. Every ed discussion said to attend office hours. Was a conclusion ever reached about this issue? I thought I would ask again because it seems so widespread.

  This, to me, seems to be an error on the browser not my code. Will we be deducted for this?

  This is a known issue and there is not a fix for this at the moment. As long as the images will show up after a few refreshes, you won't be penalized.

  I would try cloning your assignment on the virtual eng. lab computers. See the instructions in Lab 1 for using the remote eng. labs.
