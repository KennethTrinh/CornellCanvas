 I know there are many questions about this on ed but I want to clarify.
</p>
<list style="bullet">
 <li>
  <p>
   There can be an infinite amount of tags per item, hence why we have three tables
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   We are not to use radio button since it doesn't allow for infinite amount of tags
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   We do not have to filter tags
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   We cannot hard code tags into our html
  </p>
 </li>
</list>
<p>
 So my question is are we allowed to use check boxes (which allow the user to choose multiple)? And if we are how are we supposed to label those check boxes? Are we supposed to use key value coding?
</p>
<p>
 I am doing a shopping catalog so I wanted to have check boxes for styles so ◽️Glam ◽️ Vintage
</p>
<p>
 ◽️Boho but how am I supposed to label these select buttons if I cant hard code them?
</p>

  Good questions!
 </p>
 <list style="bullet">
  <li>
   <p>
    There can be an infinite amount of tags per item.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    For the insert form, you should not use radio buttons since it only permits one tag.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    On the view all page, you need to be able to filter by one tag.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    All tag and entry data should be retrieved from the database; no tag or entry data should be hard-coded.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    On the insert form you may use checkboxes for the tags, if you like. There are other solutions as well. You should use the tag data from the tag's data to label these boxes. You should not use key value coding.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    You will need to associate each check box with the tag id using the tag records that you query.
   </p>
  </li>
 </list>
 <p>
  I hope this helps! Please let us know if you have any other questions
