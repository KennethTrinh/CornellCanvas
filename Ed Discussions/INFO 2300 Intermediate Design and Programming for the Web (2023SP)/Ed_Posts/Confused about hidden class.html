  I know that we are not allowed to use the hidden class to display the feedback, but is it ok to initialize the feedback with hidden like we have done in class? The example photo is from class on 3/8 , the lesson we were told to refer to on a different post on ed.

  No. You must use conditional output to display the feedback. The hidden class method is not permitted. You need to demonstrate the learning objective of only rendering the HTML you want (not just hiding it with CSS.) This is an important learning objective for accessibility.
