 I am at the end steps of my lab and I am a bit confused about the "Validating server-side rending HTML" steps. I have no errors in my html code and my site functions properly, but on the citations page I have these errors:

 I am not sure what to do to fix them because there are no errors in my HTML file.

  The HTML isn't valid, and you need to correct it. Please check out the Part IV instructions. You'll need to fix any validation issues.

   does the developer tools checker skip over PHP code? my code has no errors except for "The element “header” must not appear as a descendant of the “header” element." I believe this is because my PHP code is between the header tags and the checker is not reading it

    You're right, I put my PHP code in the wrong spot. Thank you so much!
