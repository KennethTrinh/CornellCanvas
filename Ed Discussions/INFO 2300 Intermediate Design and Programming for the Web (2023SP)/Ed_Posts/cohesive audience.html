  Take, for instance, the audience for the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival. An audience of "everyone" would be too broad and non-cohesive because "everyone" would likely not have the same goals in regards to the Apple Harvest Festival. On the other hand, an audience of "first-year Cornell students" may be too arbitrarily specific because first-year Cornell students would likely not be the only type of visitors to the festival nor website. A cohesive group would be something in between like "Ithaca residents" because they represent a group with similar goals while not being too narrow.
