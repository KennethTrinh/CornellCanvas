 Hi, is there a way we can automatically re-scale images for display, for example, if the user were to upload a picture that is not the optimum size? I remember that in INFO 1300 we were not allowed  to re-size using the width and height attributes in the img tag, so I was wondering whether there was another method?
</p>
<p>
 Thank you!
</p>

  Good question! You should resize the images using CSS. (Like I did with the PlopBox example.)

  There is a way to do this on the server, but we won't learn how to scale images on the server in this class. It requires background jobs. It's a bit of an advanced feature for server-side development.
