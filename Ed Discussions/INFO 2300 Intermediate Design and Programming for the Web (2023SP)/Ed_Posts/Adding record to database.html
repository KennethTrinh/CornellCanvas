 Hi, for project 3, when adding a record to the database, if we used conditionals to check if each tag is selected and had a SQL query within each conditional, would this lead to too many queries?

  I don't understand your question. Would you please elaborate and/or provide an example?

   For example, if I added a product to the database with the tags "red", "sweet", and "expensive", I wasn't sure what is the best way to add these as records into the product_tags table.
  </p>
  <p>
   One way I thought of doing this was by using conditionals,
  </p>
  <p>
   if (red tag radio button is selected) {
  </p>
  <p>
   add id of product, id of red tag in new record of product_tags table
  </p>
  <p>
   }
  </p>
  <p>
   if (sweet tag radio button is selected) {
  </p>
  <p>
   ....
  </p>
  <p>
   }
  </p>
  <p>
   etc.
  </p>
  <p>
   But, I was wondering whether this would lead to too many SQL queries.

  Generally, the issue with too many queries is
  <code>
   SELECT
  </code>
  queries. This typically isn't a problem with
  <code>
   INSERT
  </code>
  queries. Using conditional statements to check which tag to insert, isn't too many queries. If I understand your question correctly, this all seems fine and very normal.
