 I don't understand how the details page will be implemented. Will it be on the same page as the home page? Or will it be a separate page and each media piece will be a link where when clicked, it will go to the separate page?
</p>
<p>
 How will the page be prompted, will we need to change the routing for this?
</p>
<p>
 Can someone provide clarification for this? Thank you
</p>

  Think about visiting amazon. When you visit amazon it shows you a page with a bunch of thumbnails for products, this is the "view all" page. If you click/tap on a thumbnail it takes you to another page that only has information for that specific product, this is the "details" page.
