  I have double-checked my routing routes and they all seem correct. I was wondering if there are any other common errors that may have this outcome.

  There are many things that can cause this. I recommend reviewing the notes for routing and re-checking that you completed each step. If that doesn't help you figure out what's going on, please visit office hours, so we can see your code and help you. Right now it's hard to say what is exactly the problem given the information provided.

  I had the same problem or something similar, since it showed the same message. It may be because you did not configure the PHP server to use the router. One of the videos in the class modules shows it, but basically, you have to type:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  "php -S localhost:3000 router.php"
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  into the terminal so that the PHP server goes through router.php. Hopefully this helps (assuming that you were having the same issue as me), but if not, yeah. Go to office hours.

  Please do not use the command. I'm concerned that you'll not be able to have your efforts graded if you're using it.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Please keep in mind that the graders will not use this command when grading project 1.

   Your project must launch from the "run &gt; Start Debugging" for Project 1 credit.

  I suggest visiting office hours to get this working because using the above command will likely result in a very low score on Project 1.

  My issue was that I did not update launch.json to use router.php, but once I fixed it, the issue went away! I hope this helps
