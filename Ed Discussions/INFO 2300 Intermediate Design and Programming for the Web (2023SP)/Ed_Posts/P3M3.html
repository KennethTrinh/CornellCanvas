 To whom it may concern,
</p>
<p>
 I know we're supposed to have the SELECT and JOIN seq clause separate but how do we do that exactly? because I had one before that combines both but I was told I needed two so I am confused on how to do that!! and I looked at someone who had a question similar to this one earlier but in the lecture notes recommended shows how I did it which was combined but we need two
</p>
<p>
 Thank you!!!
</p>

  I'm sorry, I don't understand your question. There isn't enough detail for me to figure out what you're trying to do for me to be able to provide advice about the queries you need. For example, there are several places that may need a JOIN clause for your website. Without knowing more, I don't know how to answer your question. I might suggest visit office hours for more clarification here.
