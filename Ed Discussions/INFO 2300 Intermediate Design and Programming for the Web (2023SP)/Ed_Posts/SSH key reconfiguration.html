 If i received an error saying permission denied (publickey) when trying to commit my lab 9, should I create a new SSH key or is there a way to reconfigure the key without creating a new one?

  Please see the instruction for submitting at the of end of the lab. It addresses this problem. Your key is fine, you need to reconfigure your SSH agent.
