  Is it ok if I have two tables, one that represents entries and one that represents tags, without including an entries_tags table? All the functionality on my website works using these two tables. It seems to me that an entries_tags table might be redundant or unnecessary.

  I'm curious to know what your site is and how you've implemented it.. it seems that, to fulfill the project requirements, three tables would be needed (one for entries, one for tags, and one to properly link the two)

  My office hours are on Fridays @ 12:30; but if you want a quicker response, there are plenty of office hours being held this week. All of them can be found under 'Resources' on the course Canvas page

  No. This is not okay. As the milestone feedback and project requirements have consistently reinforced, you are required to have 3 tables to implemented this project:
  <italic>
   entries
  </italic>
  ,
  <italic>
   tags
  </italic>
  ,
  <italic>
   entry_tags
  </italic>
  .
 </paragraph>

  The
  <italic>
   entry_tags
  </italic>
  table is not redundant nor unnecessary. It is required to support an entry with 1 million tags and to prevent duplicate data in the database.
