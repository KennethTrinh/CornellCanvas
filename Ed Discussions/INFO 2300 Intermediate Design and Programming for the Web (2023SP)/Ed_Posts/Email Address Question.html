 I am writing "Contact Us" and including an email address as my footer partial, and I cannot find a valid email address for Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival. I am wonderingâ€“ can I make one up?

  This is too funny. I had to contact them last semester for 1300, and I couldn't find an email either. It's really difficult, so it's totally fine to make one up.
