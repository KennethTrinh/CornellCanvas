 If we cite our images on their details page, do we also need to cite them so that they appear on the home page as well? Or can we instruct that their citations are echoed out on each individual details page?

   As a follow-up, if we have the image source url as one of the fields in our init.sql file, do we need to cite it anywhere else?
