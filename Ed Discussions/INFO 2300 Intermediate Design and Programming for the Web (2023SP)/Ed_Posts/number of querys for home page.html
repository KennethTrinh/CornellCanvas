  I was wondering how many querys we are supposed to have for the home page? I have three, and I think that may be too much, but I'm not quite sure how else to do filtering with multiple tags.

  There isn't a requirement for the number of queries you need for the homepage. Some implementations may only require 2 queries, but some may require 3. It's possible that you may need more depending on your design. But most students should have 2-3 queries for their view all page.
