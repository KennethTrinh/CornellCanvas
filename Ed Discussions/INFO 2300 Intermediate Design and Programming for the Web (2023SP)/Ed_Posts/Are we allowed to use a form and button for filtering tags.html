 I thought we were not allowed to use forms and buttons in our websites besides our insert item form? Can we use it for filtering, looking at the milestone 3 rubric I saw it said we can either use &lt;a&gt; or &lt;forms&gt;,

  You can use a form for filtering, but it's harder and query string parameters better align with common design patterns for tags. I strongly encourage you to use
  <code>
   &lt;a&gt;
  </code>
  elements for tag filters rather than a form. This is just like the sort the transcript example from class.
