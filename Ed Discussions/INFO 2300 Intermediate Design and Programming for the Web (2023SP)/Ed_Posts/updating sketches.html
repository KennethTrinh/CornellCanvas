  I added a footer to all of my pages as an additional partial. Do I need to update all of my past sketches since they all now include a footer? Also, if yes, where would I update that? In milestone 2? Please let me know! Thank you!

  If your design has changed, you should reflect those design changes in your design journey. See the part of the project requirements for changing your design. You will add to it in the design journey, not delete the old design stuff.

  Thank you. I guess my question was specifically where to add it in design journey. I added it after revisions based on feedback from milestone 3. Would that be ok?
