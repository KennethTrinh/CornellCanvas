<p>
 I'm confused about the form we are implementing for project 2. I know the purpose of it is for the user to be able to add entries to our database, but what are we supposed to do with their entry? Should we add it to our original catalog or present a confirmation message similar to what we did in lab 7 today saying thank you for your request?

   Do not insert data into the database in this milestone.

  " This means that, for this milestone, your form should not actually add your form inputs to the database. As for a confirmation message, you may choose to echo back the form data "if your persona would expect to see it or echoing back the data is part of common design patterns."
