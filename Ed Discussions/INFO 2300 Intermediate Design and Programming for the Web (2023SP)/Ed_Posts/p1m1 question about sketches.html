 Do our existing site sketches need to include a sketch of both the desktop and mobile display for each page? Or just the desktop display?

  Your Project 1 need not be responsive. In the design journey, there's place to specific whether this is a mobile or desktop site. Whichever ever option you select, use that in your sketches. You don't need to do both, unless you want to do both.
