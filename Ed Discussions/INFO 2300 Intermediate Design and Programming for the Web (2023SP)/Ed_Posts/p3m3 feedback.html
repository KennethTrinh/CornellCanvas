 Hi, just to confirm, does this mean that the file extension should be stored in the entries table? So, there should be no uploads table. Thank you!
</p>
<p>
 - [ ] Server-Side: If file upload data is stored in the database, it's in the
 <i>
  _entries_
 </i>
 table, not in a separate
 <i>
  _uploads_
 </i>
 table.

  Yes, this is correct. If you're storing the file extension in the database, it belongs in the entries table.
