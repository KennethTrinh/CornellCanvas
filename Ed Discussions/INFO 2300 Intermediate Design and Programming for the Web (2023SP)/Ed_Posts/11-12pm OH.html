 Hi, is the 11-12 AM office hours in Rhodes 590 still happening today? The room was dark and there is no TA. I'm here waiting with two other students. Was it canceled or should we keep waiting?

  Please know that when the TAs cancel office hours, we update the calendar right away. The calendar should always be up to date and accurate. We have not been notified of any cancelation. I'm sorry that you went to office hours and that no one was there. I know how frustrating this is.

  I have assigned a head TA to throughly invest the reports of TAs absent in office hours. Once I understand what is going on, I will make changes to prevent this from happening in the future.
