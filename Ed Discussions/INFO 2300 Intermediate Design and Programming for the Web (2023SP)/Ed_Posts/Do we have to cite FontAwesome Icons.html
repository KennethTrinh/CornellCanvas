  I use icons loaded by this icon library  https://fontawesome.com. Do we have to cite them? I simply render them by adding a class, similar to bootstrap and tailwind css and it seems to be a library of the same regard. Do I have to cite this?

 <paragraph>
  ex:
 </paragraph>
 <pre>&lt;i class="fa-solid fa-graduation-cap"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
</pre>
 <paragraph>
  This just renders an emoji / icon

  The citation policy says you need to cite it where you use code you didn't write. For a library, that would be where you import the library. Not every use of the libraries code. Does that make sense?
