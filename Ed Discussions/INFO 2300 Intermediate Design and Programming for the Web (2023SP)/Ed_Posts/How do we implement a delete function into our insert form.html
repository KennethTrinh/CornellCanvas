 I just need some advice on how to get started. Are there any examples of how we would go about deleting entries from our form?
</p>
<p>
 Additionally, on my uploads page, I accidentally uploaded the same file twice. I tried to delete it from my uploads/sub-folder folder but it didn't go away on my page (it just shows up as the link name with no image). How do I remove it?
</p>

  I don't understand what it means to delete entries from our form? Forms don't have entries, they accept data from a user. Please help me by clarifying your question here. I just not sure what you mean, and I don't want to give you the wrong answer.

  That's because you have a database record for it. You can delete the site.sqlite file or open it in DB Browser and delete the old records.

   Is there any way to remove data from a table. For example, my table can have data on song 1, song 2, or song 3. I had a form that can insert new songs, but I want to implement a form that deletes songs that already exist in the table.
