  I copied the sessions.php file into my project 3 but I am unsure about how to change the CSS styling for it. I want to change the color/format of the "invalid username/password" message when a user incorrectly inputs their information, but there is no CSS class to go alongside it in the sessions.php file. How can I change this formatting in CSS? This is the part of the sessions.php file I am referring to

  View the page source where your login form is located. You will see that the login form and its error messages have CSS classes you can use to style them. You can also use the descendant combinator selectors we learned in 1300 to style the rest of the form without needing to modify sessions.php.
