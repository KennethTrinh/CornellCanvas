 I tried making a selection required in lab 3, but after putting required at the end of the input tag for each radio button I was still able to submit the form without selecting a bouquet sample option. Just out of curiosity, how do you make a radio button selection required?

  The
  <code>
   novalidate
  </code>
  in the
  <code>
   &lt;form&gt;
  </code>
  element prevents this from working for now. We learn how to fix that in Project 2. Please keep the novalidate.
