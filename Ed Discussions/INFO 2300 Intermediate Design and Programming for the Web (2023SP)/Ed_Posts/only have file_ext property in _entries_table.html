 for my milestone 3 feedback, i was told, "in the _entries_ table, you only have file_ext property". i am confused on what this means. in my version of the _entries_ table, i have multiple fields, including a file_ext field which has the data type TEXT and property NOT NULL. any help on what this feedback means and how to resolve it is appreciated. thank you.

  I'm not sure without knowing more about this situation. I would suggest submitting a grade clarification request. I'm sorry that I can't be more helpful at this point. I'm just not sure what's going on without more information.

   are both the file_name and file_ext fields required in our entries table or do we only need to include one of those fields? i believe this is where i went wrong because i only included file_ext

    You probably only need
    <code>
     file_ext
    </code>
    . I only included
    <code>
     file_name
    </code>
    in the plop box because it's a "drop box" and I wanted to render the original file name on the web page to the user.
