  Is having tags in the uploads form and being able to filter the new entries once the form is submitted a requirement for Project 3? This is what is listed under the optional section of the project guidelines:

 <list style="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    Support inserting new tags or deleting tags.
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    Support adding more tags to an entry or deleting existing tags from an entry.
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
 </list>
 <paragraph>
  Some TAs I have asked during office hours have said it is a requirement while others have said it is not. Thank you and I appreciate any clarification!

  Yes. It is a Project 3 requirement. You are required to add
  <italic>
   existing
  </italic>
  tags to an entry upon inserting a new entry into your catalog.

  You are required to create your website's tags as seed data. But you aren't required to support users creating new tags that don't exist already in the database. Let's say your tags seed data has the following tags: "cat", "dog", and "cow". You are not required to have an "add new tag" page where a user can submit the form to create a new tag like "chicken". Let's also say that a user wants to delete the "cat" tag. You may optionally create a "delete a tag" page where the user deletes the cat tag and then deletes all relationships to that tag.

  There is no requirement to "edit" the tags of an entry for Project 3. So let's say that an entry was tagged with "cat" and "dog". A user may want to add an
  <italic>
   existing
  </italic>
  tag, "cow", to the entry. You would need something like an "edit entry" page to edit the tags for an entry to add the "cow" tag or remove the "dog" tag.
