  Is there a class example I can reference on how to show corrective feedback on forms using conditional output rather than hidden classes? I saw you responded to an ed post saying to look at the class notes from 3/8. but that class activity does not properly display the message in the final branch.

  Part of the learning objectives of this course is learning to apply techniques and methods to unfamiliar problems. The conditional output learning objective for Project 2 is one of these cases. I have not provided an example for students to directly copy from for using conditional output for corrective feedback. This is intentional. You will need to synthesize the material from class 3/8 and apply those ideas to

  display the corrective feedback.

  In an introductory level programming course, examples that look nearly identical to the homework are common. This is known as near transfer learning.

  In an intermediate level programming course, the examples will look structurally different from the homework. This is known as far transfer learning. The conditional output examples are structurally different than how you will use conditional output to render or not render the corrective feedback in Project 2.
