  The assignments in this class only permit one database. You should only store data in one database for Project 3. However, to answer your question, you would need to connect to another database and store that connection in a different variable. For example, the connection to the second database could be called
  <code>
   $db2
  </code>
  , etc.

  After inserting a record into a table, you can use the
  <code>
   $db-&gt;lastInsertId('id');
  </code>
  to get the id of the last record you inserted and use this value to insert records into your
