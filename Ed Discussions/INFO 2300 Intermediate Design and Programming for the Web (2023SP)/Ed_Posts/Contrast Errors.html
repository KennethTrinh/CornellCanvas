  Yes, Project 1 is required to pass the WAVE audit. You don't need to fix alerts/warnings/notices. You do need to fix errors, including contrast errors, to ensure your revised Project 1 site is accessible.

  For the contrast errors, I am specifically wondering which guideline we need to comply with - is AA enough or do we need to comply with AAA?

  As I read my original post again, I realize that wasn't clear - sorry about that.
