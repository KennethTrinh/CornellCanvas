  If I am designing my catalog for a phone, should I design the website for 640px in width? Or what should I use?

  Recall from 1300 that we don't want to design for specific widths because there are so many different widths. Rather for narrow screens we want to utilize the available horizontal space. That often means using relative dimensions to set the content.
