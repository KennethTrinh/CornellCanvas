 I'm writing the consumer audience goals for p3m1. I'm confused why the design journey says users are able to insert new entries into the catalogue. Isn't that the administrator audience's role? My website is a catalog of pets up for adoption locally. I thought the consumers would be viewing the site to see the available pets and the administrators would be adding/deleting entries based on availability. Maybe my topic is not sufficient for the project? Or, am I misunderstanding what we are writing for the consumer audience goals in the design journey?
