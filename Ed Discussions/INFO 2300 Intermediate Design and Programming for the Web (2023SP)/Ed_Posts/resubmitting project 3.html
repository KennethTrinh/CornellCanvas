  I already submitted the submission form for p3fin, but I just realized something that I forgot to fix before turning it in - is it ok to submit the submission form twice if I make changes to my project?

  Yes, if you submitted the form after the normal deadline, you may resubmit as many times as you like
  <italic>
   before
  </italic>
  the
  <italic>
   slip-day
  </italic>
  deadline; we only start grading slip-day submissions
  <italic>
   after

  the

  Unfortunately, if you submit before the deadline, we've already started grading your submission. Since we've begun grading it, we don't typically accept resubmissions. If there are extenuating circumstances, please let us know by email info2300@cornell.edu and we'll work with you.

  Please see the first page of the submission form for the resubmission policy.
