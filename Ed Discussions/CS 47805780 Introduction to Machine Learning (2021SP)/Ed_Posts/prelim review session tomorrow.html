  What will the format of tomorrow's prelim review session be? Will it be mostly Q&amp;A? Is it only intended to cover the prelim practice questions, or can we also bring general content questions?

  I was planning to keep it in a pretty open format where people can come with their questions. I expect that many questions will be around the prelim practice questions, but I am happy to take any questions that you may have.
