 To see whether a dataset of size N can be shattered, do we make any assumptions about whether these N points are located?

  This is a great question.
 </p>
 <p>
  In short, yes, you need to fix them. But, you can fix them anywhere you like.
 </p>
 <p>
  e.g. hypothesis space of circles, where the inside is positive and outside is negative, cannot shatter 3 points in a line like + - +. However, if you moved the middle point up in space a little, suddenly you can get all possible combinations using circles. So, circles can shatter a set of 3 points.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then to show that the VC dimension is 3, you'd have to prove that no 4 points is shatterable by circles no matter how you initially place (and then fix) them.

   will it give a different answer if the initial positions are different?

    Err, not quite? You want to find the largest n such that n points is shatterable. That means for any given n points, you want to arrange them in the best way possible so that you could potentially label all subsets of those points positive or negative, using only your hypotheses.

   just to clarify my question. So if I have + - + - + with the same x2 value, that would be impossible to classify with the double-rectangular classifier in problem set 5. But if I move the center + upward, then the classifier should be able to classify it perfectly. I was wondering when counting whether a classifier can classify all points correctly, do we fix their position? I feel like if the position is not fixed, then N can be infinite.

    Your intuition about N being infinite if you don't fix them seems right! Sure, I could move all my instance space points around until they fit into a given "donut" just right. But that tells us nothing about the complexity of the donut hypothesis class, which is the point of the VC dimension.
