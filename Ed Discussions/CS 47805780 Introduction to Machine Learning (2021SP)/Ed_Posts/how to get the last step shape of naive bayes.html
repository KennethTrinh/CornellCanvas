 I don't pretty understand how to get the last step. and this is the binary case
</p>
<p>
 what would happen if Y takes more than 2 classes?
</p>

  Taking the argmax of an expression where you're trying to determine whether it's y=+1 or -1 is the same as taking the sign as some expression since the sign is either +1 or -1. Similarly inside the expression you can divide the two possible expressions (substituting y=+1 or -1) to get a ratio and by taking the natural log, if one of the expressions (say the y=+1) is larger than the other, then the resulting natural log of a value &gt; 1 should be positive and likewise the natural log of a value &lt; 1 is negative. It's essentially just computing both expressions and getting a ratio such that the result is either +1 or -1.

  As for when Y is more than 2 classes, essentially you can just think of the argmax having y being however many classes you want, computing all of the probabilities of the X's being a given y and then taking the max value and predicting that class label associated with it.
