 Why is probability of getting a bit incorrect p = 1/2?
</p>
<p>
 I was thinking that probability of getting a bit incorrect should be p = 9/10 ? Since unpsychic students are guessing each bit independently, and each bit can be a digit, and there are 10 total possible digits, then that means that 1 out of the 10 possible digits is correct, and thus the probability of getting a bit incorrect should be p = 9/10 ? That's what I was thinking, but it might be wrong.

  The
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_number_format">
   bits
  </a>
  can only take values

   0
  </i>
  or
  <i>
   1
  </i>
  , so the probability of guessing a bit correctly is
  <i>
   1/2
  </i>
  .
