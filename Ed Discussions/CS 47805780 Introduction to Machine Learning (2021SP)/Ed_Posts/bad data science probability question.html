  Why is probability of getting a bit incorrect p = 1/2?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I was thinking that probability of getting a bit incorrect should be p = 9/10 ? Since unpsychic students are guessing each bit independently, and each bit can be a digit, and there are 10 total possible digits, then that means that 1 out of the 10 possible digits is correct, and thus the probability of getting a bit incorrect should be p = 9/10 ? That's what I was thinking, but it might be wrong.

  The

  bits can only take values

   0

  or

   1

  , so the probability of guessing a bit correctly is
