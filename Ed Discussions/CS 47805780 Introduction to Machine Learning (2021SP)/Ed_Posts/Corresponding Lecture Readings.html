  For the K-Nearest Neighbor lecture, there was a corresponding reading of 19.1-19.3. 19.1 seems to cover the material at a similar scope as the lecture, but 19.2-19.3 seems a bit more involved mathematically and seems to cover information that was not covered in the lecture. Are we responsible for all the assigned reading sections or can we assume that the exams/quizzes/projects will assess a similar level of understanding as the lecture? (also please correct me if I'm wrong in stating that the other sections were more/too advanced)

  Didn't it say
  <code>
   UML 19.1, 19.3
  </code>
  , and not
  <code>
   UML 19.1-19.3
  </code>
  ? It looks like 19.2 is not part of the assigned reading. That's how I took it, anyway.

  That is correct! Section 19.2 is NOT part of the assigned reading.

  I think parts of 19.2 will be relevant later in the course. I would read all 3 sections. I don't think section 19.2 is part of this quiz, but it is still useful to see the material. Don't stress if it feels too technical (especially given that we have not yet seen some of the notation used in 19.2), try to take whatever you can from it.
