  For 100,000 examples, the sample set would be:
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  S=\left\{\left(x_1,y_1\right),...,\left(x_{100,000},y_{100,000}\right)\right\}
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  where
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  x_i\in R^{2000}
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  right? So what is the justification for adding 2001 features to the number examples (100,000) plus the feature dimensions (2000) to get
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  x_{102,000}
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  Seems I am missing something?

  You are adding 100,000 additional features to the original 2000 features for each of the 100,000 training examples.

  Thanks for the clarification. But what is behind the reason for adding features to begin with? Is this collapsing the sample set into one long feature vector?
