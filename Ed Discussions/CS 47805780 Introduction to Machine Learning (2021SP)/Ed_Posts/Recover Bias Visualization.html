 I pass the recover bias tests when I submit, but the output of the recover bias visualization for my solution is clearly incorrect. Does anyone know what could be going wrong?

  I found that the bias function itself was ok, but my dualqp function had errors that were not detected by the autograder that led to the problem I described above.
