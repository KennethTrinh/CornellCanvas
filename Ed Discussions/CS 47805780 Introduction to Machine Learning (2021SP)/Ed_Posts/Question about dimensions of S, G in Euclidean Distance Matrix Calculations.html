 In this question, since S = XX^T, and dim(X) = (n, d), how can S have dimensions n x m?

  This definition, indeed, looks somewhat counterintuitive. Notice that in this definition j does not enter the formula for S on the right-hand sight. Similarly, i does not change input for R. So, via broadcasting this is still a valid formula, i.e. it will still work for the purposes of computing D. For instance, S and R defined as above look as follows (for n=2,m=3):
 </p>
 <math>
  S=\left(\begin{matrix}x_1x_1^T&amp;x_1x_1^T&amp;x_1x_1^T\\x_2x_2^T&amp;x_2x_2^T&amp;x_2x_2^T\end{matrix}\right),\ R=\left(\begin{matrix}z_1z_1^T&amp;z_2z_2^T&amp;z_3z_3^T\\z_1z_1^T&amp;z_2z_2^T&amp;z_3z_3^T\end{matrix}\right)
 </math>
 <p>
  Now, the beauty of this approach is that you can compute S and R (as given above) and the G Gram-matrix from before. Then matrix D is simply a linear combination of these 3 matrices (just expand the formula for D).

   What is the best way to implement S and R with numpy without using loops?

    Is the right train of thought to slice and transpose the inner products of X and Z to create S and R? In attempting P-1 l2distance, I've gone back to P-0 and am currently trying to figure how to make the (2,3)(5,3) assert case pass.
