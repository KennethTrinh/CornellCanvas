 Homework 2 question 2a has a confusing follow up question which asks us to give parameters w,b that specify a logical NOT function and then points out that
 <i>
  w
 </i>
 is a number not a vector.
</p>
<p>
 I found the following thread which classified this as a typo:

<p>
 Does this mean we should assume that we are in fact looking for a linear classifier for the logical NOT function which includes a vector w? If that is the case what is the standard of success to which our NOT should apply? All instances where our AND function evaluates to true? As in if we are given a vector X we should return the opposite of what our AND function would return? Otherwise I'm not sure how we are supposed to interpret NOT for a vector alone. As in NOT vector x for a given vector x doesn't have any sort of meaning I can interpret.
</p>
<p>
 Or are we assuming the input to our NOT function will be the output of some generic linear classifier? In that case I could see why w would be a number (or a vector in R1).

  I don't see where it asks you to create a NOT function.

   It appears I'm using an old version of the questions and a corrected version was released. Thanks!
