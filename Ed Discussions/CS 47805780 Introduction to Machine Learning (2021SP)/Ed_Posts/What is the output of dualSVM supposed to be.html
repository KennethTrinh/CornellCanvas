  I initially tried returning a 1-by-n vector or a n-by-1 vector, where n is the number of rows in xTe, but I got an error both times. I looked in visclassifier, and it looks like it's supposed to be an n-by-n matrix, but, if that's the case, then what does each value of the matrix represent?

  DualSVM outputs a function. This function takes in a matrix X which contains several examples to classify. This function then returns a vector containing -1/+1 for each example in the function
