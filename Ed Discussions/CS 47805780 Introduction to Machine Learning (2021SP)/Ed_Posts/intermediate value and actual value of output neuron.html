 In this slide, it looks like the intermediate value s_{d,1} of the output neuron and the actual value v_{d,1} of the output neuron are different.
</p>
<p>
 However, I remember that, in P4, we saw that the intermediate value and actual value of the output neuron were equal.
</p>
<p>
 So, is it always the case that they are equal, or do we only see this in some cases?

  Whether or not they are equal depends on the use case; for example, if we're trying to approximate a real-valued function you might not want to apply a non-identity activation function to the last layer, but if you're looking for probabilities you'll need to apply a softmax.
