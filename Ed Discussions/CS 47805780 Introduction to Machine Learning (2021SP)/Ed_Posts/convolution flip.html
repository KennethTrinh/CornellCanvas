  In computer vision, we were taught to flip the filter horizontally then vertically before performing cross-correlation. Do we do that for this class?

  I think as far as it applies to material in this course, we never really discuss too many properties of the convolution or practical example with convolving with filters; therefore, I wouldn't worry about it.

  The double flip of the filter for convolution is just for nice mathematical properties anyways, in practice you just do cross-correlation.
