 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 We reviewed all the final projects, and you should have gotten a direct email from me with our comments and feedback. I was really impressed with what you managed to pull together on this challenging real-world problem -- not only what you have learned, but also how you managed to creatively extrapolate this knowledge to this problem. The email contains the comments, and the project grades are on Canvas.
</p>
<p>
 I also just released the overall course grades at

   </a>
  </p>
 </li>
</list>
<p>
 Please look under CS4780, even if you enrolled under CS5780. In case you are curious, the median grade for the course is an A-.
</p>
<p>
 This was a challenging semester, but I hope that the flexibility and safety nets we build into the course made it manageable after all.
</p>
<p>
 I wish you a good summer break! And for those of you who are graduating, best of luck with the next stage in your life.
</p>
<p>
 Cheers
