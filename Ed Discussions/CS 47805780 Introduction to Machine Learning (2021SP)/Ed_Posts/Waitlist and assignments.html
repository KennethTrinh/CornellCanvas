  I am currently 5 on waitlist.  If I receive enrollment pins after prerequisite assignments and quizzes are due, do I still have to submit the assignments and quizzes before I am enrolled? Thank you!

  Yes, you should still submit the prereq assessment and quizzes (especially the prereq, since it is used to gauge preparedness for this course).
