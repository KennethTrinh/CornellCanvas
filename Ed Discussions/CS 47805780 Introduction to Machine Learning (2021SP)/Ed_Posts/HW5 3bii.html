 How did my friend come up with this hypothesis? For example, did they uniformly choose it from $H$? Or did they get a different i.i.d drawn sample set $S'$ and use empirical risk minimization on $S'$? Or something else?

  h_friend is just a completely arbitrary h within the hypothesis class; we don't know how it was chosen.
