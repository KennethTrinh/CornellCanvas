 I've found the wording for this question relatively ambiguous. I'm unsure of the following:
</p>
<p>
 1. What does it mean by how many parameters do you need to classify an example? Is it asking how many parameters to classify one specific example, say X = (1,1,1) or how many parameters so that you have all the information you need to to classify ANY possible example?
</p>
<p>
 2. What level of analysis constitutes a parameter? I could say that P(Y=1|X=(1,1,1) is all I need to know to classify X=(1,1,1) and that would be one parameter. I could also say to find the same value we need P(Y=1), P(X1=1 | Y=1), P(X2=1 | Y=1), P(X3=1 | Y=1), and P(X=(1,1,1)) which I can use to find the same value using 5 parameters.
</p>
<p>
 3. What is the "final event" referenced in the last sentence of the problem statement?
</p>

  the first subquestion in 1b helped me understand what this question is asking for.

   1. It's asking for the number of values you need to store to calculate any classification; i.e. however many parameters you need to completely specify the naive bayes model.
  </p>
  <p>
   2. A parameter is anything used in the naive bayes model, i.e. NB doesn't directly have a P(Y=1|X=(1,1,1)), but rather calculates it using information it has from the training data.
  </p>
  <p>
   2. The "final event" is talking about the one unknown event described in the statement "knowing the probability of all events except one event."
