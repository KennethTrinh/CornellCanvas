  I've found the wording for this question relatively ambiguous. I'm unsure of the following:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1. What does it mean by how many parameters do you need to classify an example? Is it asking how many parameters to classify one specific example, say X = (1,1,1) or how many parameters so that you have all the information you need to to classify ANY possible example?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. What level of analysis constitutes a parameter? I could say that P(Y=1|X=(1,1,1) is all I need to know to classify X=(1,1,1) and that would be one parameter. I could also say to find the same value we need P(Y=1), P(X1=1 | Y=1), P(X2=1 | Y=1), P(X3=1 | Y=1), and P(X=(1,1,1)) which I can use to find the same value using 5 parameters.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  3. What is the "final event" referenced in the last sentence of the problem statement?

  1. It's asking for the number of values you need to store to calculate any classification; i.e. however many parameters you need to completely specify the naive bayes model.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. A parameter is anything used in the naive bayes model, i.e. NB doesn't directly have a P(Y=1|X=(1,1,1)), but rather calculates it using information it has from the training data.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. The "final event" is talking about the one unknown event described in the statement "knowing the probability of all events except one event."

  the first subquestion in 1b helped me understand what this question is asking for.
