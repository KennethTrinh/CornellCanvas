 When we are told to use two different training algorithms does this mean we're supposed to chain two together to achieve our final prediction algorithm? The only algorithm I can think of that can be chained onto another like this is bagging and boosting, someone let me know if I'm wrong. Or can we try two different training algorithms and then submit the better of them to Kaggle?

  Yes your latter guess is correct. You're not chaining them together, you're just making 2 separate algorithms and the better score of the 2 will be counted towards your ranking.
