 Why does this slide say that the algorithm makes
 <b>
  at least
 </b>
 $log_2(n)$ mistakes. I thought that since you make at most depth of the tree # mistakes, before you reach a consistent hypothesis, you make
 <b>
  at most
 </b>
 $log_2(n)$ mistakes.

  My understanding is that for any h_i, there exists a data distribution that will have at least log2n mistakes.
 </p>
 <p>
  The data distribution can be easily constructed by reversing the labels along the tree. That's why you get the log2n bound.

   I think this is specific to this 1D threshold hypothesis . We make you make
   <b>
    at most
   </b>
   log_2(n)log2â€‹(n) mistakes.
  </p>
  <p>
   for the example of the 1D threshold, but other hypothesises are possible that make more mistakes.
  </p>
  <p>
   So the best mistake is log2(n)

    I don't follow. It seems that you are also arguing that we make at most $log_2(n)$ mistakes when the slide says that we make at least $log_2(n)$ mistakes.

     That is for this algorithm and the at least is for all algos in general?
