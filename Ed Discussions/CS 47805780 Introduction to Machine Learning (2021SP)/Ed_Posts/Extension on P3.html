  I hear that it is crunch time for many of you, and I want to help take off the pressure a bit. So, we are extending the deadline for P3 by a week to next Friday (Apr 2) at 5pm. It will not cost you late days, but it is also the very final time to submit.

  So, with only half the lectures this week and the extension on P3, this hopefully clears up some time for prelim prep.
