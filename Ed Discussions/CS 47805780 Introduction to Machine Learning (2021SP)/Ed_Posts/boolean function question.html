  I don't understand how SVMs with kernel can represent any boolean function?

  I understand that a boolean function is a function whose arguments and outputs are binary. And I understand that the polynomial kernel gives a product of sums (i.e. it is in conjunctive normal form). But I don't understand how the conjunctive normal form of polynomial kernels can represent any boolean function?

  Actually, I should have used Disjunctive Normal Form, which is a disjunction of conjunctions (but of course any formula in Conjunctive Normal Form can be translated in Disjunctive Normal Form). The polynomial kernel can represent the conjunctions as a product (especially after introducing two boolean features for each original feature - one for the feature itself and one for its negation). The disjunction is then represented by the sum of Kernels with the alpha coefficients.
