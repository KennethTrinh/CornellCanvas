  The question asks to compute the mean and covariances of the variables that are still normal distributions, but it's not exactly clear what covariance we are talking about (among which two variables are we calculating the covariance). It should be variance, right?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Furthermore, how rigorous do we have to be in proving that they are or are not Normal Distributions? Like am I allowed to utilize well-known properties of the normal distribution? The fact that I'm referring to is not present in the multivariate normal distribution wikipedia page, but is present in the normal distribution wikipedia page.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If not, do I have to prove from first principles that the property holds?

  Yes, compute the variance of whichever variables are still normal. You are allowed to use well-known properties of the normal distribution.
