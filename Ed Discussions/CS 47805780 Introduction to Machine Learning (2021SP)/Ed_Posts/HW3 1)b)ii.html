 When this question refers to the new functional margin, is it asking about the functional margin of (w',b') or that of (w,b)?

  Your (w,b) should correspond to a function margin of 1 (since that's how you found the pair). So, it is (w',b') that you need to compute the functional margin for now in this question.

   This is correct, but I think the students are asking if they are expected to compare the new functional margin to the geometric margin or the old functional margin to the geometric margin. What is expected is that you should compare the old functional margin to the geometric margin, but to be safe also quickly state how the new functional margin is related to the geometric margin as well.

    this is not entirely right. the new set of parameters is (w',b'). The question is explicitly asking about the
    <b>
     new functional margin vs new geometric margin
    </b>
    . Obviously, new here means using the new parameters (w',b'). Functional margin for the old (w,b) is trivially 1 by construction and geometric margin is invariant to parameter rescaling - these are hardly interesting for anything once you know the margins of (w',b').

     I am a bit confused. The lecture slide says, the margin is called geometric margin, if ||w||=1. Since the question asks that ||w'||=1, the margin of (w',b') would be a geometric margin and wouldn't the functional margin and geometric margin for (w',b') refer to the same thing?
