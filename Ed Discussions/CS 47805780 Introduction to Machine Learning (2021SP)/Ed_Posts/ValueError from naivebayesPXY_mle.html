  I've been debugging my naivebayesPXY_mle function for a while. Every time I submit, I get the following error from the autograder:
 </paragraph>
 <pre>ValueError: operands could not be broadcast together with shapes (1600,) (26,)
</pre>
 <paragraph>
  What does this mean? Am I returning vectors with the wrong dimensions or are the contents of those vectors incorrect? (If it's the latter, can I get any tips on how to debug naivebayesPXY_mle? I've tried reviewing my code several times and even using the covid diagnosis example from lecture but I haven't found any bugs.)

  This means that at some point in your code you're either returning a vector with the wrong shape or trying to combine two vectors with incompatible shapes (post likely a + or dot)
