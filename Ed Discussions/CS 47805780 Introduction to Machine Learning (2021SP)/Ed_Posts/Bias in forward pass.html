 Below is the code that initializes weights and tests our forward pass.

 Is there no bias included? If I understand correctly, the input has dimension two, and there are two weights between the first layer and the second meaning there is no weight corresponding to the bias. Are we supposed to add another weight to multiply with a bias unit? Or are we just ignoring bias?

  Yes, it appears that there is no bias in this network. I think there is no need to change this piece of code, just make sure your implementation works. Best.
