  I think one assumption would be that the data is linearly-separable, but I can't think of a second assumption that the Perceptron specifically makes about the data? Is it just that the data must be iid? I'm assuming that iid data is always an assumption, so I wasn't sure if this is what the question was specifically asking for.

  Perceptron also requires the problem to be binary classification.

  Requiring the problem to be binary classification is an assumption about the problem, rather than the data, though. Would this still be a valid answer to the question?

  If yes, would a complete answer to this question be that Perceptron assumes data is linearly separable and that the problem is binary classification?
