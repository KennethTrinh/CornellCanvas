 In the naivebayesPXY_mle function we are asked to return a 1xd vector for each of p(x|y=1) and p(x|y=-1) . However, what does the x refer to? In the slides we have P(X_i = x | Y = y) but upon inspection, the features of X can take more than just binary values. So what is the X_i = x part in p(x|y=1)?

  Well each feature in the training set is a bag of letters so to say. You are essentially finding the $$P(X_{i} \geq 1 | y =\pm 1)$$. This is equivalent to finding $$P(X_{i} = x| y =\pm 1)$$ for a letter x

   I think the 1xd vector represents a histogram-like probability distribution of how often a letter appears in the given dataset.

    Your x's in the problem are essentially a letter within the English alphabet. The reason why you want a 1xd vector is because you need to have the conditional probabilities of a letter appearing  or $P(X_i=x | y = \pm1)$.

     Since the letter can appear more than once, couldn't this also be a case:
    </p>
    <math>
     P(X_i=2\ |\ y=\pm1)
    </math>
    <p>
     But, since we want a 1d array, we can't count the # of occurrences for each letter. So is the goal to calculate whether the letter appears or not? i.e.
    </p>
    <math>
     P(X_i\ge1|\ y=\pm1)
    </math>
    <p>
     ?
    </p>

      I am also wondering this because it seems each feature can only have one value in the resultant posprob/negprob array but by your suggestion @justin we would $k$ entries for each letter that a feature could be

       I think it's simpler than that. You're just trying to find the probability of a letter occurring given a label. So for the 1d array posprob, the first element would be the probability of finding an 'a' given y = +1 across the whole dataset.  Not sure if this is what Justin meant though.
