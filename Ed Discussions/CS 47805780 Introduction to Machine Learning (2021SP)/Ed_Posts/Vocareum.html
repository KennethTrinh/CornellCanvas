 I turned in my project 1 last week and just remembered I need to pay for the Vocareum subscription. I just wanted to check that if I pay now, it won't erase my previous submission for project 1? Thank you!

  Even if it would (which I don't think it will), it would be unreasonable for us to hold that against you. I would bookkeep a version of the project just in case but go ahead.
