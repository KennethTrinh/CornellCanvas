  Are we allowed to have edges that go straight from the input layer to the output layer? Or is that not allowed?

  The question says that "each network must include a single hidden layer" so technically no. But you could get the same solution but setting the edge weight to 1 from the input layer to the hidden layer, using identity function as activation, and and edge weight of 1 from hidden layer to output layer.
