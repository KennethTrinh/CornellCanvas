  The instructions ask for us to draw and explain. In discussion, we created a table examining all combinations of positive/negative for z many points (e.g., z1=-1, z2,z3,z4=1; z1, z3, z4=1 and z2=-1; etc.) I was wondering if we needed to include a table for our explanation, that seems like it would be really large table. Or would it just be sufficient to say that you have to test all combinations of points and we know that we can shift our rectangles such that all combinations of positive/negative points would be classified and give a few test examples that show this?

  You don't have to show a table if you can describe how your set of points can be shattered in a way that still covers all the combinations. For example, you can say "if {x} point has {y} label, then we can shift our rectangle in {z} way," and perhaps this may cover multiple combinations of labeling.
