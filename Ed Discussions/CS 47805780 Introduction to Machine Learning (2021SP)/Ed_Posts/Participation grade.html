 Is the 1% participation grade based on attendance in discussions?

  I want to encourage participation in all forms, including the discussion, Ed, office hours, etc. Participating actively really helps understanding the material, and will thus eventually have much larger impact on your final grade than the nominal 1%. So, while the remaining 99% of the grade are fully specified by a formula, please allow me to be intentionally vague about this 1% at this point ;-). Just participate in the discussion sections and ask questions on Ed or in office hours whenever you have them, and I promise that you will have the opportunity to get that 1%.
