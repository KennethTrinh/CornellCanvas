 In case we are, are we allowed to use the package for minimization, since we haven't yet covered how to solve constrained optimization and the Perceptron algorithm won't give us the optimal hyperplane? Also, what does an "SVM package" refer to? Like a library for Python/other languages?

  You shouldn't need to use any minimization packages. Think about how SVM's are defined - do all feature vectors affect the SVM hyperplane?

  An SVM package refers to any package that explicitly calculates the SVM for you.
