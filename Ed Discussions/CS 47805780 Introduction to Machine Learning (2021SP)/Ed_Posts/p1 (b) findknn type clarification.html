  Is there anything peculiar about the
  <code>
   dtype
  </code>
  of matrices
  <italic>
   indices
  </italic>
  and
  <italic>
   dist
  </italic>
  needed in order to pass the tests? My understanding is that indices should have dtype int and dist float. I have worked through a simple example with two matrices and am confident my solution works to the outlined specs. But of course, I am unable to pass the tests.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Just to reinforce my understanding of the question: the entries of
  <italic>
   indices
  </italic>
  are single numbers representing the row index of the i^th-nearest neighbor of the j^th column. So the (1,1) entry of matrix indices would be the index of the
  <italic>
   first
  </italic>
  nearest neighbor to the
  <italic>
   first
  </italic>
  instance in xTe in the xTr matrix.

  indices[i,j] is the index of the ith nearest neighbor of the jth test point, and dist[i, j] is the corresponding distance. Make sure you're 0-indexing though, i.e. (0, 0) corresponds to the nearest neighbor of the 0th test point, not (1,1).

  Thank you. I am 0-indexing that was a slip in my own explanation. Can you clarify: indices[i,j] is the index where? In xTr?

  xTe is the matrix of the test points and xTr of the training points; indices[i, j] should then correspond to the index of the ith nearest point in xTr to the jth point in xTe. Does that make more sense?
