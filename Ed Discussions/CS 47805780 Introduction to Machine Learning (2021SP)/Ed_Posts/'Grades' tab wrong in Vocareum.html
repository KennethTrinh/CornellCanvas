 My submission report for Project 1 indicates that I've passed all 13 tests, but when I click on 'Grades' on the top right it shows 'Total score 0/13'. I assume this is a mistake?

  It should be resolved now. Please try to resubmit. Let us know if that still doesn't work. Sorry for the inconvenience.

   This seems to be an issue with multiple students, we'll get back to you.
