 For some reason, I got a total score of zero, with a correctness score of 90, and competition score 10of . Is it the expected result?

  Another student who was having this issue said it was resolved after they removed some extraneous testing code in one of the other boxes (even though it wasn't contained in a &lt;GRADED&gt; segment).  Let us know if this issue is persisting and we can take a closer look to see why this might be happening for your submission
