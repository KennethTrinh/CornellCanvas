  This problem asks for "expected class entropy after a binary split". Is this the same as the following:

  Or, is there a difference between the

  entropy after a binary split, and just the entropy after splitting?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  To find the expected entropy after a binary, would we need to use the above formula to find entropy, and then take expected value? If yes, would the expected value of the entropy just be the entropy itself, since the entropy (after computation) ends up being a constant?

  the expected entropy is just the entropy by definition and you do not need to take expected value.
