  Hello, I got a geometric margin for 1ciii but it is not greater than 1/2. The problem says to "revise your answer to have a wider margin" if this happens but i have no idea what this means and I've been stuck for a while. Can anyone give me a hint?

  Try and think of it as this: set/find weights for all elements in the sets L, G, and Q (ii); find the smallest margin that exists when taking the dot product between w and x (functional margin for iii) and use that and your weight vector to find the final lower bound geometric margin.
