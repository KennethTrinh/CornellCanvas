 A follow-up question on thread #1012. Problem 2b reads "...the brute-force algorithm naively considering
 <underline>
  all possible English word sequences
 </underline>
 ..." I was wondering whether the underlined part should indeed be "all possible part-of-speech tag sequences"? The English word sequence should be given to us and we are trying to find the part-of-speech tag sequences, so brute-force on part-of-speech tag sequences makes more sense to me.

  Yes, you are correct. It is a typo on our part.
