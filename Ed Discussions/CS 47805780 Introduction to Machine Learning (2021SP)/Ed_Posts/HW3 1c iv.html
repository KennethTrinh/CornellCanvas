 What does "how large is your bound on the expected generalization error" mean? For example, if my upper bound on the expected generalization error is 0.5, what do I say?

  You should show the work (algebra, value substitutions, etc.) that you used to arrive at the specific numeric value (not asking you to discuss whether you think this specific bound is relatively large for generalization error)

   so for this question, we just plug what we got form i and iii to the RHS and that is our upper bound? And thats how large our bound is on the expected generalization error?
