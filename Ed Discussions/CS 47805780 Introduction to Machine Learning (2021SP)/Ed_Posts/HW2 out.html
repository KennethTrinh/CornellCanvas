 Homework 2 is out. Updates and edits will be logged here.
</p>
<p>
 Please read the header and the questions carefully, and ask any questions/clarifications here on ed!
</p>
<p>
 Note that the due date is
 <b>
  Monday, March 8, 2021,
 </b>
 but because the Tues/Wed following are Cornell Wellness days, any late submission on Tues, Wed, or Thurs will count as having consumed one late day. To facilitate this logistically, the gradescope deadline is set to Wed 3/10. We encourage you to take the wellness days as just that and to take some deserved time off!
</p>
<p>
 Reminder: please form your groups on gradescope before submitting, and please mark where your solutions are on each page.

  To clarify, if we do submit Tuesday 3/9, will that count as using late days?

   Yes it will count as only one late day whether you turn it in on Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday.

   How does one form a group on Gradescope? We couldn't find anything in the course dashboard.
