 Are we able to write the answers on a separate sheet of paper and simply label the answers by the question number (1.1 for the first question in the calculus section, 2.1 for optimization, etc.)? Also, I do not think it is possible to click on the links that were supposed to be provided from the red, underlined words. Is it possible for us to obtain those links anywhere?

  Yes, you can write your answers on a separate sheet of paper as long as it's scanned cleanly and everything is clearly labelled.

   I think the links correspond to the ones in the "References" section
