  Should we consider the running time for constructing the emission table or are we assuming to be given one and just applying the Viterbi algorithm?

  Should we also consider the runtime of constructing the transition probabilities then? Are the emission probabilities and transition probabilities not just given?

  It asks to assume the model probabilities as constant time right. So, wouldn't that mean we're given a table with constant time ?

  I had the same question, especially since we need to know things like the number of times state a follows state b or output a is observed in state b, which we're not given. This is also what #1057 says
