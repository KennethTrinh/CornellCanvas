  Are quizzes always due on Wednesdays? I just tried to take the lecture 10 quiz and it says it was locked this morning at 10. I thought we had until Fridays to watch lectures and submit the quizzes?

  They are always due on Wednesday at 10am. There is only 1 exception for a lecture at the end of the semester. Don't worry though the lowest 4 quiz grades are dropped.
