  In recoverBias, I didn't understand the hint to express the equation in terms of alpha ? Should I find alpha from the equation and plugin the values computed from earlier ? I'm struck at this. Please give a hint on how to solve it.

  You should find the alpha that is furthest away from both $0$ and $C$, call it $\alpha_i$, to eventually get the most stable hyperplane bias. Then you take the $y_i$ corresponding to $\alpha_i$. Finally, you want to output bias, so use this information to solve for bias and have your function output that value.

  In the equation, for computing K(α_i, α), should we sum all the α_i, α_j where j goes from 1 to n ?
