 Maybe it could be another algorithm. I'm having so much trouble getting the output shapes right, that I don't even know if I'm doing it right at all. Am I supposed to output D_0... D_l in backprop?

  Yes that's it but I found it to be kind of unhelpful since what we have in the code is different...
  <break>
  </break>
  This is more like what it should be:
 </p>
 <p>
  for l in m-1,...,0
 </p>
 <math>
  \text{Gradient}_l=\frac{1}{n}\ \left(V_l^T\ \cdot D_{l+1}\right)
 </math>
 <math>
  D_l=\ \sigma'\left(S_l\right)\ \circ\ \left(D_{l+1}\cdot W_l^T\right)
 </math>
 <p>
  We were given the first delta value ($D_m$) in the function, and replace it with the updated $D_l$ in each iteration.
 </p>
 <p>
  ($\circ$ is element-wise multiplication)
 </p>
 <p>
  I waited in office hours for hours and it took me forever to figure this out so I hope this helps someone. I don't know how we were expected to figure this one out on our own.

   Does anybody know why we multiply by 1 / n for the gradient?

   <p>
    Is this what
    <code>
     delta
    </code>
    refers to? I don't really understand its construction...

     Yes in the code there is a variable called "delta", which is initialized with the first $D_m$ value that you need! Then you will reassign delta to the new value as computed the second equation I provided

      Thanks, this helped me out. Is there any reason why the first $D_m$ doesn't rely on $ \sigma'(s_{d, 1})$? I'm just curious, I got stuck for a while because this is what they put on the slides (and "delta" in the code seems to just calculate $\frac{\partial L}{\partial v_{d, 1}}$ over all the samples).

       The delta variable they gave us is already equivalent to $\sigma ' (s_{d,1})$ I think, but I could be wrong. I also am not sure I have a full understanding of the components

        isn't it because we are assuming the last activation function is f(x)=x, from a previous post, asking about why S_m=V_m

     I'm not sure if anyone else had this problem, but the type of multiplications I used were slightly different from the ones in the formula. In the step where you update D, I matrix multiplied D_{l+1} and W_l transpose, then I element-wise multiplied the result with sigma prime of S_l.

      Yes this is what I meant to convey, sorry if I caused confusion! I didn't know how to notate element-wise multiplication... I replaced the previous multiplication symbol with a $\circ$ to annotate element-wise multiplication
