 For the second problem, we can't actually give a numerical answer without knowing
 <i>
  ùõø,
 </i>
 correct? Should we calculate
 <i>
  |H|
 </i>
 or just give the expression below?
</p>
<p>
 <i>
  Consider the class of OR-functions over d binary (0/1 valued) features. How many examples are sufficient so that with probability at least 1-ùõø, only OR-functions of true error less than Œµ will have zero training error?

  Yep! This is correct, we leave it in terms of delta in this case.

   Thanks for the clarification. Would
   <i>
    |H|
   </i>
   be calculated using a sum of combinations? I thought the size of all possible
   <i>
    OR
   </i>
   functions would be something like:
  </p>
  <math>
   \left|H\right|=\left(\begin{matrix}d\\d\end{matrix}\right)+\left(\begin{matrix}d\\d-1\end{matrix}\right)+...+\left(\begin{matrix}d\\2\end{matrix}\right)
  </math>

    I would say that you can count H in a different way, that is, we are including it, including its opposite, or don't include it from h in terms of positive labeling, further this is applied bitwise.
