 I have a question about the derivation at the bottom of the slide.
</p>
<p>
 How did we get from the first line to the second line? (ie. how do we know that the difference given in the first line is upper bounded by the sum of the 3 differences, as written in the second line?)
</p>

  I'm pretty sure they're just equal to each other since all the inner terms cancel with each other.

   I understand they're equal, but I'm still not sure how we know they're equal

    Symbolically all you're doing is this: $$x - y = (x - z) + (z - w) + (w - y)$$ The $z$ and $w$ will cancel no matter what value you substitue in for them (in this case it's $z = err_{S}(h_{S})$ and $w = err_{S}(h^\star)$)
   </p>
