  You can start by copy+pasting your solution from (d) into the cell for (f) and try modifying it to change k and redo the classification when there is a draw. It is likely very similar to (d) with that small modification. Try not to change (d) so you don't accidentally mess up the autograder to complete an optional question.

  Should we name the function knnclassifier2 or something to avoid causing issues when it is called?
