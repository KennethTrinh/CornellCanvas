  For this question, I was unsure how to compute the size of the hypothesis class. Would it be something like 10*10*10 (since there are 3 nodes in the tree: root and 2 internal), and for each node, you can split on 10 features (or in the case of the internal node, 9 features or choose to put a leaf)?

  Does anyone know if the root node counts as an internal node?

  Here, will epsilon be 0.12 or 0.05?

  Epsilon would actually be 0.1 I think.

 <paragraph>
  This is because sample error is 24/1200 and prediction error is requested to be 0.12. Thus, |errs - errp| = |0.02 - 0.12| = 0.1
