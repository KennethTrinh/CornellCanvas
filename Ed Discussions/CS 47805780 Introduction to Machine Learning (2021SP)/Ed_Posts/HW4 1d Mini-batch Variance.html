  I think I have confused myself on what variance would be for the mini-batch update random variable. Is it true that if you take the batch size to be the whole dataset (m'=m, i.e.  you are doing just GD) that the variance would be 0?  Or can someone help me think about what variance means in this context?

  I have the same understanding that the variance would be 0 if the batch size is m. I think with each different m' the update would be a different random variable.
