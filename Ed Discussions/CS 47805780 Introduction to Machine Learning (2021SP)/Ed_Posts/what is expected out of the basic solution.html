  For the basic solution, do we need to create new features other than the normal encoding and one-hot-encoding and other processing ?

 <paragraph>
  I'm not sure if I'm proceeding in the right direction.

  I'm not sure what you mean by "normal encoding and one-hot-encoding and other processing".

  For feature processing, think about how you can represent the data such that it can be input into 2 machine learning algorithms of your choice. It is intentionally open-ended, so that you can choose how to represent the data in each column (such as date, year_week etc.) in a format conducive to your making your ML algorithm work. (Hint: think of how you could represent each row in the CSV as a numerical vector. Recall the last few lectures on feature normalisation: what issues may arise if the numerical ranges of features are wildly different?)

  I also strongly recommend reaching out to your final project mentor: we are here to help you out :) and offer advice!

 <blockquote>
  Roughly 75% of your grade will come from how well you craft a basic solution to the learning problem. You are required to do some kind of train and validation split for model selection and provide test-sample predictions for at least two machine learning algorithms from class. In more detail, this includes:
