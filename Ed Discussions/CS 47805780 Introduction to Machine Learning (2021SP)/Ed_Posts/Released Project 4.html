  Hello everyone,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Project 4: Deep Learning is now released on Vocareum and Canvas.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  This is an individual project. It is due next Friday, Apr 9th, and the last day to submit is on the following Tuesday, Apr 13th.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Before you start, it is really important to know that in P4, we use row vectors as feature vectors. This is different from the lecture slides, where you use column vectors for math derivation. Be careful with matrix operations and dimensional consistency!
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  FAQ will be listed below, this post will be kept updating until the project due.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Good luck and have fun!
