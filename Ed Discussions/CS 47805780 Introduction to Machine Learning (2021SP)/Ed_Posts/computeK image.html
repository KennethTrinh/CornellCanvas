 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 After implementing the computeK function, we are given an image to test our function. What does this image represent? What is it supposed to look like if our function is correct?
</p>
<p>
 Thanks!
</p>

  It's the kernel on the spiral data. You would expect a constant value (specifically 1) on the main diagonal.
