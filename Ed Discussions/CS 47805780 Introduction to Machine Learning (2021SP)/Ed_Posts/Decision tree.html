  While growing a decision tree, if we already use a feature in one branch, is it automatically eliminated from consideration from the other branches? I am getting a

  decision tree where I use up all the features but till dont get a Yes/No in 3.b.1

  Yes, the same feature could appear in separate branches (but some things to consider - is the tree still deterministic? is it consistent with the samples?)

  by deterministic, do you mean if it can accurately converge? My tree uses the same feature in diff branches, but it can converge properly and does not have conflicts. For example you split on feature A and for both children, you split on feature B. But then everything is different for all the children henceforth.

  By deterministic I meant that on one input you get only one label (i.e. can't trace multiple paths through the tree on same input).  And yes, if you split on feature A you can split on feature B on both of the children of that split.
