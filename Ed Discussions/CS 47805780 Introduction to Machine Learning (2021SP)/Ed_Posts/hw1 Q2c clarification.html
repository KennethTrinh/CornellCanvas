 When question 2c asks us to "list the coordinates (x, y) of each of these points," is it asking us to list all possible points/combinations of points that would change the classification of (2, 1), or just example points that would do so?

  You can just list the coordinates for an example set of points that constitute the minimum necessary to change the classification.
