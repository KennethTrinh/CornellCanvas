 I correctly implemented some of the functions for P4 and it says my correctness score is above 0 but my final score is 0/100. Any ideas on what could be going on and how I can get my final score to be the same as my correctness score?

  I had to implement the competition section to get any points, even if I got a 0% on the actual competition part.
