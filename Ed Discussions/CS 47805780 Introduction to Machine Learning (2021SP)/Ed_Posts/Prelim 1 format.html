 Will we only be able to see Prelim 1 questions on the lockdown browser when we open it? Are we not able to print the exam? I have found that it is helpful to have a paper copy of assignments/exams so that I can write on it, which helps me to think through the problems. Will this be possible on the actual prelim?
