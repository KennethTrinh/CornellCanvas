 Hey all,
</p>
<p>
 HW5 grades (for on-time submissions) are now out.
 <b>
  The stats below were calculated by assigning a default of 0
 </b>
 to currently ungraded assignments. It's the last assignment, and almost half the class are using up their slip days, so please take these with more than a grain of salt. Grades will continue to come in as we continue grading assignments.

 Regrade requests will be open for 1 week starting today. The solutions are available on Canvas. As always, if you submitted late, you will be allowed to submit regrade requests later.
</p>
<p>
 Please check Canvas for the solutions for prelim prep!

  I can't get access to the solutions, it says 'This shared file or folder link has been removed or is unavailable to you.'

    Err oops, thanks Christopher below -- I am not sure what went wrong, but I tried updating the link now. As he mentioned, all solutions are in the same Box folder, but hopefully this link works too.
