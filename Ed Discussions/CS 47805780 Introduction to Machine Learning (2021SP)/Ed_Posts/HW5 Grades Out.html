  Hey all,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  HW5 grades (for on-time submissions) are now out.
  <bold>
   The stats below were calculated by assigning a default of 0
  </bold>
  to currently ungraded assignments. It's the last assignment, and almost half the class are using up their slip days, so please take these with more than a grain of salt. Grades will continue to come in as we continue grading assignments.

  Err oops, thanks Christopher below -- I am not sure what went wrong, but I tried updating the link now. As he mentioned, all solutions are in the same Box folder, but hopefully this link works too.
