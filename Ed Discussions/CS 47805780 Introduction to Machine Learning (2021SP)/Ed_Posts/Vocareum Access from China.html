 I heard that some students have trouble paying for Vocareum access from China. Does anybody have advice for how to get around this most easily?

  A VPN might help. The best free VPN I know of the Windscribe. I managed to install Windscribe while in China with the Cornell VPN turned on. (It is also a phone app!)
