 What is the difference between generalization error, true error and test error of a hypothesis?
</p>
<p>
 Is generalization error the error in the entire dataset S? Test error the error in test set?
</p>
<p>
 Is true error the same as generalization error?
</p>

  True error, generalization error, and prediction error are the same, and refer to the expected value of a loss random variable, over the instance space of your feature space, the rv being your loss function.
 </p>
 <p>
  Test error is an estimate of the generalization error, since you haven't trained on that data.
