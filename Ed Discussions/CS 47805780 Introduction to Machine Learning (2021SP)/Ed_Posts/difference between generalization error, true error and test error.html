  True error, generalization error, and prediction error are the same, and refer to the expected value of a loss random variable, over the instance space of your feature space, the rv being your loss function.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Test error is an estimate of the generalization error, since you haven't trained on that data.
