 I believe Gradescope has a feature that lets you make groups for submitting assignments, like CMS. Right now we can't do this for HW 1, so should just one person in the group submit it?

  Only one person in the group needs to submit.

   Is there a way to use groups in the future? It would be nice for partners to view the submission and grade instead of depending on the partner to communicate the score.
