  I often have trouble hearing Professor Haghtalab's lectures properly even with my computer at max volume. Is it possible for her / her editor to turn her volume up a bit? It would make watching her lectures much easier, especially when I'm on campus with earbuds.

  I agree with this post, I have resorted to using external speakers to hear these lectures because the video's audio has low volume.

  I will say it depends what device I'm using, my over ear headphones are ok (albeit at high volume) while my wireless earbuds are not. I'm currently rewatching videos from L15.

  Unfortunately Professor Haghtalab is no longer at Cornell. I would suggest using the closed captions if you are unsure of what is being said. I will try and see if anything can be done about the volume.
