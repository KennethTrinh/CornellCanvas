 I often have trouble hearing Professor Haghtalab's lectures properly even with my computer at max volume. Is it possible for her / her editor to turn her volume up a bit? It would make watching her lectures much easier, especially when I'm on campus with earbuds.

  Could you please tell us which of the lecture videos have low volume?

   I will say it depends what device I'm using, my over ear headphones are ok (albeit at high volume) while my wireless earbuds are not. I'm currently rewatching videos from L15.

   I agree with this post, I have resorted to using external speakers to hear these lectures because the video's audio has low volume.

  Unfortunately Professor Haghtalab is no longer at Cornell. I would suggest using the closed captions if you are unsure of what is being said. I will try and see if anything can be done about the volume.
