 Hey Everyone,
</p>
<p>
 The survey is now closed, matchings will be sent out shortly. If you still need a partner please email me (bhg39@cornell.edu) and I will try to match you up during the week. Also please start thinking about forming groups for the final project as that is coming up soon. Thanks!
