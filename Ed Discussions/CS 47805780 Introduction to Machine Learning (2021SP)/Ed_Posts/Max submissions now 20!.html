 Hi everyone,
</p>
<p>
 We've upped the max number of Kaggle submissions for today to 20 to allow you an extra oomph before the deadline tonight. 20 is the cap determined by Kaggle so we cannot increase submissions any more than that. Think of it as the VC-Dim of the Kaggle submission hypothesis class...
</p>
<p>
 As a wise fictional wizard once said, "We're in the endgame now..."
</p>
<p>
 Best of luck, and finish strong!
