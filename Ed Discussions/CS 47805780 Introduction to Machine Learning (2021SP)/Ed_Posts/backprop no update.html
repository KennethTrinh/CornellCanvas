 I got rid of the dimension errors in backprop but now, no update takes place when i run the momentum code. The gradients are 0 and the loss function stays the same. Any advice on how to go from here?

  I wrote an equation more adapted to the code in #937 so I hope that helps?

  It's possible you are just returning the original weights instead of the updated gradient
