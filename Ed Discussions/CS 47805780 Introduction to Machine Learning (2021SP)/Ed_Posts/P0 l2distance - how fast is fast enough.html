 This is entirely out of curiosity, but I'm using the
 <code>
  l2distance
 </code>
 function I made in P0 for P1. The test in P0 showed it was about 10 times faster than the naive (numpy-less) implementation. What's expected? Is that within reason?

  It's expected that numpy computations should be
  <i>
   much
  </i>
  faster than the naive implementation. That being said, there could be a range of times based on your specific numpy implementation. 10x faster is a possibility, but you could also get numbers that would be over 1000x faster. As long as you used numpy somewhat efficiently, you shouldn't need to worry too much about it.
