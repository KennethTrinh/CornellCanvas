  Hi!
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  When we are calculating the running time, do we need to take into account the time that we construct the transition probabilities table and emission probabilities table? Since the question asks only "time to TAG a sentence," I would expect that we do not take into the time that we train a data set.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Besides, if we needed to take those into account, does "m words" mean m unique words, or the length of the training data set? That is, are we given an m-length sequence of text, or a literal dictionary of length m, where each entry is mapped to a POS.

  Thank you!

  You can assume the dictionary containing the transition/emission probabilities is already constructed. m refers to the number of unique words, n is the number of unique POSs, and T is the length of the sentence being tagged.
