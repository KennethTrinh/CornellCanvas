 Are we allowed to use submodules in NumPy on any of our projects? For example, I want to use numpy.linalg and some functions from this submodule in one of the questions for P1. Or should we be implementing things from scratch?

  Using NumPy functions should be fine - you should avoid any other packages that haven't been included in the starter code, though.
