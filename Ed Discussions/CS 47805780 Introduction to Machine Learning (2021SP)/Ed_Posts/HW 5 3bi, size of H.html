  I am a little confused as to the size of H for 3bi. Earlier in the course, we learned that the size of the instance space mapped to the possible outputs is the full extent of the hypothesis space. This would be a massive number in this case with 15 features that can take on 9 values and 2 possible outputs. Am I missing something as to how we should derive the size of H?

  You're on the right track. The number seems big, but it's actually not! A computer would be able to iterate through it just fine.

  The hypothesis class in this example is

   not
  </bold>
  equal in size to the full set of possible mappings from the instance space $X$ to the output space $Y$. In this question, the full set of hypotheses is restricted to linear classifiers with weights $w_{i} \in \{-2, -1, 0, 1, 2\}$. When calculating $|H|$ you should use this set and not the full set of possible mappings.
