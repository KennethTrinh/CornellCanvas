 What will the take-home Prelim 1 be like? Will it be open-book + open-notes? How long will it be (i.e. time limit, if any), and will the content/format of the questions be similar to the homeworks? Will there be any programming required? What is the best way to prepare for the prelim? Thank you!
</p>

  Prelim 1 will be timed and will resemble a written in-person exam as closely as possible. After all, the main purpose of Prelim 1 is to give you a preview of Prelim 2, and to give you a realistic assessment before the drop deadline. You will be able to use a single-sided cheat sheet. No programming. The best way to prepare is to make sure you really understand the homework and discussion sections, and drill into anything that you don't understand in the lectures. About a week before Prelim 1 I will also release some practice questions.
