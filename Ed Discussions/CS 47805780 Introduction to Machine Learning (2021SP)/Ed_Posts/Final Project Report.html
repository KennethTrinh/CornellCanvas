 Do we have to write the report in the notebook or can we write it in an overleaf doc and just submit that?

  That's okay, but we'd prefer it if you just filled in the answers in the indicated places! (just a lil' easier for grading)

  (EDIT: forgot that we can access your code through the ipynb upload -- sentiments about easy formatting still stand though!)
