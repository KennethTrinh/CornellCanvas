  I understand that going to discussions synchronously would be preferred, but currently I am not on campus, and I am unable to take the in-person sections. The online sections at 10:10AM on Wednesdays also conflict with one of my major requirements.

  Would the online discussions be recorded and/or work be able to be done asynchronously?

  Yes, each week a recording of the discussion section as well as the discussion handout will be posted on canvas.
