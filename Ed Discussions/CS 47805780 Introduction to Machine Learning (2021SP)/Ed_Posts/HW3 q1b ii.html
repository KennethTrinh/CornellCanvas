  For question 1b i we chose a weight vector that already has a norm of 1 so not sure how 1b ii is any different? Or should we use a different weight vector q1b i that doesn't have a norm of 1?

  In 1bi you need a weight vector corresponding to a functional margin of 1. It's a very special case when functional and geometric margins coincide. I don't think this is the case in this problem.

  To further elaborate:

 <paragraph>
  See if the functional margin is $1$ when your weight vector is normalized. If that is the case then you are in the clear. Otherwise, you need a weight vector and bias term that are indicative of a functional margin equal to $1$. The functional margin being $1$ and the weight vector being normalized can coincide but these events are not the same.
