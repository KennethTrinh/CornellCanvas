 The 1st and 3rd videos in Lecture 3 are very difficult to hear (Supervised Learning and Inductive Learning, Growing Decision Trees). The middle one seems to be fine. It is possible to follow along with them; they are just very quiet in comparison to the other videos.

  Yes we are aware and unfortunately cannot fix it at this time. I do know however that it does get better as the lectures progress.

   Thanks for letting us know! I'll make sure to pass the message along so it can be fixed for future lectures.
