 Q1: To find w and b so that hyperplane has a functional margin equal to 1,  Could I pick any point to scale w?
</p>
<p>
 Q2: I think I do not need to scale b, since if I scale b, the hyperplane will shift up or down resulting in misclassification. Am I correct?

  I am thinking that you can scale any point to scale w, although I am trying to understand what is the benefit of doing this.
 </p>
 <p>
  But for scaled b your w_2 factor should affect your b even if your w_1 is multiplied with an x_1 of 0, so, depending on scaling I think your b would also have to be scaled to keep the margin although I am not sure.

  Q1: Not 100% sure what you mean. You want to make sure the functional margin is 1. The margin is usually calculated as the distance between a line (defined by $\mathbf w, b$) and a few specific points. Not all points on the plane will have the same distance to the hyperplane!
 </p>
 <p>
  Q2: If I have an equation $\mathbf w \mathbf x = b$, then any point $\mathbf x$ on the line it represents will satisfy this equation. This is the definition of a line. If I scale $\mathbf 2$, say by some constant $c$, will the same set of points satisfy the equation?
 </p>
 <p>
  i.e.  $\mathbf w = (1,1), b = 1, c = 2$
 </p>
 <p>
  Line 1: $(1,1) \cdot \mathbf x = 1$
 </p>
 <p>
  Line 2: $2 (1,1)\cdot  \mathbf x = 1$
 </p>
 <p>
  Will every $\mathbf x$ that satisfies the first equation also satisfy the second, and vice versa? If so, then they represent the same line, and you do not need need to scale $b$.

   So, you mean find a functional margin that is 1 for all points or just the support vectors. If it's all points does that mean
   <b>
    w
   </b>
   and b should be functions of
   <b>
    x
   </b>
   ?

    The functional margin is defined as the smallest distance from a training point to the hyperplane. In other words, the distance from the plane to support vectors. There is no such thing as a "functional margin for all points".

    No, w and b should not be functions of x. (please follow up if it's not clear!)
