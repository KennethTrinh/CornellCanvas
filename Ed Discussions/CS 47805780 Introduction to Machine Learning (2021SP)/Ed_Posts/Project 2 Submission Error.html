  I submitted earlier today and it worked, but now when I submit my code I'm getting this error. Could this possibly be related to my own code or is this likely on the auto grader's end?

  Nvm. I resubmitted ~ 30 mins later and it passed. Resubmitting immediately didn't work, but waiting did. I'll leave the question here in case anyone else runs into the same issue.
