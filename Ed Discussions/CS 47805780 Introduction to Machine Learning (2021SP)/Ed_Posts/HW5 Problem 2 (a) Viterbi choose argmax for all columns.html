  I notice that in Gradescope it mentions we should "choose argmax for all columns". However, if we use backtracking that starts from the last column (right-most column) all the way through the first column (left-most column), we also get the same path as the "choosing argmax for all columns" path.

  I was wondering whether the
  <underline>
   backtracking
  </underline>
  path would
  <italic>
   always
  </italic>
  coincide with the path that chooses
  <underline>
   argmax
  </underline>
  for all columns?

  Not necessarily, since for example, whatever is in the argmax of column 2 might have really low-weight connections to everything in column 3, and therefore not be chosen as the previous node by any of the ones in column three. Always go for what backtracking chooses.
