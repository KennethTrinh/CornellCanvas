 I notice that in Gradescope it mentions we should "choose argmax for all columns". However, if we use backtracking that starts from the last column (right-most column) all the way through the first column (left-most column), we also get the same path as the "choosing argmax for all columns" path.
</p>
<p>
 I was wondering whether the
 <underline>
  backtracking
 </underline>
 path would
 <i>
  always
 </i>
 coincide with the path that chooses
 <underline>
  argmax
 </underline>
 for all columns?

  Not necessarily, since for example, whatever is in the argmax of column 2 might have really low-weight connections to everything in column 3, and therefore not be chosen as the previous node by any of the ones in column three. Always go for what backtracking chooses.
