 Hi all,
</p>
<p>
 With the exam coming up on Thursday, I've adjusted my schedule to hold office hours tomorrow morning,
 <b>
  Wednesday 09:00  - 11:00 (am).
 </b>
 Since I will be proctoring the exam Thursday evening, my normal Thursday office hours will not take place.  After this week (starting on Saturday) my OH schedule should be back to normal.
</p>
