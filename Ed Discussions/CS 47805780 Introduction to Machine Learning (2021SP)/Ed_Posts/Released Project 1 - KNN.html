 Good Luck!

  If I submitted the project now (without completing it) to check the parts I did, but am also planning to use a slip day and finish/resubmit the project on Saturday, will Canvas still be able to replace the grade that is in there right now (even if I resubmit after the Friday deadline)?

   How will projects be graded? Will they be manually graded based also on the quality of code (comments, cleanness, etc.), in addition to the number of test that they passed?

    It will not be manually graded. The scores you got on Vocareum is your project's final score.
