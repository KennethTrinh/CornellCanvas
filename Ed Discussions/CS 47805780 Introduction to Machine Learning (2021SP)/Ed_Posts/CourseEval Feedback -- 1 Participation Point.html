 The title says it all. We would really like to get your feedback via CourseEval, so please head over to
</p>
<list style="unordered">

 and complete the survey. To make it worth your time, I will give the 1 percentage point of participation credit to everybody who responds. The feedback is very valuable, since we are always working on improving the course. Thank you in advance!
