 Where did the number 1/(2^6) come from?

  I think this lecture was about guessing a 6 bit number. Guessing each bit has a probability of 1/2. Guessing 6 bits correctly has probability $1/(2^6)$. So, Pr[you are psychic | psychic power does not exist] = $1/(2^6)$.

   This is correct, although for framing the probability mentality it's better to think of this from a frequentist perspective (all numbers being equally likely to be chosen) than from a Bayesian one imo.
