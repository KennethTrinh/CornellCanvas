  I've been trying to modify my model
  <code>
   selectfeaturescomp
  </code>
  ,
  <code>
   extractfeaturescomp
  </code>
  , and
  <code>
   trainspamfiltercomp
  </code>
  for the past few days, and I haven't been able to beat the baseline. So far, I've tried changing the number of features, changing the maximum number of iterations, and changing the features I select.

  Try playing around with k and num_iters with a constant feature set and see if you're able to get better performance.

  K is the number of groups in k-fold cross validation, which was suggested in the notebook prior the the validation_split cell. It's not necessary but is very helpful for ensuring good performance.
