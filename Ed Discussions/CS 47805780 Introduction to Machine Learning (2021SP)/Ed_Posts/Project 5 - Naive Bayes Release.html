  Hello everyone,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Project 5: Naive Bayes is now released on Vocareum and Canvas.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  This is an individual project. It is due on next
  <bold>
   Friday, Apr 22nd
  </bold>
  , and the late deadline is on
  <bold>
   Apr 30th
  </bold>
  . However, since there are wellness days following the 22nd, we have decided that you can submit with no late penalty from
  <bold>
   Apr 23rd - 26th
  </bold>
  (for logistical reasons, we cannot make the project due Apr 26th since this is a Wellness day).
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  FAQ will be listed below, we will keep updating this post until the project due.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Also as a PSA about Project 4, any manual regrading that should have happened has happened, and we are asking you to double check that your recorded score corresponds to your true score (contact us via a private post if something went wrong).
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Good luck and have fun!
