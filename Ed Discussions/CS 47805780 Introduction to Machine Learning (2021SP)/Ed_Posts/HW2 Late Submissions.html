  Hello all,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Because HW2's header did not specify the last day for homework late submissions, we'll be accepting them until
  <bold>
   tomorrow, Wed 3/17 at 5pm.
  </bold>
  Note that the slip day counting as described in HW2 is still in place, to account for the wellness days (handing it in tomorrow would cost 7 slip days).
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Solutions will be released tomorrow, and you will have 1 week to submit regrade requests starting then.
