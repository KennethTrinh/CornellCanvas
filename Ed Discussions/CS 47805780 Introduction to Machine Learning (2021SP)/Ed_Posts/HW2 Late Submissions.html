 Hello all,
</p>
<p>
 Because HW2's header did not specify the last day for homework late submissions, we'll be accepting them until
 <b>
  tomorrow, Wed 3/17 at 5pm.
 </b>
 Note that the slip day counting as described in HW2 is still in place, to account for the wellness days (handing it in tomorrow would cost 7 slip days).
</p>
<p>
 Solutions will be released tomorrow, and you will have 1 week to submit regrade requests starting then.
