  I am confused about the order we go through training examples in perceptron. Here are the two ways I am thinking of:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <break>
  </break>
  1) Go through list of examples in order until you find one that is misclassified. Update w and go back to the beginning of the list.

  2) Go through list of examples until you find an example that is misclassified. Update w and continue going through the examples from where you left off until you go through all examples. Then go from the start of the list again.

  The responses to
  <link href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/4342/discussion/304340"/>
  #352 and
  <link href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/4342/discussion/293627"/>
  #273 suggest (1), while the instructor response to
  <link href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/4342/discussion/306000"/>
  #357 suggests (2). Which is it? Are both methods equally effective?
