 I am confused about the order we go through training examples in perceptron. Here are the two ways I am thinking of:
</p>
<p>
 <break>
 </break>
 1) Go through list of examples in order until you find one that is misclassified. Update w and go back to the beginning of the list.
</p>
<p>
 2) Go through list of examples until you find an example that is misclassified. Update w and continue going through the examples from where you left off until you go through all examples. Then go from the start of the list again.

  and

  #273 suggest (1), while the instructor response to
  <link href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/4342/discussion/306000"/>
  #357
 </a>
 suggests (2). Which is it? Are both methods equally effective?
