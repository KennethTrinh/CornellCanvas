  It becomes &lt;= once you substitute zero for the middle term. We do this to get an upper bound that we can compute.

  Note that the training error of the hypothesis that minimizes the training error is often lower than the training error of the hypothesis that has the best prediction error - especially if the prediction error is greater than zero. For example, the best prediction error may be 10% and this hypothesis makes a few training errors. But then there could be another hypothesis that overfits the training data and makes no training errors, even if that hypothesis has worse prediction error.
