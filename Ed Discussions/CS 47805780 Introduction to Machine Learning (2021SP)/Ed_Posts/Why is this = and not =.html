 Don't all intermediate terms cancel out?

  It becomes &lt;= once you substitute zero for the middle term. We do this to get an upper bound that we can compute.

 <p>
  Note that the training error of the hypothesis that minimizes the training error is often lower than the training error of the hypothesis that has the best prediction error - especially if the prediction error is greater than zero. For example, the best prediction error may be 10% and this hypothesis makes a few training errors. But then there could be another hypothesis that overfits the training data and makes no training errors, even if that hypothesis has worse prediction error.
