 discussion post, we check from the beginning of the dataset after an update on $w$. However, this conflicts with the batch perceptron algorithm presented in lecture 9 (as attached). Here, in each epoch, we go through all the samples, even if we have performed an update on $w$. Given that the final output of a perceptron is dependent on update order, which one should we be using for hw/exams?

  The post and the screen shot are actually saying the same thing. "REPEAT UNTIL" is actually a while loop. Everytime we change w, we go through the "FOR i=1 to m" again
