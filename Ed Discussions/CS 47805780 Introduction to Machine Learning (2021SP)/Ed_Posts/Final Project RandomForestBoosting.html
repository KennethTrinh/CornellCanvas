  Our group decided to use boosting as the second algorithm we learned in class for the first part of the final project. While working with different boosting algorithms sklearn provided, the Random Forest Boosting turns out to work the best for us. Are we allowed to use this algorithm even though we didn't learn this specific algorithm in the boosting module?
