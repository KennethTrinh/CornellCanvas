 I completely understand why there is a upper bound that is |H|2exp(-m*epsilon^2/2)
</p>
<p>
 But this is just a larger upper bound.
</p>
<p>
 My question is why can't we use Hoeffding's inequality directly for the |err_s(hs)-err_p(hs)&gt;epsilon/2|;
</p>
<p>
 proceeding from the first to the second equation is simply stating the fact the "hs has large error" is the subset of the event "one of the h has a large error" . when we are doing sum in the third eqns, hs is also there
</p>
<p>
 proceeding from 3th to 4th we also directly use hoeffding inequality on hs.
</p>
<p>
 So I don't see why use hoeffding inequality on hs on the first eq is wrong. Why this smaller upper bound is wrong?

  From the wiki:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  In
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory">
   probability theory
   ,
   <b>
    Hoeffding's inequality
   </b>
   provides an
   <link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_bound"/>
   upper bound on the
   <link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"/>
   probability that the sum of bounded
   <link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_random_variables"/>
   independent random variables deviates from its
   <link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value"/>
   expected value
  </a>
  by more than a certain amount.
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  And we also have that: $$err_{S}(\hat{h}) = \frac{1}{m}\Sigma_{i=0}^{m}\Delta(y_{i}, \hat{h}(x_{i}))$$
 </p>
 <p>
  So, $err_{S}(\hat{h})$ is a sum of bounded independent random variables so long as $\Delta(y_{i}, \hat{h}(x_{i}))$ is an
  <b>
   independent RV
  </b>
  . But, the $h_{S}$ that you get after doing ERM is
  <i>
   using
  </i>
  this loss function to choose the best hypothesis on the data. So, once you've picked the $h_{S}$ by minimizing the loss function, you've removed the randomness from the equation, breaking one of the assumptions needed for the Hoeffding inequality.
