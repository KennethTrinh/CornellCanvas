 What does "How much did you manage to improve performance on the test set" mean? Is this just asking for the final test error that we received on Kaggle? Is it asking for the difference between our first and our best submission on Kaggle? Or something else?

  That's probably a legacy question from last semester's final project, when the metrics for baseline and creative were both accuracy. In this case, you should be fine just uploading the final test error you received.
