  Hi! In my experience your current place on waitlists is irrelevant for CS classes (it is important in other fields though). The CS department runs their algos and determines the order themselves (see here:
  <link href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courseinfo/enrollment"/>
  CS Enrollment Information | Department of Computer Science (cornell.edu)   and here:
  <link href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courseinfo/enrollment/cs-waitlist-faqs"/>
  CS waitlist FAQs | Department of Computer Science (cornell.edu) ). I think they usually roll out pin codes in batches, so the longer you've been waiting the smaller the probability that you will get a place in the end.
