  Sorry a bit confused by the question, a pdf or probability distribution function, describes for a particular input its probability in the sample space. The likelihood function is explicitly p(y|x.theta) where you're trying to optimize for theta that maximizes this quantity.

  I mean for the question on pg 6, can we consider f(x) to be the probability P(x|theta)? In that case I am getting the same answer as the problem on pg 12 discussed in the review session except for lambda in place of theta. Is that correct?
