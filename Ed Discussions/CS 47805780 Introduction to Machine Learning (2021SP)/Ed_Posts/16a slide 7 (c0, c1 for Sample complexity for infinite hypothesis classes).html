 Why is there c_0 and c_1 instead of 1, 2, as for finite hypothesis classes? I thought |H| was simply being replaced with the growth function.

  There is an additional constant term for each that came up in the algebra, and they're being replaced by c_0 and c_1 because their exact value isn't particularly importantâ€“rather this is to show how m grows relative to the other values.

   I think there is also a typo in the sample complexity (general case), ln(1/delta) should be ln(2/delta).
