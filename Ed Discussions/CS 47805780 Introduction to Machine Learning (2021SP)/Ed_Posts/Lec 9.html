 don't understand why the question can be transformed to finding min max of Lagrange multipliers, is there material that I can read about this? the textbook doesn't get a reason why.

  You can think of the lagrange multipliers as variables that indicate constraints to the problem. At the end of the day, we want to classify the points using a separating hyperplane in such a way that as few as possible constraints are violated.
 </p>
 <p>
  By setting the different lagrange multipliers to values greater than or equal to $0$, we are saying two things:
 </p>
 <p>
  1) If a training example is classified correctly and doesn't affect the hyperplane then the lagrange multiplier for that point is 0 because that is the expectation.
 </p>
 <p>
  2) If a training example is a support vector, then a constraint is violated and the loss function should invoke a penalty by adding to the loss (this is done by giving value to the lagrange multiplier associated with that training example).
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, we see why there are lagrange multipliers. To see why we take the min max, think of it in this way: Let $OPT$ be the optimal value of the problem of minimizing the primal. The Lagrangian dual function has the property that it will always be less tha $OPT$. It is a lower bound on the primal function. Instead of solving the primal problem, we are want to get the maximum lower bound on $OPT$ by maximizing the Lagrangian dual function. Then we take the min over all $w$ just like we did in the primal.
