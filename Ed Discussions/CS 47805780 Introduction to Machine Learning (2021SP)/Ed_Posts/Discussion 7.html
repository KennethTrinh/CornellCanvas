 I'm super confused about VC dimension, hypothesis space, and sauer's lemma. I feel like question 2 was asking us to determine the hypothesis space for 4 points. We showed for a) that we could do 2^4. But then we go to question 3 and we show the VC dimension is 4, but sauer's lemma is saying that we can only split the same points we just split at most m^d. So putting these two questions together, we're saying that for the four points in this example that we can shatter we have a hypothesis space of 2^4, but if we add any more points (like one more point to make 5) then sauer's lemma is saying we can have at most 5^4 splits because we can't shatter 2^5 since our VC dimension is 4 (at least for axis aligned rectangles?)
