 I just want to make sure I'm understanding this correctly.

 Training errors are already misclassified to begin with, so do we consider training errors to always be leave-one-out errors because, since they started as misclassified to begin with, if we take that training error example out, and the decision boundary shifts, that example would

  still
 </i>
 be misclassified?
