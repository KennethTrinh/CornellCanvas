  At the end of lecture 15e, we conclude:

  However, the general sample complexity theorem is stated as:

 <paragraph>
  It seems to me that the general sample complexity theory says "the probability that the difference between the true and sample errors of a hypothesis is big is less than $2|H|e^{-\epsilon^2 m / 2}$." This seems pretty different from what we wanted to prove -- that the difference between $h_s = argmin(err_S(h_i))$ and $h^* = argmin(err_P(h_i))$ is probably small.

 <paragraph>
  How are these two statements related?

  We know that if $err_{s}(h_{s})$ - $err_{p}(h_{s})$ $\leq$ $\epsilon /2$, and $err_{s}(h^{*})$ - $err_{p}(h^{*})$ $\leq$ $\epsilon /2$, then $err_{p}(h_{s})$ - $err_{p}(h^{*})$ $\leq$ $\epsilon$ (see the 2 slides before).
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  When $err_{s}(h_{s})$ - $err_{p}(h_{s})$ $&gt;$ $\epsilon /2$, then we know the conditions in the previous sentence are false, and the probability of that happening is upper bounded by Pr($err_{s}(h_{s})$ - $err_{p}(h_{s})$ $&gt;$ $\epsilon /2$), which is itself upper bounded by Hoeffding inequality on the RHS.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  So we know that RHS bounds  Pr($err_{p}(h_{s})$ - $err_{p}(h^{*})$ $&gt;$ $\epsilon$), i.e. the probability that the difference between $err_{p}(h_{s})$ and $err_{p}(h^{*})$ is large is small.
