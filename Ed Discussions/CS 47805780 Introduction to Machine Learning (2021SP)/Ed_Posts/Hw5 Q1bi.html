 In the problem statement for 1bi it says to show the values of
</p>
<math>
 \left(P\left(Y=y\right|X=x\right)
</math>
<p>
 for both classes, but I'm honestly not sure how this is relevant since the decision rule for the naive Bayes classifier is

  Ah ok I see, well just from an intuition standpoint we're given an x point to classify, so we want to find the probability that it is either of the classes and predict the class with the largest probability. That aligns more with the conditional probability of P(Y=y|X=x) which is the probability of Y=y given x.

   So do we need to calculate  P(Y=y|X=x) or can we just calculate P(Y=y, X=x) like in the lecture slides?

   There's 2 classes: +1,-1. The chosen x point is the same, the only thing you're changing in the decision rule is the y (either +1 or -1). Substitute into the expression x and one y at a time, and compute the argmax of those expressions (choose between +1/-1). Does this clarify it?

    I thought we would have P(X=x|Y=y), not this way?
