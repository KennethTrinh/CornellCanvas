 It seems that the rows and columns of Table 2 (Emission Probabilities) of Problem 2 of HW 5 are flipped, which does not make sense to me. Is it the case?

  It looks like the descriptions of the rows and columns were flipped, where the row should be the word (x) and the column the pos tag (y).

   This would be an easy fix, but I just want to double-check. In Table 1, the rows are the r.v.'s that we condition on (which is more commonly used), while Table 2 are the columns. They follow quite different conventions.

    The HMM model assumes that the POS tag is generated first (based on the previous tag) and the words are selected randomly based on the chosen POS tag. Does that clear things up?
