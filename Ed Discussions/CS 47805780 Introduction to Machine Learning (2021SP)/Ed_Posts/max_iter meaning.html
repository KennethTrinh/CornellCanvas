<p>
 in the cell below def perceptron I got AsertionError: yw'x should be +1 for every input
</p>
<p>
 I think the iteration run too few times so it did not cover all vectors so some of them still misclassified
</p>
<p>
 if I iterate only 100 times on the 100 vectors randomly, it is not possible to cover every vector , resulting in the assertion error
</p>
<p>
 what does max_iter means in here?  how should I do the iteration?
</p>

  My understanding was that an iteration meant going through all the vectors until you hit a vector you misclassified. Then you adjust
  <code>
   w
  </code>
  , shuffle the order of the vectors, and start the second iteration with the adjusted w and new order of training data.

   I did this, but I think the original commenter is right. Sometimes if the shuffles are good I get a consistent classifier and I pass the assertion. Other times the shuffles result in some vectors still being misclassified by the end of the 100 iterations. Are we sure this is the correct interpretation?
