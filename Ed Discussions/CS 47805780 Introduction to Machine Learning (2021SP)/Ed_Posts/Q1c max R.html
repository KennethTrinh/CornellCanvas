  I'm not sure where to start on this problem. It looks like we're trying to maximize the length of the feature vector (i.e. the size of
  <bold>
   x
  </bold>
  for each instance?). But aren't we already told that each instance has a length of 100,000? How can we say it's less than 10?

  The length of a feature vector is the Euclidean distance between the point represented by the vector and the origin (in the 100,000-dimension coordinate system)
