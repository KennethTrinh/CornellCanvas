 What exactly is the mean and standard deviation we are using when we are scaling the data set? For example if the data set is 2D, would the mean be the vector [ (mean of x1's),   (mean of x2's)]
</p>
<p>
 and the standard deviation be  [ (stdev of x1's),   (stdev of x2's)]?

  Yes, actually, you can dig a little deeper into how mean and std are calculated in NumPy, and calculate these vectors just like scalers.
