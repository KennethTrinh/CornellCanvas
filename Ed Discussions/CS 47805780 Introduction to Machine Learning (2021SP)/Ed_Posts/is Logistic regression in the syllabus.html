  In general, I would not conclude that something will not be tested, just because it does not show up in a heading on the answer sheet. For example, we could be Kernelizing logistic regression, and then it comes up under Kernels. Well, I wont ask you that particular question since it is quite a lot of algebra, but you get the idea.
