  I think we skimmed over this in the lecture but what exactly is No Free lunch theorem. Also what does A(S) mean in this case? I thought A(S) was the hypothesis but h is the hypothesis...

  I believe
  <italic>
   A(S)
  </italic>
  is algorithm
  <italic>
   A
  </italic>
  trained on sample set
  <italic>
   S
  </italic>
  . Any hypotheses
  <italic>
   h
  </italic>
  estimating the target function
  <italic>
   f
  </italic>
  could be expressed this way.

  The No Free Lunch refers to the fact that ability of an algorithm to express a mapping comes at the "price" of increased risk of overfitting.

  This is from UML the reference text. My question is why are we limiting the training size to |X|/2(half of the instance space?)?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If the training size exceeds |X|/2, would the general conclusion 'no learner can succeed on all learning tasks' become true?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Is the theorem an emphasis on the training sample size? Or a general conclusion regarding all learners?

  A is a learning algorithm, A(S) is the output of that algorithm trained on a set S (i.e. a classifier), and h is a different, more accurate hypothesis.
