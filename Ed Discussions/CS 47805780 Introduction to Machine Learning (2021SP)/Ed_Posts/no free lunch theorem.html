 I think we skimmed over this in the lecture but what exactly is No Free lunch theorem. Also what does A(S) mean in this case? I thought A(S) was the hypothesis but h is the hypothesis...

  This is from UML the reference text. My question is why are we limiting the training size to |X|/2(half of the instance space?)?
 </p>
 <p>
  If the training size exceeds |X|/2, would the general conclusion 'no learner can succeed on all learning tasks' become true?
 </p>
 <p>
  Is the theorem an emphasis on the training sample size? Or a general conclusion regarding all learners?

   I believe
   <i>
    A(S)
   </i>
   is algorithm
   <i>
    A
   </i>
   trained on sample set
   <i>
    S
   </i>
   . Any hypotheses
   <i>
    h
   </i>
   estimating the target function
   <i>
    f
   </i>
   could be expressed this way.
  </p>
  <p>
   The No Free Lunch refers to the fact that ability of an algorithm to express a mapping comes at the "price" of increased risk of overfitting.

  A is a learning algorithm, A(S) is the output of that algorithm trained on a set S (i.e. a classifier), and h is a different, more accurate hypothesis.
