 What exactly is the following variable supposed to be used for in the starter code for backprop?
</p>
<p>
 <code>
  delta = (V[-1].flatten() - yTr.flatten()).reshape(-1, 1)
 </code>
</p>
<p>
 I thought the delta matrix was supposed to be built from chaining derivatives together.

  It helps you to calculate the gradient of loss. You can then do back prop based on that.
