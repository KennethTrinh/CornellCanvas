  I am having strange issues with the polynomial kernel. When I first try to implement the formula given, I apply a transpose on X as instructed. This produced a strange image where each of the four quadrants was one solid color, and did not pass the test cases in vocareum. However, when I transpose Z instead (all else remaining the same) it passes the test cases and produces a different image, where each quadrant has diagonal lines getting brighter as the axes increase. Any thoughts?

  I had the same experience, the solution was to transpose the Z matrix. Not sure if this was the correct approach because the instructions clearly say to transpose X, but it does pass the test case.
