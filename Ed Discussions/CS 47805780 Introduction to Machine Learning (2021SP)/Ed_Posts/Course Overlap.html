 I am currently enrolled in this course and ORIE 4740 - Statistical Data Mining. I noticed some overlap in the course content between the two classes, as they both cover topics such as Regression, Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, and Decision Trees. Does anyone know if enrolling in both of these courses is a bad idea due to excessive overlap? Any guidance would be appreciated.
