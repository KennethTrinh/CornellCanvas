 #749 mentions that we should flip the filter first, before doing the cross-correlation, but the idea of flipping the filter was never mentioned in the lectures. Should we flip the filter? If so, what do we assume to be the origin of the filter to flip it over?

  Flipping the filter is something that's done in practice in computer vision. In this class, you do not need to flip the filter.
