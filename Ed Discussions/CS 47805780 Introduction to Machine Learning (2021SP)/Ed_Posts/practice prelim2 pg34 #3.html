 Is the VC dimension of this hypothesis space H infinite ? If not, what would be a counterexample of a set of points that could not be shattered by H?

  It is not infinite. H is the set of circles, but each individual hypothesis is just one circle. So, you want to shatter a set of d points using only 1 circle (but you can put the circle wherever you want and make it as big as you want).

   I've been struggling with the exact definition of the VC dimension... in the instance of the XOR function with 4 points, a circle would not be able to shatter S. Does that mean the VC dimension of this hypothesis class is &lt;4? There are other examples of 4 points that
   <i>
    can
   </i>
   be shattered, so I'm not sure if that means the VC dim is at least 4 or not.

    Are there examples of 4 points that can be shattered? To shatter a set S means to be able to represent all possible labellings of set S with a hypothesis from H. All of H are circles, so to shatter a set of 1 point looks like this:

    To shatter 2 points with H, I need to look at 2^2 labellings, and it looks like this:

    And shattering 3 points is also doable. I haven't drawn out all 8 cases, but you can see some of them:

    Recall that for a VC dimension to be d:
   </p>
   <p>
    1.
    <b>
     There exists
    </b>
    at least 1 set of size d that is shatterable -- i.e.
    <b>
     for all
    </b>
    2^d labellings of this set, I can represent them using hypotheses from H.
   </p>
   <p>
    2.
    <b>
     For all
    </b>
    sets of size d+1 and above, there is no way to shatter them. i.e.
    <b>
     there exists
    </b>
    at least one labelling of these d+1 or more points that can't be captured from H.
   </p>
   <p>
    Typically point 2. above is harder to prove.
   </p>
   <p>
    Note: if there exists a set of size d or below that is not shatterable, such as 3 colinear lines with the circle, it does not preclude point 1. In other words, the VC dimension is at least 3 even if there is only 1 very specific very ideal set of 3 points shatterable by H.

     So would it not be possible for this hypothesis class to shatter a set of 4 points? I was thinking about it, and I think it can't, but just wanted to make sure
