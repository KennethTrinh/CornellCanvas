  The equation that we are given to invert to find the b parameter of the hyperplane in P3 is
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  yi (∑αi yi k(xi,x) + b)=1
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  There are two different indices i being referred to - am I correct in understanding that a less ambiguous form of the equation is
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  yi (∑αj yj k(xi,xj) + b)=1 ?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Another question: are we allowed to use a for loop for this sum? I understand how to get a sum over two terms (an inner product) but I'm a little confused as to how to get a sum over the three terms here.

  Yes, a more clear equation would be yi (∑αj yj k(xj,x) + b)=1. As for computing the sum, numpy allows for the element wise multiplication of arrays which could then be summed over using numpy functions rather than using for loops.

  What is the term k(xj, x)? As in what exactly is x here?
