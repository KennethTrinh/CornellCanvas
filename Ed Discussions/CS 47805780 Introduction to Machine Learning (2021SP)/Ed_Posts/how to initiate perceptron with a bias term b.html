  We have been working with initiating a perceptron with a homogeneous w with b =0. If we are to add b into consideration, what should its initial value be?

  $b$'s initial value would likely also be 0 (although really it could be anything you choose). Using our algorithm, you could find $b$ by adding an additional feature to the end of $w$ and 1's to the end of each $x$ instance.
