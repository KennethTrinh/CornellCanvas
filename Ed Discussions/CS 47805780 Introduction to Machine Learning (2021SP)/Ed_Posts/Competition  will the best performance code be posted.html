  Dear TAs,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I suppose that 97% baseline was set because it is something easily achievable once we know a certain trick... I somehow managed to barely get it, but I still wonder if I could do this in a much easier way...
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Will you post, at least, the pseudo-code by one of TAs or by the competition winner?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thank you!

  Sincerely,

  Our current policy surrounding project solutions is to not release code. If you want more information regarding said pseudocode and the approach, please come to office hours and speak with a TA!
