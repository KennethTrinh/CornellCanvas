 Since we are deep into the final projects now and don't have pre-recorded lectures with new material coming out any more, we will not have regular discussion sections this week or next week. Instead, we have the following two live lectures:
</p>
<list style="bullet">
 <li>
  <p>
   Wednesday 5/5 at 10:10am: Privacy and Machine Learning
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Wednesday 5/12 at 10:10am: Fairness and Machine Learning
  </p>
 </li>
</list>
<p>
 You can attend these lectures via
</p>
<list style="bullet">
 <li>
  <p>
   https://cornell.zoom.us/j/94908400712?pwd=NWJvU1g1QVYvSmt2SlZWWFBsd3J4QT09
  </p>
 </li>
</list>
<p>
 no matter which discussion section you are enrolled in. If you have a conflict, we will make a recording available for you to catch up.
</p>
<p>
 Clearly, those two topics will not be relevant for the exam, but they are
 <b>
  very
 </b>
 relevant to any work you will do with machine learning. So, I hope to see you there.

  I am interested in the topics of 'interpretability' and 'accountability' in ML that were mentioned in the lecture. Is there any good literature on this topic that you could point me to?
