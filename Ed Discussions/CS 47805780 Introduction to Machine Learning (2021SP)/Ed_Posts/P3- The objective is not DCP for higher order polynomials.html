 I'm having trouble getting the objective to follow DCP rules when using the polynomial kernel for a degree higher than 2. I think my polynomial kernel is fine since I can separate the spiral data with a parabola when setting kerneltype = "poly" and kpar = 2. However, when I set kpar = 3 or higher (to be able to separate the data with higher degree polynomials), I keep getting that the "objective is not DCP". Is there any reason why this might be the case?
</p>
<p>
 The radial basis function and linear kernels are fine as well since I've finished the main part of the project- I would just like to try to use the polynomial kernel with higher degrees for the competition. Earlier in the project, I was also getting errors that the objective was "not DCP" when trying to separate the spiral data, until I used the quad_form atom like suggested on a previous post.
</p>
<p>
 Does raising the data to polynomials larger than 2 suddenly make the objective not concave anymore (since we're trying to maximize the dual)? Or could it just be that CVXPY package is acting buggy? I normally wouldn't ask but I've been trying to debug for a while and it's getting pretty frustrating. Thanks.

  I'm also having the same issue. I'm getting high error rates for linear and RBF kernels on the competition, so I'm trying to use higher degree polynomials but I can't stop getting DCP errors. Any updates on this issue?

   I ended up using SCS solver instead of ECOS for polynomial. I am not sure if this was something we were allowed to do but it worked for me.

   Also I only tried integer values for polynomial to avoid accidentally square-rooting negative values (although I am not sure if there was a smarter way. to go about this)
