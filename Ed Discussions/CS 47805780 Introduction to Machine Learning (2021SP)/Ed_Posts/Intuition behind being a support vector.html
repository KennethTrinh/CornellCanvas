 In lecture 9 it is mentioned that a point is a support vector iff $\alpha_i^* &gt; 0$. Is there an intuitive way to justify this? I found something that derives this using the Kuhn-Tucker conditions but I don't understand the intuition behind those either.

  Note that the definition of a support vector is a point in the dataset that directly influences the hyperplane.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the $\alpha_i$ of a point is greater than $0$ it plays a roll in determining the value of our loss function. Thus, it has influence on the hyperplane we found and is therefore a support vector. To see the other direction, if something does directly influence the hyperplane then it plays a roll in determining the value of our loss function. This is only the case for a given point if its $\alpha_i$ is greater than $0$. We have seen both direction of the implication. Let me know if there are further questions :).
