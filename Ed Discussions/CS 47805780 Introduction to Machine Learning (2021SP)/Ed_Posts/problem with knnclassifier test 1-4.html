  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I can execute the following with k=1,2,...5, but knnclassifier test 1-4 always fail. What is the problem? Is it anything wrong with my code?

 <pre>analyze("acc",yTe,knnclassifier(xTr,yTr,xTe,k))</pre>

  In your knn classifier function, try changing your preds in to a np array and then flatten it.

  I had the same problem and flattening preds fixed it, but, out of curiosity, why exactly is this problem happening? Seems really weird and I would've never thought of doing this on my own.
