  In
  <code>
   recoverBias
  </code>
  , there is the term $k(x_i,x)$ in $h(x)$. Although we have
  <code>
   K
  </code>
  as an input, I believe it only contains the result of kernel operations on existing data points since it is an $n*n$ matrix. How can we get the kernel result on a new data point $x$?

  You would need access to the kernel function to apply to the new data point x; however, it is not needed to compute any additional kernels to complete recoverBias
