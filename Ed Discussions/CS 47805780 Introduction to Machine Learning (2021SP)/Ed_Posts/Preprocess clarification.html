 I was confused by the preprocess function and what we're expected to return for the mean and standard deviation. Are we expected to return a single number or some sort of array/matrix?

  I returned a scalar for the preprocess function but an array of length d for the competition and got full points. Not sure why they are different, but hope that helps.

  I think we're supposed to calculate the mean and standard deviation for each feature, so the output should be an array for each.
 </p>
 <p>
  The way I think of it, xTr is a matrix nxd, so for each of the d features we want the mean and standard deviation.
