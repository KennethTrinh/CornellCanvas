 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 I am very interested in taking this course this semester in order to complete my CS minor requirements. I am taking a probability and statistics course at the same time as this class. I've been a bit discouraged after seeing the pre-test, but I was wondering if there were students in the past that had taken Probability and Statistics concurrently with this course and how they fared?
</p>
<p>
 Thanks.
</p>

  There have been students in the past who have done this (I personally know a few in addition to myself) and have done just fine. It honestly depends on the individual, workload of other classes, etc. I don't believe that taking this class concurrently with statistics is a recipe for disaster or anything on its own. Don't get too discouraged by the prerequisite exam; that said, the pre-test is still supposed to somewhat reflect how difficult this class will be, based on what knowledge is lacking/needs to be refreshed.
