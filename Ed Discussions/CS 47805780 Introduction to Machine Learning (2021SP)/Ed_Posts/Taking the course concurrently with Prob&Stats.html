  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I am very interested in taking this course this semester in order to complete my CS minor requirements. I am taking a probability and statistics course at the same time as this class. I've been a bit discouraged after seeing the pre-test, but I was wondering if there were students in the past that had taken Probability and Statistics concurrently with this course and how they fared?

  Thanks.

  There have been students in the past who have done this (I personally know a few in addition to myself) and have done just fine. It honestly depends on the individual, workload of other classes, etc. I don't believe that taking this class concurrently with statistics is a recipe for disaster or anything on its own. Don't get too discouraged by the prerequisite exam; that said, the pre-test is still supposed to somewhat reflect how difficult this class will be, based on what knowledge is lacking/needs to be refreshed.
