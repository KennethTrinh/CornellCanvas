  I find both of them very similar. I realise that the first case is for non-realisable sample complexity, but the second case seems mysteriously similar to the first case. Any hints on how to differentiate between the two are appreciated.

  In part (i), we are evaluating a hypothesis that was trained on some sample. In part (ii), we are evaluating a hypothesis that has

  . This distinction is important for determining how to solve each part (why did we even need to derive the equations in Lecture 15?).
