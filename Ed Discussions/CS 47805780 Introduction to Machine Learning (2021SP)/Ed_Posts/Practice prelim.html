  When would we want to use soft-margin SVM over batch Perceptron (also what does batch Perceptron mean? is it not the same as perceptron?)

  Batch perceptron refers to the perceptron that has all the data available to it at once in a "batch" whereas online perceptron refers to getting one data point at a time as if you were just loading data from "online". And that example is a correct instance yes.
