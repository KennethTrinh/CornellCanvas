 When would we want to use soft-margin SVM over batch Perceptron (also what does batch Perceptron mean? is it not the same as perceptron?)
</p>
<p>
 Is an example when the data is not linearly seperable?

  Batch perceptron refers to the perceptron that has all the data available to it at once in a "batch" whereas online perceptron refers to getting one data point at a time as if you were just loading data from "online". And that example is a correct instance yes.
