 Are project grades the same as the ones on canvas? I remember seeing somewhere that the autograder's grade isn't the final grade, though the ones on canvas are the same, plus I didn't see any updates on previous projects' grades.

  It's the same as the ones on Canvas. The autograder's grade is the final grade.
