 My findknn implementation passes both tests, but when I try the interaction, lines connecting the points do not appear. I tried restarting the kernel, rerunning all the cells, and closing and opening the program. Could there be a bug the autograder isn't catching?

  I think there can possibly be a bug there. I ran into similiar issue last semester and was able to see expected result after fixing a minor bug. Please feel free to post detailed question about your code if the bug continues to exist!
