  I think it's true. Suppose you have some hypothesis space $\mathcal H$, and you pick the $h\in\mathcal H$ that minimizes training error. Now suppose you add additional hypotheses to get a new hypothesis space $\mathcal H'\supseteq\mathcal H$. If you choose a new hypothesis $h'\in\mathcal H'$ that minimizes training error, it has to have at most the training error of $h$, because $h\in\mathcal H'$ and you chose $h'\in\mathcal H'$ to minimize training error.

  Adding new hypotheses to the hypothesis space enlarges the constraint set. The previously optimal hypothesis is still feasible under the new hypothesis space, so in the worse case your algorithm will just return the same model if nothing better has been added.
