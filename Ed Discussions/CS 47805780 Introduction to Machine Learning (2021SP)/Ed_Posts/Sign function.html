  On pg. 4 of the neural net slides the graph of the sign function seems to map negative values to zero. I thought it mapped negative values to -1. Which is correct?

  A good rule is to never rely on how exactly this is defined. If you are working with floating point numbers, testing for equality is not reliable.

  For the purposes of the homework or the exam, if you really need to rely on how a function is defined when testing a real number for equality, please explicitly specify the definition you are using.
