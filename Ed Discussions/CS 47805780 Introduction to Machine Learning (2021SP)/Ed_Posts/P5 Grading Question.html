 Hi!
</p>
<p>
 I've been getting ahead on project 5, and have this weird thing where the test cases for the smoothing function work, but the naive bayes test fails on the smoothing case.
</p>
<p>
 I'm not sure how to debug this since it seems the error isn't coming from the smoothing function but the naive bayes based on the fact that the smoothing function passes the tests, but the naive bayes only fails for the smoothing case?
</p>

  It seems like maybe something in your implementation of
  <code>
   naivebayes
  </code>
  is off, but it's hard to tell from just the description of your question. I would encourage you to come to office hours, or you can also make a private post on here.
