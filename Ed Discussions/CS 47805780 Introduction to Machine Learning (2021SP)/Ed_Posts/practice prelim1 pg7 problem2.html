 In the review session, it was mentioned that Euclidean distance is not a good measure of dissimilarity because the scaling/dimensions of each of the features are different. But I don't really understand why the difference in scaling/dimensions of each of the features is related to Euclidean distance?
</p>
<p>
 Also, what would be an alternative distance metric?

  Differences in age and differences in income in USD can be quite different without normalizing, so it's possible for one feature to "dominate" the Euclidean distance, making the dissimilarity measure quite biased

   I see. What would be an alternative distance metric then? Or would we still use Euclidean distance as long as we normalize beforehand?

    the same Euclidean distance can be used after features are normalized :)
