 I'm trying to rearrange the inequality to get the second theorem from the first, but I keep getting the inequality sign backwards. Does anyone have any suggestions on what I could be doing wrong?

  The value on the right becomes $\delta$ when you plug in $m$ instead of $1-\delta$. When you turn it into $1-\delta$ you take the complement of the probability, which should reverse the inequality.

  Not sure if that was where you were tripping up, but hope it helped!

   I'm still kind of confused. Here is what I did:
   <break>
   </break>
   $\delta \leq 2|H| *e^{- \epsilon^{2} m / 2}$
  </p>
  <p>
   $ln(\delta / (2|H|)) \leq$  $- \epsilon^{2} m /2$
  </p>
  <p>
   $ m \leq 2/\epsilon^{2} (ln|H| + ln(2/\delta))$
  </p>
  <p>
   What did I do wrong?

    The issue is in the first step. You want the upper bound to be less than delta, not the other way around.
