 <paragraph>
  When we plug in (epsilon/2) into hoeffding's inequality, shouldn't the upper bound become
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  {size of hypothesis space H} * 2 * exp(-(m*epsilon^2)/2^2) ?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  That is, shouldn't the "2" in the denominator of the exp function be squared, since "epsilon" is squared in hoeffding's inequality?

  Hoeffding's inequality normally has the term $2e^{-2m\epsilon^{2}}$ on the RHS. So the $2$ cancels with the $4$ in the denominator (taken from the

  wiki).
