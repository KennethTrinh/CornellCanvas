 When we plug in (epsilon/2) into hoeffding's inequality, shouldn't the upper bound become
</p>
<p>
 {size of hypothesis space H} * 2 * exp(-(m*epsilon^2)/2^2) ?
</p>
<p>
 That is, shouldn't the "2" in the denominator of the exp function be squared, since "epsilon" is squared in hoeffding's inequality?

  Hoeffding's inequality normally has the term $2e^{-2m\epsilon^{2}}$ on the RHS. So the $2$ cancels with the $4$ in the denominator (taken from the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoeffding%27s_inequality">
   wiki
  </a>
  ).
