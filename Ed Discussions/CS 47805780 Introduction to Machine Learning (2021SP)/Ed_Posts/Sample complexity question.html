 Tell me if my reasoning is correct: We know $h_{s}$, so there is no randomness about what it is. That means That the difference between its sample error and prediction error is an unknown constant (rather than a random variable). That is why we cannot directly treat it as a random variable, so we have to use union bounds to get a random variable.

  What's going on here is that we cannot treat h_s as random because it is deterministic based on the sampleâ€“whatever h in H gives the best sample error will be chosen. So we have to consider each h_i we could have chosen and look at its performance on the sample, and apply the union bound

   Why does h_s being deterministic mean we have to do this?

    It's not directly because h_s is deterministic, it's because it's the
    <i>
     best
    </i>
    , so we need to apply the union bound because it could be any one of the h_i.
