 I don’t want to distract you from preparing for Prelim 2, but here are a few things to get on your radar regarding the final project so you can plan.

   You can do the final project in groups of 1-3 students. You can form these groups yourself, or ask to be included in a partner-finding survey (similar to what we did for the homeworks).

   Only students that take the class for letter grade participate in the final project.

   More detailed instructions about the final project will come out after Prelim 2. The final project will be due on Thursday, May 13.

 In general, the final project will be more open-ended than the programming projects 1-5. It simulates how you would apply machine learning to a real-world problem, including the preprocessing of the data and the formulation of the learning problem. Lecture content about this will come out on Friday. Much of the final project will rest upon how you make good design decisions in your ML pipeline, and that you document it well. But part of the project is about being creative in getting good prediction performance. I am curious what interesting ideas you will come up with! But, as I say, I don’t want to distract you from the prelim...
