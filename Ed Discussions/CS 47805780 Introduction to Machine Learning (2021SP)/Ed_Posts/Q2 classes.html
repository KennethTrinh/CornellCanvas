 With Q2a, we're given seven points, each in one of two classes. When carrying out the KNN algorithm for each point, are we only considering points in the same class to be valid neighbors, or different classes? Or is the class irrelevant to this part of the question?

  In Q2 a, you are asked to draw the decision boundary, which is equivalent to asking, for any given point, how should that point be classified using KNN where k=1. Keep in mind that those seven points are "training data", therefore they are already labeled.
