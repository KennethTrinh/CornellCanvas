  I wonder what would be the recommended courses if we want to learn more about ML? Thanks!

  This is such a great question, and while I can't speak for all of course staff, I can give my perspective. From the undergrad course offering:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  - CS 4670 CV focuses on the CNNs and vision we didn't really touch-- this is my favorite subfield of ML so I might be biased but it's a very good intro.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  - CS 4740 with Cardie is a course that will teach you a lot about NLP and from my friends perspective the projects are challenging but rewarding.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  - CS 4786 (if offered) seems to have been a great course for unsupervised methods and practical applications.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  - CS 4787 is a fantastic course that builds directly off of 4780 (almost like a part 2) and De Sa is an electric professor.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  - CS 4789 is a new course (focusing on RL) but have heard very good things. Rather math heavy in comparison. Reinforcement learning is a really neat kind of ML.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Random Ones You Might Not Think Of
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  - CS 4220 is a math course but has many things that apply to ML
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  - INFO 4300 is a hidden gem of a course taught by DNM iirc that
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  There are courses on top of the ones I listed that deal with ML that I've left out, intentionally and unintentionally, but in the list above you will find some awesome semesters.

  I would say that ORIE 4741 was one of the courses I ommitted unintentionally. Really practical course with a final project at the end that's larger in scope than ours, you will find a lot of the content repeats what you've learned in 4780.

  Oh and I forgot to ask about STSCI 4740 (if you happen to know about that one too)!

  Ooh never heard of this course prior, but looking at the description it seems very similar to a subset of 4780.
