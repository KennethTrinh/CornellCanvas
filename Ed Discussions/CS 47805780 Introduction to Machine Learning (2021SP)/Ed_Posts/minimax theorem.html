  The outer min/max is making the decision first, and then the inner one is. If you think about this from the perspective of the minimizer: in the first, it's choosing w such that it has the lowest possible max objective. In the second, the a has already been chosen, so you're minimizing the objective for the already chosen a, so the minimizer has more information, basically.
