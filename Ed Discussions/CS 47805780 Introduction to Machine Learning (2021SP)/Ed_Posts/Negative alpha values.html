 In my
 <code>
  dualqp()
 </code>
 implementation,
 <code>
  cvxpy
 </code>
 does not seem to be adhering to my
 <code>
  alpha &gt;= 0
 </code>
 constraint. My implementation passes the test cases, but when I print the alpha values, they are half negative and half positive. They are all very small values, hovering very very close to zero (e-10 or e-11). If i change my constraint to be greater than a different number, say 5 or 0.1, it does not violate the constraint. It only appears to violate the constraint when forcing
 <code>
  alpha &gt;= 0
 </code>
 . I did try
 <code>
  alpha &gt;=  1e-99
 </code>
 , which also failed, giving  negative alpha values. However, the function passes its test cases  with
 <code>
  alpha &gt;= 0
 </code>
 .

  I was able  to solve this by adding the constraint to alpha when the variable was initialized, e.g.
  <code>
   Variable(nonneg=True)
  </code>
