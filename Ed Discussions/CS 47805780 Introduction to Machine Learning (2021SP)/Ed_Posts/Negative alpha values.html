  In my
  <code>
   dualqp()
  </code>
  implementation,
  <code>
   cvxpy
  </code>
  does not seem to be adhering to my
  <code>
   alpha &gt;= 0
  </code>
  constraint. My implementation passes the test cases, but when I print the alpha values, they are half negative and half positive. They are all very small values, hovering very very close to zero (e-10 or e-11). If i change my constraint to be greater than a different number, say 5 or 0.1, it does not violate the constraint. It only appears to violate the constraint when forcing
  <code>
   alpha &gt;= 0
  </code>
  . I did try
  <code>
   alpha &gt;=  1e-99
  </code>
  , which also failed, giving  negative alpha values. However, the function passes its test cases  with
  <code>
   alpha &gt;= 0
  </code>
  .

  I was able  to solve this by adding the constraint to alpha when the variable was initialized, e.g.
  <code>
   Variable(nonneg=True)
  </code>
