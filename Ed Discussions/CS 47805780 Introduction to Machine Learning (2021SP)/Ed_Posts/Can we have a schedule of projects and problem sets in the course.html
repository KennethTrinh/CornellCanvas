  Reiterating #110. I find it very difficult to plan around the assignments in this course due to the lack of an assignment schedule. I'm taking 4 other courses this semester that are very clear on their deliverables for the entire semester, but I was frustrated that I couldn't find a similar list for ML. Even if the schedule were tentative and subject to change, or even if it were based on an outdated schedule from when this course was taught last semester, it would be better than nothing.

  If all goes according to plan, we will be on a two week-cycle with homeworks and projects. Homeworks typically come out on Tuesdays and projects on Fridays. That means HW2 will come out next Tuesday, and P2 will come out next Friday. And this then repeats every two weeks for the total of 5 homeworks and 5 projects.
