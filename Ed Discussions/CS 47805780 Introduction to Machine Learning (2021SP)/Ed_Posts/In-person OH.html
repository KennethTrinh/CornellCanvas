  Hi everyone, I'll be hosting office hours in Rhodes 406 from 5-6 on Mondays before homeworks are due for anyone who'd like to attend in-person office hours (including today- sorry for the late notice!). Due to COVID regulations only 4 people can be in the room at once, so you'll have to sit in the hallway if it gets too crowded.  Hope to see you all there!
