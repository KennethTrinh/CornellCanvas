 Can the quizzes from this past week's lectures be unlocked so that we can be able to review the questions and correct answers, even after the quiz deadline has passed? Thanks!

  I tried - and failed. Canvas has a strange behavior, and if you have not attempted a quiz, it does not show you the result for some reason. Sigh.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, let me post the questions and answers here:
 </p>
 <list style="bullet">
  <li>
   <p>
    How will the decision boundary of k-NN change when you increase the value of k? --&gt; The decision boundary will become smoother.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Which properties apply to the k-NN algorithm? --&gt; It applies to both multi-class classification and regression.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    What algorithm would you use for computing a consistent decision tree given a set of training examples and why? --&gt; Top-Down Induction of Decision Trees. Because it is more efficient than List-then-Eliminate
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Let V be the version space for a hypothesis space H and a set of training example S. You add a new training example to S and recompute the version space and call it V'. --&gt; V' is a non-strict subset of V.
   </p>
  </li>
 </list>

   Thank you!

   I have some questions on the quiz questions:
  </p>
  <list style="bullet">
   <li>
    <p>
     For #2, how do we know that KNN would apply to both multi-class classification and regression problems? Also, would KNN only apply to multi-class classification problems, or also binary classification problems (i.e. can we consider a binary classification as a special case of the multi-class classification problem where k=2?) ?
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     For #4, how do we know V' will be a non-strict subset of V? And, by "non-strict", does it mean that V' can contain elements that were not originally in V, or what is the definition of "non-strict subset" here?
    </p>
   </li>
  </list>

    I don't quite get the question for #2, but A is a non-strict subset of B means A can equal B(A is not necessarily smaller than B).

    <p>
     In what cases would V' = V and in what cases would V' be a strict subset of V?
    </p>
    <p>
     For the former, would it have to be true that the new training example is equal to one of the examples in the original set of training examples S?
    </p>
    <p>
     For the latter, would it have to be true that the new training example is different from the examples in the original set of training examples S?
    </p>
