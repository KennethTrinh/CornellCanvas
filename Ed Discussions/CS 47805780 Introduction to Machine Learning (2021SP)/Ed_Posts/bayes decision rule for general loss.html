  I don't understand how the expression in brackets on the RHS is the expected loss? I know that finding expected value of a discrete RV is sum(x*f(x)), where f(x) is the pmf of the RV.

 <paragraph>
  So, are we saying that P(Y=y'|X=x) is the pmf, and the general loss function is the RV?

  delta(y',y) is the loss for a particular choice of y' and P(Y=y'|X=x) is the probability of choosing the said y; this is basically just using the law of total probability and definition of expectation to write the expected loss as a weighted sum of the individual losses.
