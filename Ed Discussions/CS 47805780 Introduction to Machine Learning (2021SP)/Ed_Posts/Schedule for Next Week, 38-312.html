 We have Wellness Days next week Tuesday and Wednesday, and we want to make sure you get a break to recharge. So, we structured the schedule for next week so that you really can in good conscience drop your pens and keyboards during those two days and get a break.
</p>
<p>
 First, there are no discussion sections next week - neither on Wednesday, nor on Thursday or Friday.
</p>
<p>
 Second, while the homework is already due Monday before the wellness days, we don't want to penalize you for taking the wellness days off if you want to submit late. So, the wellness days do not count towards your late days. See the exact policy on the homework handout.
</p>
<p>
 Third, project 2 is coming out soon, but we add two days to the deadline to account for the fact that you are taking a break during the wellness days. This would put us on a Sunday deadline, but I don't want to have a weekend deadline either. So, let's add another two days, so that the deadline will be the following Tuesday. Again, see the exact policy on the project handout.
</p>
<p>
 Fourth, the lecture quizzes are not due on Wednesday as usual, but on Friday.
</p>
<p>
 This should keep your wellness days clear!
</p>
<p>
 Enjoy the (bit of a) break.
</p>
<p>
 Cheers
