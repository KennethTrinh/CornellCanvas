  I was using the second formula because the first formula does not really give a bound.
 </p>
 <p>
  But for the second formula I put delta=0.05, and I wanna make sure that delta is not 0.95.

   Edit: Found both were the same formula :)

    Hi, I think I'm stuck in a similar place. I don't understand how you're able to apply the second formula (sample complexity) to 2bi because it asks for the probability that the difference between the prediction and training error of $h_S$ is $\geq$ than 0.1 whereas the sample complexity theorem only tells you something about the difference between the the hypothesis with minimum training error and the hypothesis with minimum prediction error (these two are not guaranteed to be the same hypothesis). I also don't understand how you're able to apply the sample complexity theorem to 2bii since $h_{friend}$ doesn't necessarily have least empirical error. Can you give me any hints on where I'm going wrong?
