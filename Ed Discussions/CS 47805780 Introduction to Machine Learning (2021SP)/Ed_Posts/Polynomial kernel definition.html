 I am kind of confused on the definition of a polynomial kernel in implementing a kernelized svm. If x has dimensions 1xd and z has dimensions 1xd then x^TZ would have dimensions dxd which doesn't make sense because shouldn't it be a scalar?

 If I interpret x as having dimensions dx1 and z having dimensions dx1, then x^TZ would produce a scalar but then that would mess up the dimensions in the definition of linear kernel and it would become dxd instead of a scalar.

 Could I have some clarification on this? Thanks!

  This kernel function is designed to work on matrices, where the ith row of X or Z are a specific training/test point
