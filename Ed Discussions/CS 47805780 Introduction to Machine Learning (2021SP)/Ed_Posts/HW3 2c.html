  I find this question confusing because you're asking for a feature map for K(a,b), but it seems to me that feature maps are normally in terms of one variable and in this question there doesn't seem to be any way to separate the two variables.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  So we know that K1(a,b) is
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  \phi^1(a) \cdot \phi^1(b)
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  But there doesn't seem to be any way to calculate
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  \phi(a)
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  without also including b somewhere in the expression, which seems to violate the point of a feature map. The only idea I had to get around this was to assume that we plug the same variable in for both spots in K1 so that K1 (a,b) really means:
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  \phi^1(a)\cdot\phi^1(a)
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  I'm sure I'm misunderstanding this problem in some way, so any advice as to how to better conceptualize the problem would be appreciated.

  From $K_1(a, b)K_2(a, b) = \phi_1(a)\cdot\phi_1(b) * \phi_2(a)\cdot\phi_2(b)$, you can find another $\phi$ such that  $\phi_1(a)\cdot\phi_1(b) * \phi_2(a)\cdot\phi_2(b) = \phi(a)\cdot\phi(b)$.
