 Its failing in the competition. It says Killed python3. Is this due to timeout ? If yes, any hints on the range of CList and lmbdaList to be considered ? And what is the size of CList and lmbdaList to be considered which helps to pass this ?

  Yes, this is due to the timeout. Keep in mind that you only have 5 minutes of runtime for each submission. You may want to try some smaller ranges of C and Lambda and submit multiple times, and then only keep the most optimal range for the final submission.
