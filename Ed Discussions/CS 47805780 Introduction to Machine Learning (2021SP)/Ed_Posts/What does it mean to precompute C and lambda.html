  Several threads have recommended we precompute C and lambda to reduce runtime in the cross validation step. What does this mean and how is this different from what we did in the cross_validation function? In what context are we "sticking" with the C and lambda we have chosen?

  It is my understanding that to test a C and lambda we have to compute linear classifiers using dualSVM and then check the validation error for each combination. I don't see any steps to cut out in this process? One answer says: "Loop to find the best C and λ when training, but don't loop while testing. Just use the best C and λ."  but I don't see the point of testing if we aren't comparing the performance of different C and lambdas to one another?

  I'm pretty sure that like you said, find validation error on all C, lambda combinations. Then find the best combo and hard code that into your submission. If youre referring to #748 I dont think that answered how to improve cross validation runtime, rather how to prevent your submission from timing out

  I figured it out! You just test the different values of C and lambda yourself using the jypiter notebook through the empty spaces at the bottom. Then when you submit hard code in c and lambda
