 When the slide says the error discrepancy of h* is included, does it mean that we can have the first term as P[|err_S(h_S)-err_P(h_S)|&gt;e/2 OR |err_S(h*)-err_P(h*)|&gt;e/2] and carry on with the same calculation?

  Are you referring to the top right where it says err_s(h*)-err_p(h*)&gt;eps/2? in that case, all it's noting is that it's also accounting for when the optimal hypothesis performs particularly bad on our sample.
