  For any value less than zero, the derivative of ReLU is zero, which means that if the network wants the value of a node to increase, it would get a zero gradient for that node and not change any of the relevant weights.

  This is preventing me from creating a working backpropagation function, too: all of the S values in the final layer are negative, which is giving me a zero gradient for the last layer, which makes everything else zero as well. How might I fix this?
