  Will we be rewarded if we reach MSE less than 150k on the private leaderboard? I was thinking that the public test set might be a little harder than the private test set by accident.

  From the handout:

 </paragraph>
 <blockquote>
  We are also planning to give some extra credit for particularly accurate solutions, in particular, those that get &lt;100k mean squared error on the private Kaggle test set or that are the among top 10 in Kaggle on the private part of the test set. Note that the test set is split to two parts in Kaggle, the score (accuracy/mean squared error) you see in Kaggle is the public part while the score on the private part of your submission is not visible until the final project is over. We will use the public accuracy for the 70% baseline and the 150k mean squared error creative solution, but for the extra credit you have to do well on the private accuracy. Hence getting into the top 10 in the public leader board does not guarantee the extra credit, which is again part of the realism of working in machine learning.

  Your (non extra-credit) score on the creative portion will still be determined by your chosen method, your stated reasoning, any creative ideas you incorporated etc.
