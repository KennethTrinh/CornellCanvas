  When I try to use a polynomial kernel with any parameter value other than 1, I get the error:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  SolverError: Solver 'ECOS' failed. Try another solver, or solve with verbose=True for more information.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  When I try setting verbose=True, it gives me the error: Slacks/multipliers leaving the cone, recovering best iterate (0) and stopping.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Does this mean there is something wrong with my implementation?

  Was this ever resolved? I'm getting a similar error, and I've made sure that I'm using no "@" symbols or numpy methods in my convex solver code.

  I resolved this by removing the "ECOS" specification from my solver.

  Strange that it's the kernel that triggers it. But it's always a good idea to double check the convex solver code for uses of numpy functions, or "@" matrix multiplications, etc.
