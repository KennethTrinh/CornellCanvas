 We graded prelim 2 last night, and overall you again did very well. The raw mean and median are close to those of prelim 1, but ended up a tad lower. Looking back at prelim 2, the questions may have been a bit harder, so I am revising the scores up by the following formula to make them equal to those of prelim 1 (which I promised to be calibrated with prelim 2). So, if you see your prelim 2 score on Gradescope, you can use the following formula to boost your score upwards:
</p>
<p>
 FinalPrelim2Score = 100 - (100 - Prelim2ScoreOnGradescope)*0.85
</p>
<p>
 These boosted grades are the ones I will use for making the final course grades. I just released the grades on Gradescope. After boosting, the median score is 83, the mean is 81, and the standard deviation is 11 (which are all exactly the same as on prelim 1). The typical grading scale (see FAQ on Canvas) mapping scores to letter grades should help you understand your numeric score.
</p>

 The solutions will be available on Canvas later tonight. The deadline for submitting regrade requests is May 11.
