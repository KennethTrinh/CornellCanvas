 This has been an extraordinary semester for all of the Cornell community, and I heard from many of you how your semester was disrupted. We already had a lot of flexibility on deadlines, and we already have a policy that essentially lets you skip one homework and one project. But for many of you, this has not been enough since there were multiple disruptions. Instead of making many exceptions, I will relax the rules for everbody's benefit and be more forgiving if you missed (or did poorly) on two homeworks or projects. Here is the new grading rule for the final grades:
</p>
<list style="bullet">
 <li>
  <p>
   Replace the lowest TWO of the five homework grades with the third lowest homework grade.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Replace the lowest TWO of the five project grades with the third lowest project grade.
  </p>
 </li>
</list>
<p>
 In addition, for the final project I extend the deadline by one day. So, the new deadline for the final project is
</p>
<list style="bullet">
 <li>
  <p>
   Friday, 5/14, at 11:59pm
  </p>
 </li>
</list>
<p>
 This is truly the final opportunity to submit. After that we have to start grading.

   Time-Zone conversions are literally harder than finding the growth function.. I think it's all good now.
