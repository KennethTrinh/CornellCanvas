 Could you provide some advice for how to start this question? Is there a formula for getting a normalized weight vector?

  The idea is that you can "reuse" the w and b you got from 1b) i). Consider the following: if I know that $\mathbf w\mathbf x+b = 0$ represents my desired hyperplane, what does $(c\mathbf w) \mathbf x + cb = 0$ as a line look like? i.e. what effect (or lack thereof) does scaling my w and b by a factor $c$ have? Knowing this, how can I force the magnitude of some vector to be 1?

  Normalizing some arbitrary vector $v$ is easy, by the way. Get its unit vector by dividing by its magnitude. But, you should convince yourself that the unit vector you get after such a division actually represents the hyperplane you want.
