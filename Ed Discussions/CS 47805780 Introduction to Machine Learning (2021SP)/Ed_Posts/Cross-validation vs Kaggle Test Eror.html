  My cross-validation error seems to be super inaccurate/not informative of the test error when I submit to Kaggle (for instance, parameter settings with cross-validation of 1,000,000 MSE leads to a solution that is 400,000 MSE better than parameter setting with cross-validation of 60,000 MSE). I've tried a couple of different splitting techniques in sklearn, but I can't get the cross-validation to be any more informative. Any ideas for why this might be happening?

  I don't think this can be addressed without more knowledge about your specific codeâ€“I'd recommend dropping into office hours or reaching out to your assigned TA (or make a private post with more details if you really want to make use of edstem or the other avenues are not available).
