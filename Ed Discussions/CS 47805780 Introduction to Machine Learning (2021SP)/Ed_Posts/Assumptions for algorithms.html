  Hi. I'm kind of confused with the questions that ask "what assumptions are we making about the data when using x algorithm?". Is there a general rule of thumb for what's already "given" with the data we're working with, and what's not "given" (and therefore have to assume when using certain algorithms)? And if necessary, what resource I should use to learn more about this?

  I would say that an example of the above is that for a vanilla linear classifier, that we make the assumption that our data must be linearly separable, otherwise we can't draw a consistent hyperplane. Off the top of my head, I don't know if there are any other assumptions we make about data other than maybe for the same set of features we assume so far in the course the output label is deterministically determined.

  Would it be also okay to say that we assume that the data is pulled from an iid sample?
