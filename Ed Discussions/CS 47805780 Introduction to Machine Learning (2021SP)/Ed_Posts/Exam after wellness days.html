 Hi!
</p>
<p>
 I am aware we have our second prelim on the 29th of April, which is 2 days after our wellness days. Given that we are meant to be able to take these "wellness days" off, we would really only have a few days to study for the exam in earnest.
</p>
<p>
 I'm wondering if the course staff/ professor have considered this at all?
</p>

  Unfortunately, the date for the prelims is determined centrally by the university for each course, so it is not a date that I got to pick.
 </p>
 <p>
  But to make sure you have a clear plate, I am not putting out new material for the week of the second prelim - no new lectures, no quiz, and no new discussion material. Furthermore, I made sure that homeworks and projects are due and over well before the prelim. The last homework of the class will be due on 4/20 already, and the last project will be due on 4/22 - which is a full week before the prelim. I hope this gives you enough peace-of-mind to actually take a break.
 </p>
 <p>
  BTW: The prelim is on Thursday 4/29, which is three days after the wellness days. Just making sure. Is there a typo somewhere with a different date?
