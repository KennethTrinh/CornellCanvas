  Do you call vectors inside margin 1 support vectors? Or do we only call vectors on the 1 margin support vectors

  I think for hard margin SVM it is only the ones on the support vectors, and for soft margin any point on or within the margin is a support vector (or any point that has an alpha != 0 because these ones have weight when pushing the decision boundary).
