  I'm running my l2distance which is generating the wrong answer, and I've been testing quite a bit and have found that it seems to get small errors, eg. when I run it with only an X, the diagonal will all be e-14 or so variables. And all the other terms are essentially correct but from the first few digits but I suspect they also have errors down the line. Is there any way to correct this? I would greatly appreciate any help.

  This seems like an implementation specific question (hard to debug without seeing the code). Could you please send us a private message with screenshots of your code and inputs/outputs? There are also office hours today if that's more helpful.

  Additionally, errors of e-16 are floating-point error, and it looks like your error is around that scale, which is to be expected/accepted. And of course, you can ultimately rely on the vocareum submission score.
