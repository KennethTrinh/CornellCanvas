  For 1, Think about the contrapositive. Does a finite hypothesis class imply a finite VC dimension? The answer is yes because if there are $|H|$ functions in the hypothesis space,  the number of labelings we produce is at most $|H|$ since each hypothesis in $H$ can contribute at most one unique labeling.
  <break>
  </break>
  Remember that to shatter any $S$, $H$ has to produce $2^{|S|}$ labelings. Take any input set $S$ of size $|H|$. We only produce at most $|H|$ labelings which is less than the $2^{|H|}$ needed. This means that the VC-dim must be less than $|H|$.

  For 2, we've seen many infinite hypothesis classes that have finite VC dimension. Example: thresholds on the real number line is an infinite hypothesis space with finite vc dimension.
