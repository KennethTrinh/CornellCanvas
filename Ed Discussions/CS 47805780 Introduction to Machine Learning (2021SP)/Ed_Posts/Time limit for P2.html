 Do we have a time limit for project 2? Is it OK for my functions to run for more than 1 or 2 hours?

  I think my grading timed out and gave me a 0 after running for 150 seconds (even though the non-competition part runs and passes in a much shorter time than that)

  The autograder has a time limit built in, so it's important your code can run fast enough to get checked.
