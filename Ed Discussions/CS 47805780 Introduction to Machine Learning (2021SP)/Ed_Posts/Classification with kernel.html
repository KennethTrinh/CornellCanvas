 I have been having a lot of difficulty in using the kernel with
 <code>
  dualSVM
 </code>
 and producing a classification with it. More specifically, I am unsure of how to compute the K[xi, x] component, shown below circled in red. I understand I likely have to use computeK to produce another kernel with the test data x. But, I don't see how this is possible within the lambda function. More specifically, I am  unsure about which parameters to use for computeK. I  initially thought I should use the input x with itself,  but that produced a memory error due to such a large matrix. Any tips would be appreciated.

  In the formula above, x represents the new instance that you want to classify, like you said. The x_i's are instances from the training set (that you used to compute the alphas). We use the training set instances x_i and their alphas to classify new instances x.

   But isn't the kernel only defined for operations between the matrices it was computed for? If the new instance
   <b>
    x
   </b>
   is not part of the training data (which the kernel was computed from), then do we have to recompute the kernel for each new instance
   <b>
    x
   </b>
   ?

    Yes, sort of. The kernel is a function, so you can apply it to any two vectors.
   </p>
   <p>
    In your first call to computeK, you apply the kernel function on the training data with itself (calling computeK(xTr,xTr)). From here, you derive the alphas.
   </p>
   <p>
    Then to classify new points x, you must reapply the kernel function to the training data and x (ie calling computeK(xTr, x)). To classify x, you use computeK(xTr,x) as well as the alphas derived from calling computeK(xTr,xTr).
