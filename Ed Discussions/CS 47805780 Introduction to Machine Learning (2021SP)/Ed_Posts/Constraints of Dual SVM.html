  I'm confused about how sum (y_i alpha_i) = 0 is derived from the non-homogeneity, also the constraint on alpha_i &lt;= C.

  First, alpha_i&lt;=C comes from the definition of duality. By complementary slackness if a constraint is slack in primal, its dual is positive. C constitutes our trade-off between slackness and classification loss. I recommend this as reference for converting primal linear programs into dual and back:
  <link href="http://web.mit.edu/15.053/www/AMP-Chapter-04.pdf"/>
  AMP-Chapter-04.pdf (mit.edu) See, in particular, page 141. In our setup the primal is the dual in that definition. C is the coefficient for each epsilon and alpha_i is the corresponding dual variable for each constraint.

  As for sum(y_i alpha_i)=0, see below.

  Denote our primal problem in a Lagrangian form with a bias as before (see lecture 09b, for instance)
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  L\left(\alpha,w,b\right)=\frac{1}{2}w\cdot w+\sum_i^{ }\alpha_{i\ }\left(1-y_iw\cdot x_{i\ }-y_{i\ }b\right)
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  Take first order conditions:
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  \frac{\partial L\left(\alpha,\ w,\ b\right)}{\partial w}=w-\sum_i^{ }\alpha_iy_ix_i=0
 </math>
 <math>
  \frac{\partial L\left(\alpha,\ w,\ b\right)}{\partial b}=-\sum_i^{ }\alpha_iy_i=0
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  Therefore
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  \sum_i^{n}y_i \alpha_i =0
 </math>
