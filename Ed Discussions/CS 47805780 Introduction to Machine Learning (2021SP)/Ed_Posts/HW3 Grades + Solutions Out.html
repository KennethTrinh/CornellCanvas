  Hello everyone,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  HW3 solutions and grades are available on canvas/box and gradescope respectively. If you did not submit before Thursday at 5pm, we will still need a while to grade your submissions, but feel free to discuss the answer key or any other questions you have in OH before the prelim.

  Regrades are due in 1 week but will be extended for those who will be getting graded for HW3 later.

  Note that the mean is low, since the late submissions had not been graded and gradescope counts them as zero.
