 Is it acceptable to have an expression in terms of the sample error, alpha, and n (meaning not using epsilon at all, as I don't think it's necessary and/or standard for Hoeffding Confidence Intervals)?

  Epsilon in this context is a function of the parameters you listed. So, the final answer actually is in terms of sample error, alpha and n. But you still need to demonstrate how you arrive at this answer
