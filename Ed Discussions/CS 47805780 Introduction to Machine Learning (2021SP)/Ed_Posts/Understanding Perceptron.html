  Given one point
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  y_i(\vec{w}^{(t)}\cdot\vec{x_i})\le0
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  would the new plane learn something? In other words, would
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  y_i(\vec{w}^{(t+1)}\cdot\vec{x_i})&gt;0\ ?
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  I tried to work out that myself but to make that true, it has to satisfy
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  cos(theta)|w|&lt;|xi|. whereas theta is angle between w and xi. which is not always true. Am I doing it correctly? If so, why would this step help at all if it doesn't even correct the point it makes mistakes on. In general, Also I know it will eventually converge as we proved, I don't understand why it goes towards the right direction each step.

  It won't necessarily go from negative to positive in a single iteration, but it will most certainly become less negative after the update. This is because
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  y_i\left(\vec{w}^{\left(t+1\right)}\cdot\vec{x_i}\right)=y_i\left(\left(\vec{w}^{\left(t\right)}+y_i\vec{x_i}\right)\cdot\vec{x_i}\right)=y_i\left(\vec{w}^{\left(t+1\right)}\cdot\vec{x_i}\right)+\vec{\left|\left|x_i\right|\right|}
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  Tldr it won't necessarily make it not misclassified after one iteration, but it will make it closer to correctly classified.
