 Given one point
</p>
<math>
 y_i(\vec{w}^{(t)}\cdot\vec{x_i})\le0
</math>
<p>
 would the new plane learn something? In other words, would
</p>
<math>
 y_i(\vec{w}^{(t+1)}\cdot\vec{x_i})&gt;0\ ?
</math>
<p>
 I tried to work out that myself but to make that true, it has to satisfy
</p>
<p>
 cos(theta)|w|&lt;|xi|. whereas theta is angle between w and xi. which is not always true. Am I doing it correctly? If so, why would this step help at all if it doesn't even correct the point it makes mistakes on. In general, Also I know it will eventually converge as we proved, I don't understand why it goes towards the right direction each step.
</p>

  It won't necessarily go from negative to positive in a single iteration, but it will most certainly become less negative after the update. This is because
 </p>
 <math>
  y_i\left(\vec{w}^{\left(t+1\right)}\cdot\vec{x_i}\right)=y_i\left(\left(\vec{w}^{\left(t\right)}+y_i\vec{x_i}\right)\cdot\vec{x_i}\right)=y_i\left(\vec{w}^{\left(t+1\right)}\cdot\vec{x_i}\right)+\vec{\left|\left|x_i\right|\right|}
 </math>
 <p>
  Tldr it won't necessarily make it not misclassified after one iteration, but it will make it closer to correctly classified.
