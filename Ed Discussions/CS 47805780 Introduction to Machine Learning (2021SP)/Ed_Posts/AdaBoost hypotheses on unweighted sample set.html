<p>
 Is it true that the iterating hypotheses
 <i>
  hâ‚œ
 </i>
 would actually perform worse on the
 <b>
  unweighted
 </b>
 sample set as
 <i>
  t
 </i>
 increases? I am getting that impression from the discussion problem.

  Each h_t is designed to perform well on a particular subset of the data, and so may not perform well on the whole dataset.
