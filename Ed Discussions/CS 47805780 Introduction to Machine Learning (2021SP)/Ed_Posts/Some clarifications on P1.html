  Hi, I got some questions on project 1.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Are we allowed to submit and check our code before the deadline? And how are we supposed to submit the project for the final grading?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For the last part of project 1, when using 1-NN, I got an extremely low accuracy, which was around 4.17%. Is that suggesting that there's something wrong with my code?

  1. Yes, you can click "submit" and you will get feedback from the autograder. You can submit as many times as you want before the deadline. The last submission is used for the final grading.

  2. There is something wrong with your code. You can submit and see if the helper functions pass the tests.
