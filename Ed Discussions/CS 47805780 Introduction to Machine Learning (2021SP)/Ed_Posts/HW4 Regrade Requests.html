 Hello all,
</p>
<p>
 In order to process the regrades on late submissions for HW4, we'll open up the regrade requests for the whole class on gradescope for 5 days.
</p>
<p>
 <i>
  Regrade requests made by students who got their grades/feedback in the first wave will be dismissed
 </i>
 . We will only be looking at regrade requests for those who made late submissions for HW4.
</p>
