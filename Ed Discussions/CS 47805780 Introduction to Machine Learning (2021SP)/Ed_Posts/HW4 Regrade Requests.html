  Hello all,

 <paragraph>
  In order to process the regrades on late submissions for HW4, we'll open up the regrade requests for the whole class on gradescope for 5 days.

  <italic>
   Regrade requests made by students who got their grades/feedback in the first wave will be dismissed
  </italic>
  . We will only be looking at regrade requests for those who made late submissions for HW4.
