 I just had a couple clarifying questions, is the new Hypothesis Space only limited to the sum of two attributes with a threshold at 0? Or, can you threshold at any number?
</p>
<p>
 Secondly, is g(A, B) counted as a separate hypothesis as g(B, A)? My intuition is that it shouldn't, but just making sure. Thanks.

  (1) As long as your hypothesis only uses the sum of two attributes to make predictions it should be fine. (2) g(A, B) is the same as g(B, A)

   Sorry, I am confused with (1) here. Does it mean that hypothesis space can also include functions like g(A,B)&gt;1, g(A,B)&gt;-1, not only limited to g(A,B)&gt;0?

    Agreed. I assumed we had to set A + B &gt; 0 but this answer confused me. Can anyone clear this up?
