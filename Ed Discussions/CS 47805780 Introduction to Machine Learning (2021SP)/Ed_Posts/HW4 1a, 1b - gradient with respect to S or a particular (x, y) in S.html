 For HW4 1a and 1b, do we find the gradient with respect to S or a particular example (x, y) in S? In 1b it says single example update so I think it is a particular example, but please confirm. Also, I am not sure which to do for 1a. Any guidance would be greatly appreciated

  Realized that with respect to is probably not the right word, I guess considering the entire set S or just one example

   Actually, I think the answer is with respect to S for 1a and a particular example (x, y) for 1b in case anyone is wondering. If anyone wants to confirm that I wouldn't be mad.

  Gradient descent, unless explicitly otherwise (i.e. stochastic/batch), can be assumed to be with respect to the entire dataset.
