  I don't understand the bottom equation there. If ρ(x, x
  <italic>
   πi(x)) &lt;
  </italic>
  ρ(x, xπi+1(x)), wouldn't we give less weight to the points that are actually closer to the input x?

  I agree! That rule does not make much sense, since it gives more weight to the nearest neighbors that are further away. Note that I have the same formula in my lecture slides, but with a big difference. I use a similarity measure K to determine the k nearest neighbors, not a distance function $\rho$. A similarity measure becomes larger the more similar the two features vectors are, which makes the weighting formula on my slides more sensible.
