  Hi everyone,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  This is an announcement telling you to please resubmit Project 1, especially if you saw a discrepancy between your Vocareum score and your Canvas score. Some grading issues were recently resolved, and we hope things work now.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Please note that you can submit on Vocareum any number of times before the final due date.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thanks, and sorry for the inconvenience!
