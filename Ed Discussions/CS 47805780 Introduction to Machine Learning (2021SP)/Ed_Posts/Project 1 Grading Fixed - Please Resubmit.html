 Hi everyone,
</p>
<p>
 This is an announcement telling you to please resubmit Project 1, especially if you saw a discrepancy between your Vocareum score and your Canvas score. Some grading issues were recently resolved, and we hope things work now.
</p>
<p>
 Please note that you can submit on Vocareum any number of times before the final due date.
</p>
<p>
 Thanks, and sorry for the inconvenience!

   Yes, the last submission you make is what will be recorded as your grade.
