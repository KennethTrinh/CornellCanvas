  I think it only becomes clickable when the TA assigns you to them (which is a horrible design choice by queuemein) but you should be able to either copy and paste the zoom link into your browser, or find the zoom link in the OH calendar.

   Yeah, but some TAs do not have zoom links in the calendar available on canvas. May I see those zoom links somewhere ?

    Oh, that's strangeâ€“are they missing from queuemein entirely? In that case it's likely that they've been having the same issue I have, where the zoom link disappears from the queuemein page when OH starts. If you tag the TA with a missing OH link or give me their name we can try to go ahead and fix it.

     And when I try to join link from queuemein, by clicking join, neither link shows up nor I'll be able to join directly from hyperlink.

      Are you looking for Jonathan's zoom link? In that case it was hyperlinked in the "Join Zoom Meeting" line:

       This hyperlink is not visible for me as a student user when I hover it to join button. Thankfully Jonathan's office hour link is also visible on canvas calendar, so that's the  work around I've been using all days. But, a few TAs zoom links aren't available on calendar too whose office hours are right now impossible to join for me and I don't know how others are managing to join those

        Right, the missing join hyperlink is a queuemein bug from the looks of it. If you mention any TAs with a missing zoom link I can ask them to update the calendar.

         Tuesday: 2pm-4pm and 4pm to 6pm TAs have no links in the calendar.
        </p>

         Thursday: 4pm-5pm TA too
        </p>
        <p>
         And there might be a bunch of other TAs too, but right now these are important because on thursday, we have prelim2

          Just messaged these TAs, they should be updated soon. Thanks for checking in, and we're sorry for the annoyance.
