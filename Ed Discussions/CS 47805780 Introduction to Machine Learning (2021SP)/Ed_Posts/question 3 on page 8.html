  I interpreted this to mean directly computing the classifier output as
 </p>
 <math>
  y\ =\ w'\cdot x'
 </math>
 <p>
  since for a regression problem,
  <i>
   y
  </i>
  is real-valued. Since it the support is not countable, using a piecewise classifier (
  <i>
   h(x)
  </i>
  in the binary classification problem) doesn't really make sense. The label is a real value and can be computed directly rather than forced into a set of discrete values like {-1,1} in the binary classification. problem.
