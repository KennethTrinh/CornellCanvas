 I just released a set of practice questions for Prelim 2 on Canvas. The first half are the practice questions that we already handed out for Prelim 1, and I suggest you go over those again. The second half is new questions. Try to solve these questions on your own. If you get stuck, come to the review session next Wednesday or go to office hours where the TA's can help you with the solution.
