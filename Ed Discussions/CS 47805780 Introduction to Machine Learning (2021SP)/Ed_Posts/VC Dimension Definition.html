  I got confused about the definition of vc dimension while doing a problem on the practice prelim. Just to make sure, the definition of VC Dim is #1, not #2, right?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1) VCDim = Size of largest shatterable set
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2) VCDim = Largest size such that every set of that size is shatterable
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  In the practice prelim, the question asks for VCDim given H = all convex polygons that label exteriors as -1 and interiors / borders as 1
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Assuming definition 1, VCDim would be infinite, since any set of points on a circle can be shattered. Is this correct?

  No, the VC dim is 2, the largest size where all sets are shatterable.
