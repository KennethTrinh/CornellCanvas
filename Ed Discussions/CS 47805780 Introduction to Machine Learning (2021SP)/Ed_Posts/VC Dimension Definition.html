 I got confused about the definition of vc dimension while doing a problem on the practice prelim. Just to make sure, the definition of VC Dim is #1, not #2, right?
</p>
<p>
 1) VCDim = Size of largest shatterable set
</p>
<p>
 2) VCDim = Largest size such that every set of that size is shatterable
</p>
<p>
 In the practice prelim, the question asks for VCDim given H = all convex polygons that label exteriors as -1 and interiors / borders as 1
</p>
<p>
 Assuming definition 1, VCDim would be infinite, since any set of points on a circle can be shattered. Is this correct?
</p>

  No, the VC dim is 2, the largest size where all sets are shatterable.

   Thank you! I was confused because the english definition in the slides seems to suggest #1:
