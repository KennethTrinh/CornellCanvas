  Tianyu uses a two-sided test in the problem statement (finding the absolute difference between the sample mean and true expectation, P{ |T-0.5Y| &gt; epsilon }.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For our argument in 3c, to show if all hedge funds were actually random but at least one got lucky and outperformed the market all 20 years, should we be using just the one-sided test (e.g. not using the absolute value of the difference), or should we use the two-sided test with the absolute value like Tianyu?

  You can use the double sided test.

  Is it also OK to use a one-sided test in our answer? I thought one-sided test seemed to align better with our goal of finding a fund that beats the market more times (specifically, more than 10 years) than our expectation.

  What exactly is the one sided test you used? The one-sided version of Hoeffding, at least, doesn't produce a tighter bound.

  Yes, I used $Pr(T - 0.5Y \geq \epsilon Y)$ which was also used in Question 1 of Discussion 7 by Prof. Joachims:

  It outputs a smaller upper bound on the probability because it gets rid of the multiplicative constant 2 before the exponential.

  Ah, looks like you're right. In that case, you should be fine to make use of the one-sided Hoeffding bound. That said, you may want to stick with the dual-sided, if for no other reason that that's what Tianyu used in the argument you're trying to validate..

  But I really don't think we should use the double sided test, as it not only evaluates the possibility a hedge fund gets all correct, it also evaluates the possibility that it gets all wrong, so the bound is less precise. Am I missing something here?

  Both are fine, as the probability of getting all correct or all incorrect is a superset of the probability of getting all correct.
