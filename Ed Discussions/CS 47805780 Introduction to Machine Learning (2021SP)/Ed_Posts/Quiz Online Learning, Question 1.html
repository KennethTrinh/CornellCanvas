 I found the question a little bit confusing. Does it assume a mistake bound model where the adversary keeps the sequence consistent with some hypothesis in $H$ (i.e., the realizable case)?
</p>
<p>
 And what does it mean to be "the best" bound?

  The adversarial sequence must be consistent with some hypothesis in H, and the best bound refers to a tight upper bound for the number of mistakes.
