  Since we've learned about k-fold cross validation and m-fold cross validation (ie. leave one out), how do they compare? I understand the differences in their processes, but what are the pros and cons of using each?

  m-fold gets a good approximation for the true error but is extremely slow to run; we run k-fold instead because it gets a decent approximation in much less time.
