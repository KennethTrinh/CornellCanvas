  For 3b, is part 1 asking about realizable sample complexity since it is drawn from the distribution, while part 2 is asking about generalizable sample complexity?

  i think 3b(i) is asking about  non realisable sample complexity because h_s is argmin h_s and there might not exist a perfect sample hypothesis. Therefore I believe that 3b(i) is actually non-realisable.
