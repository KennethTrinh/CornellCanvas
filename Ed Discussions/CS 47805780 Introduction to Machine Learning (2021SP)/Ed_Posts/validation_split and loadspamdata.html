  Can we feel free to just include the implementation of validation_split that we were provided in the starter code of the project as our final implementation for the submission without changing anything?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Also, for loadspamdata, do we have to replace the arguments on the provided loadspamdata call that assigns the data to X and Y with our own functions, or is it ungraded and just there for display?

  You shouldn't need to make any changes to the inputs to loadspamdata. As for validation_split, so long as you're passing the baseline accuracy you don't need to update it.

  I was unable to change the number of features considered without changing the B value in loadspam data to equal feature_dimension. Prior to making that change changing feature dimension did nothing for me. I even tried setting it to zero with no change.
