 I am planning to skip P5. Will my lowest grade(In this case P5 because I am not attempting it) be replaced by second lowest grade which is lowest  of the previous projects(lowest of P1, P2, P3, P4) ?
</p>
<p>
 Or should I just submit it blank for this to apply ? Also, will all the projects weight equal ? Because, we had P1 for 13 points and the rest sofar for 100 each. Also, is it safe for me to skip P5 given the existing rule or should I do that as well ?
</p>
<p>
 I have similar question about homeworks too.

  If you don't submit it will be counted as a 0 submission, and so be replaced by your next lowest grade. That said, I recommend against skipping the assignments since they're valuable preparation for the exam and final project.
