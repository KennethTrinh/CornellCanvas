 Regarding studying on Module 19 (Online Learning) and Module 20 (Boosting and Ensemble Methods) for prelim 2, I don't see many questions about the content of these two modules in the practice prelim questions, and we also have not had any homework assignments or projects on the content of these two modules. I was wondering how would you recommend us to best study for this specific content?

  Make sure you go over the material we studied in the discussion section for both Online Learning and Boosting. Also, take a look at questions 1,2 in the UML book at the end of Chapter 21. The questions at the end of the Boosting chapter in the UML book are all much too technical - I don't expect you to be able to solve those in the exam (rather, look at the types of problems we covered in discussion).
