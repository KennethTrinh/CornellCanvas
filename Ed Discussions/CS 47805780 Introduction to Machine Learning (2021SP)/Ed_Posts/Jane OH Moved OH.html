  Hey all,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Sorry for the late notice (and for anyone who has noticed, a rather turbulent OH scheduling this past week in general). I have moved my OH to Sunday, March 7, 11am-1pm EST. They were originally later in the afternoon, but I've had some scheduling mishaps. I'm always reachable by email (netid zd53).

  Best,
