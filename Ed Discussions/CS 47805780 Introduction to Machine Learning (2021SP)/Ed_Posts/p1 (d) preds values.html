 I understand that preds is supposed to be n x 1, but I'm unsure of what the pred values are supposed to represent. Are they supposed to be 0 or 1 depending on if it's a nearest neighbor or is it supposed to hold some other values?

  preds[i] should be the output of the knn classifier on the ith test point; i.e. the majority vote of the k nearest neighbors.
