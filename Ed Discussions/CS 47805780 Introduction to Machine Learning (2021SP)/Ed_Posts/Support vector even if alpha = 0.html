  If 2 support vectors are directly opposite each other. It's influence and alpha are equal, so if there exists another point that lies exactly on the margin of one of the sides, it's force/influence and alpha is 0. But this point lies on the margin and should be a support vector but its alpha is 0 which is contradicting that support vectors should have non-zero alphas.

  Our final definition was that support vectors are all point that have a non-zero alpha. And we did this for the very reason you outlined! This way we differentiate between points that actually influence the location of the hyperplane, and points that just touch the margin boundary.
