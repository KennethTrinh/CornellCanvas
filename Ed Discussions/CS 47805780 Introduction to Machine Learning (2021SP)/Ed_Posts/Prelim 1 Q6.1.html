 Why should we decrease C? Doesn't increasing C make it more like a hard-margin SVM and hence fewer training errors?
</p>
<p>
 How does C affect the sum of the slack variables and the norm of the weight vector?

  The problem you are given has 0 training error and the validation error is bad so you're overfitting. You're trying to improve the validation error. Right now it is essentially a hard-margin SVM, it has 0 training errors but you need to make it softer to allow some errors so that it can test better.

  Higher C -&gt; lower slack error &amp; increased norm of weight vector, lower C -&gt; higher slack error &amp; decreased norm of weight vector
 </p>
 <p>
  If C were say 0 then we don't care how many errors we get and so weight vector would be 0-vector just as intuition about why this is.
