  Short answer: same as it is in other parts of the pset; R = radius = biggest possible magnitude of a feature vector. Think, drawing a circle around your whole dataset -- this is the radius of that circle.

  But what does it mean specifically in the context of 3a? 09c-svm_leaveoneout.pdf -&gt; slide 4 has some relevant info, I think. Basically, it can be used to infer whether a given point can be a leave-one-out error.
