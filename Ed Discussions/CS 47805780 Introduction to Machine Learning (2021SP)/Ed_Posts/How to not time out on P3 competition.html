 My P3 competition times out and I have no idea what I could do to make it not time out. I'm already following the advice from #748 (choose a best lambda and C and stick with it), and the number of C and lambda values I test are both &lt;10. I'm very stumped about how to make my code faster.

  Check to make sure you're doing as little work to classify the test set as possible (once again c and lambda should already be calculated, etc.), and if it's still timing out it's possible that whatever function you're returning to perform the classification is implemented inefficiently (so you can try different ways to calculate the function output).
