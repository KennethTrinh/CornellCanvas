 I'm getting the above error when I run the momentum function after implementing backwards pass. This triggers on my implementation of act_func_der in ReLu. I believe this is occurring because it is trying to compare the entire array to a single value instead of the array element wise. I noticed that this would be an issue so I set it up with np.greater_than because it should enforce element wise comparison, but I still get the above error. My get_activation_func passes the test cases.
</p>
<p>
 Any idea why this is happening or what I can do to get it to run the function element wise as opposed to over the entire list?

  I used np.where() for the derivative of activation_f

   I used np.maximum() and it seemed to work!

    Turns out the problem was using ternaries on a list, python doesn't interpret that element wise. However it does interpret normal conditionals in that way so there was no need for a ternary and it works now.

     I also have the same problem when using ternary in lambda function. Could you elaborate on how you fixed it? How did you change from ternary to conditionals there? Thanks
