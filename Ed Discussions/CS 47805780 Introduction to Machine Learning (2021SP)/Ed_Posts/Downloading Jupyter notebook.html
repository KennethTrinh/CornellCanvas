 I'm trying to download a full preview of the Jupyter notebook as a pdf, but noticed if you go File -&gt; Download as -&gt; pdf via LaTeX, it only converts up to 5 pages. I'm wondering if there are other ways to download it, so I can save it  on my laptop. Thanks!

  A tried-and-true method, though unfortunately clunky, is to download a Jupyter notebook as an HTML file, then open it, and finally save that HTML file as a PDF. Note that excessive outputs will show in their entirety, so make sure you clean up beforehand!
