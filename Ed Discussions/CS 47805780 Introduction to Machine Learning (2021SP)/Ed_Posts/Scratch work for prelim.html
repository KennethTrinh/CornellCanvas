  Can we have a few pieces of blank paper with us for scratch work for this prelim as well as any future exams? If so, do we need to submit this scratch work with our answers?

  Yes, using scratch paper is fine. Just no electronic devices. No need to submit the scratch paper, but make sure all the steps of your solution are on the answer sheet, so we can give you credit for them.
