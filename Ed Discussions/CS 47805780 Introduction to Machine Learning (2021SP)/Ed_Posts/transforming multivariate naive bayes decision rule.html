  How did we get from the argmax of the logs to the sign function? That is, how did we know to turn the probabilities into those specific ratios of probabilities?

  If you think about the ratio of the probabilities, if $P(Y = 1 | X = x)$ is greater than $P(Y = -1 | X = x)$, then the ratio $\frac{P(Y = 1 | X = x)}{P(Y = -1 | X = x)}$ will be &gt; 1. That means that the log ratio will be greater than 0 (since log of values greater than 1 is positive and less than 1 is negative).

  So, instead of doing an argmax over both y values, you can just look at the sign of the log ratio. To derive it yourself, I would start with:
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  \frac{P\left(Y=1\right)\prod_{i=1}^NP\left(X_i=x_i\left|Y=1\right|\right)}{P\left(Y=-1\right)\prod_{i=1}^NP\left(X_i=x_i\left|Y=-1\right|\right)}
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  Then take the log using the log rule that $log(ab) = log(a) + log(b)$ to get the final result (note that you could take the log ratios and separate them out using the identity $log(\frac{a}{b}) = log(a) - log(b)$ if you wanted to).
