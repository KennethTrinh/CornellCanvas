 I don't understand why yi(w,xi) (a predicted value) equal to the real value scaled by a number.

  This comes from section 9.1.1 of the reading, correct? There are two predicted values here. First is yt(w', xi), where w' is an arbitrary weight vector, and yt(w*, xt), where w* is a specific consistent weight vector that has a norm of 1 and has a geometric margin of gamma. We set w' = w*/gamma, so this is just saying that once we have a solution from the LP, we can scale it to match the assumed solution of w*.
