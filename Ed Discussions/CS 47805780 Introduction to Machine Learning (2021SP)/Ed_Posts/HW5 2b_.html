 This question asks us to compare our running time with that of a brute-force algorithm considering all possible English word sequences. I'm a little confused as to how this would work. If we were using a HMM without the Viterbi algorithm, wouldn't we need to consider all possible sequences of POS instead, since we need to find the max $y \in Y$?

  You would need to assign both POS and words

   Wouldn't the brute-force approach try every possible POS sequence with the same length as the number of words doing the probability calculations and find the max? I guess I don't see why you would need to assign words, aren't they the input to the prediction?

    Looks like #1051 suggests what you're saying
