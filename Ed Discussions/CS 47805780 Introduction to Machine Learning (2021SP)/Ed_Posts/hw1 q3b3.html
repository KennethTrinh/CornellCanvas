  In the hint part of the last question, it says that we should use the root feature selected in ii). Is it referring to the first selected node using entropy as the rule? Also, in order to draw a complete tree, do we still need to calculate entropy for the second node or not?

  It is referring to selecting the feature that maximizes information gain (equation given in question). In part ii, you will have calculated the values of the information gain for each of the possible choices of root feature. In part iii, you just want to draw the tree with the root feature being whichever feature had the largest information gain in part ii.
