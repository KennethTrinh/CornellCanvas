  Howdy y'all, the folks at My Course Index are partnering with our course to offer you all a new tool and wanted to post the following blurb.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Hate the poor search functionality of Edstem?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Trying to find where a homework concept was introduced in lecture but hate clicking through a million zoom videos to find it?

 <paragraph>
  MCI is a tool from Cornell Data Science that allows you to search all of EdStem, lecture videos, and slides posted on Canvas without the hassle. This puts the entire course at the tip of your fingers and should make finding clarifications, and explanations faster to find.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Give it a try and the team would appreciate any feedback as well! Theyâ€™ll be releasing anonymous feedback forms soon within the website.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  You should all have an account, but if there are any bugs or issues (or general feedback!) please put them in this thread.
