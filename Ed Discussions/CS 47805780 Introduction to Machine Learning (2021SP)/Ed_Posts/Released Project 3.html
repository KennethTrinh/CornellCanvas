  Hi everyone,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Project 3 is now released on Vocareum.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  This project is due April 2nd, 11:59PM, and is an individual project. There is no late submission allowed.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If you have any questions, feel free to reply to this post or create a new question on Ed Discussion. Below is an FAQ that we will update as questions pop up.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Please start this project early. Some of the formulas can be confusing, so it would likely serve you well to get a head start.

    The equation "yi (∑αi yi k(xi,x) + b)=1" is somewhat confusing, since there are in fact two different indices. A more clear equation would be "yi (∑αj yj k(xi,x) + b)=1".

    Some students have been getting the error "vocSaveDataPublic not found". This is a typo on our part, but should not affect your submission and you can ignore it. If you see this error and are not getting full points, it is likely due to some other issue like timeout. Sorry for the confusion.

  What does it mean that we have a 5 minute time limit for the competition part of the project? Does this mean that we have 5 minutes of computing time to get a good score, and if we don't then we just don't get those points?

  5 minute time limit means you have 5 total minutes for your submission to run in Vocareum. If your submission runs for longer than 5 minutes, you will get a timeout and receive 0 points.

  If we get a 0 after submitting, are we allowed to resubmit like in past problem sets to try and improve?

  Regarding the first clarification, I believe the kernel term should be:
 </paragraph>
 <heading level="2">
  k(xi,x)
 </heading>
 <paragraph>
  rather than
 </paragraph>
 <heading level="2">
  k(xj,x)
 </heading>
 <paragraph>
  as is there. Is this correct?
