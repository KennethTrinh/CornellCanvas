  Here, v is intended to be the component of x that's normal the the hyperplane, whereas (w*x+b)w is the component that's in the hyperplane. Intuitively what's going on here is that (w*v) measures the similarity between the plane and the vector (since ||w||=1), and b is a constant offset. So, (w*x+b)w ends up being a projection of x onto the hyperplane defined by w and b, and v is what's left over.
