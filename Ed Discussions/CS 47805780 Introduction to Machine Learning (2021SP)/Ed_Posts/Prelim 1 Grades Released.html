 We graded Prelim 1 last night, and overall you did very well. On the questions that test some of the most essential concepts in ML, most got full marks. And even on some of the harder questions most of you managed to get some of the key steps. So, I just released the grades on Gradescope, and how you did on the exam should give you a good idea of the depth of your understanding. The questions and the solutions are in the "Prelim 1" module on Canvas. Please make sure that understand the solution wherever you have not gotten full points.

 The maximum score is 100, the median score is 83, the mean is 81, and the standard deviation is 11. The typical grading scale (see FAQ on Canvas) mapping scores to letter grades should help you understand your numeric score. Note that the weight of Prelim 1 on your final grade is only 5% of your final course grade (same as a single homework), but it should give you a pretty good idea how well you may fare on Prelim 2 (weighted at 35%) if you continue your current study habits.

 The deadline for submitting regrade requests is April 9.
