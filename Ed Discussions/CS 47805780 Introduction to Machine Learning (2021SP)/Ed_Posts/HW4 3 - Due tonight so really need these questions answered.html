 Reposting questions I posted below that were left unanswered. The homework is due in a few hours, so I could really use some help with these.
</p>
<p>
 3a: HW4 3a - hidden layer fully connected to output layer?
</p>
<p>
 I know that the flattened input of size D is fully connected to the hidden layer of size D; is the hidden layer fully connected to the output layer of size C?
</p>
<p>
 For 3cii:

<p>
 Do we need to show work for 3cii? If so what sort of work should we show? Seems like any attempt to show work would get really out of hand in terms of how much it would require you to writeâ€”the only reasonable idea I had was to provide the NumPy code I used to calculate the answer. I lost point on the last HW for not showing work on a similar question without it being expressly asked for, so just wanted to make sure.
</p>
<p>
 Also I've seen some other threads mentioning something about "flipping the filter." What does this mean and do we need to do it? If so how?

  Yes, the hidden layer is fully connected to the output layer.
 </p>
 <p>
  For 3cii, explain how you got your answer, but there's no need to fully show work on every calculation.
