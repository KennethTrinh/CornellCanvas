 In last week's discussion, L2's norm is given as the square root of (sum of wi^2). However, on lecture 11's slides, L2's norm is given as the dot product of w and itself (without the square root). Am I overlooking something here?

  The l2 norm should contain the square root; it's common to use the
  <i>
   squared
  </i>
  l2 norm as a regularizer.
