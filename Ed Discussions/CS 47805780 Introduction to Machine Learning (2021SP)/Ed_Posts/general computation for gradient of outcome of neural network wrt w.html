 Above, we are given the general formula for computing D_{l+1}.
</p>
<p>
 When we're computing D_d, are we just setting {l+1} equal to d? Because, in that case, I don't understand how we got D_d = sigma'(s_d) from using the given formula for D_{l+1}?
</p>
<p>
 Also, I don't quite understand how we got the expression for D_l using the given formula for D_{l+1}?
</p>

  So the update rule for D_d is:
 </p>
 <math>
  D_{\left(d-1\right)+1}=D_d=J_{s_d}\left(v_d\right)\ \Pi_{i=d-1}^dJ_{v_i}\left(s_{i+1}\right)J_{s_i}\left(v_i\right)
 </math>
 <p>
  The Pi product doesn't do anything because in the way the formula is presented, i is a
  <i>
   decreasing
  </i>
  variable starting at d-1 and going to dl+1=d But, because d &gt; d-1, there are no terms in the product.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, we have:
 </p>
 <math>
  D_d=J_{s_d}\left(v_d\right)=\sigma'\left(s_d\right)
 </math>
 <p>
  Assuming there is only one output neuron in the final layer (otherwise we would need a diagonal matrix).
