 What is the difference between multinomial and multivariate naive bayes? It seems to me that both do the same thing.

  The multinomial naive Bayes assumption is used specifically in the case that the input is a sequence (text classification in the lecture examples) whereas multivariate naive Bayes is used when the input is a feature vector. The Laplace estimator is slightly different for the two classifiers.
