  For (c), we can transform the summation as follows:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  $$\Sigma_{i=1}^{d}(x_{i} - 1) \lt0$$
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  $$\Sigma_{i=1}^{d}x_{i} - \Sigma_{i=1}^{d}1\lt0$$
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  $$\Sigma_{i=1}^{d}x_{i} - d \lt 0$$
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Since this is for the $+1$ case, we need to flip the inequality to get it in proper form. We can do so by multiplying both sides by $-1$:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  $$\Sigma_{i=1}^{d}(-x_{i}) + d \gt 0$$
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Now you can see why $b=d$. The last thing to figure out is how to obtain the sum of $-x_{i}$ using $w$. By setting $\vec{w} = (-1,-1,...)$ you find that $$\vec{w} \cdot \vec{x} = \Sigma_{i=1}^{d}(-x_{i}) $$
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Finally, you can rewrite $f_{M}(\vec{x})$ as $sign(\vec{w} \cdot \vec{x} + b)$.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  As for (d), it's a similar process.
