 Are we supposed to use 1 or 0 to denote white? In HW4 3c, it says implicitly that 1 stands for black. But in other classes, we are taught to use 1 to be white.
</p>
<p>
 And for convolution, are we supposed to flip the filter first?

  While it is true that a high signal 1 is typically used to denote white, for 3c, go along with how the problem defines it (i.e. let 1 be black).

  For convolution, flip the filter before performing cross correlation operation.
