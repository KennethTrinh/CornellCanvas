 I'm really lost in trying to formulate an objective statement that is DCP compliant. I originally had a naive implementation for calculating the sum of all alpha(i)alpha(j)y(i)y(j)K(i,j) which obviously ran out of memory and now I'm trying to develop the same sum using matrix operations. However, all the statements I come up with involve taking an outer product of the alpha vector and this is not DCP compliant according to cvxpy. Can anyone give me some pointers for how to get past this issue? I'm open to trying alternate methods as well.

  I had a similar issue, and using quadratic form (quad_form on cvxpy) on alpha helped for me.

   Can you expand on that?

    So from the documentation for cvxpy.quad_form(x, P), the function calculates x^T @ P @ x (I am using @ to denote matrix multiplication. Assume vectors are 1xd matrices), where the dimensions of x and P must work out for that matrix multiplication statement.

    I tried using quad_form with alpha and the identity matrix but I'm still getting an error that says it's not DCP compliant.

     Try putting the y,K terms into the matrix instead of using the identity matrix.

      How were you able to incorporate alpha into the objective after quad_form(y, K)?

       I rather did quad_form(alpha,X), and have matrix X contain all the information for y,K. Apparently its harder to pass the DCP compliant condition if we build up our own expression using @, but quad_form(variant, constants) is judged as 'convex' and passes the DCP compliant condition.

        How do you construct X?
