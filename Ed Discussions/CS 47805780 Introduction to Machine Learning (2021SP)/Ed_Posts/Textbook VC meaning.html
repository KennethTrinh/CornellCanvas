  VC stands for Vapnikâ€“Chervonenkis.

  To define this quantity, first it is important to discuss "shattering."
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  A set of instances $S$ is said to be shattered by the hypothesis space $\mathcal{H}$ if and only if for every pair of disjoint subsets of $S$, whose union is $S$, there exists some $h \in \mathcal{H}$ that is consistent with the disjoint subsets. To be more explicit, for all $S_1,S_2 \subset S$ where $S_1 \cup S_2 = S$, there exists an $h \in H$ such that all the elements of $S_1$ are classified as "positive" and all the elements of $S_2$ are classified as "negative."
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Now, we can talk about VC dimension. The VC dimension of a hypothesis space $\mathcal{H}$ defined over the instance space $X$ is the size of the largest finite subset of $X$ that is shattered by $\mathcal{H}$. This quantity can be infinite if arbitrarily large subsets of $X$ can be shattered by $\mathcal{H}$.
