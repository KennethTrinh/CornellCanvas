  I got an error for my l2distance saying that "distance from a vector to itself is not zero." I'm a little confused as to what that means? Shouldn't this distance by zero since it's in the same location? My code produces a zero for these instances, so I'm not really sure how to interpret. Thanks.

  The error is saying that one of our test cases which checked the distance from a vector to itself (which should be 0) failed. I'd recommend going back through every line to make sure there aren't any strange zero errors anywhere.

  I can't really give more help without knowing more information, so if you still have the problem, definitely come to office hours!
