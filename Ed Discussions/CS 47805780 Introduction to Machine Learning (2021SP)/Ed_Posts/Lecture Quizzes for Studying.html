 Can the lecture quizzes be posted/made available again for studying purposes?

  You should be able to see all the quizzes and the correct answers for the quizzes that you attempted. Is that not true? For quizzes that you did not try, Canvas is a pain and does not let me make them public without also opening submissions again.

   That was my issue, thank you. My test samples were the first two quizzes, which also happened to be the only two I missed.!
