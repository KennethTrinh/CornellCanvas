  Do we need to divide our probability by $P(X=x)$? We did it in discussion but not in lecture, and we can technically classify without knowing it since it will be the same for both Y=+-1.

  The question explicitly asks you to compute $P(Y=y|X=x)$, so it is the safest to compute and divide by $P(X = x)$ anyway.
