 I'm reading over this question, and I think I'm still confused as to what it is actually getting out. Could someone help explain what VS(H,S U (x,y)) C VS(H,S) means in words? Is this saying that by adding a negative close to the other negative, this ensures that the x value is within S? I guess I'm confused as to how VS(H,S U (x,y)) is actually different than  VS(H,S).

  S U (x,y)) = S with the new example (x, y) added to it
 </p>
 <p>
  VS(H,S U (x,y)) = the version space with S with the new example (x, y) added to it
 </p>
 <p>
  VS(H,S U (x,y)) C VS(H, S) =  the version space with S with the new example (x, y) added to it is a subset of the old version space, before (x, y) was added
 </p>
 <p>
  If you add the right (x, y) to S, you can restrict the version space a lot. For example, if you only had positive (x, y)s before, the version space includes any hypothesis that forms a circle that surrounds all those points, no matter how big that circle is. But if you add a negative (x, y) farther away, now the version space can only include circles that surround all the positive points but does not include the negative one. That limits it a lot from what it was before.
