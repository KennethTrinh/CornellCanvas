 It says that we can use the soft-margin SVM equations to solve for the slack variables, but the only equations we have are the constraints that are inequalities. Are we expected to solve for an exact value for the slack variables or can we just provide a range that the slack variables can be in?

  Here is the equation for the slack variable:

 <math>
  \xi_i=\max(0,1-y_i(\vec{w}\cdot \vec{x_i}+b))
