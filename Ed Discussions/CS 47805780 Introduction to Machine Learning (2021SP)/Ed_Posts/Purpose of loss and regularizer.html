  I think the purpose of regularizer is to prevent overfitting and that of loss is to prevent underfitting by penalising training errors. Correct me if i'm wrong?

  A decent way of thinking about it for regularizers, the loss as a means to avoid underfitting is a bit of an odd formulation but it holds.
