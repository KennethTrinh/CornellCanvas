  For the perceptron function in P2, I am able to pass all the test cases when submitting the project. However, I still sometimes fail on the assertion below (sometimes pass, sometimes fail). Is it because there is an error in my code? Or is it because max_iter=100 is too small for w to be updated to the correct value?

  It is likely that the occasional fail is a result of the random shuffling in the perceptron algorithm. If you're usually passing and occasionally failing, you shouldn't have to worry about it.
