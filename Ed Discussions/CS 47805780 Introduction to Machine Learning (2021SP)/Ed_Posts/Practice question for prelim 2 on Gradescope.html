 Could the "practice prelim 2 questions" on Gradescope be made always accessible so that we could test our internet configurations against it? I tried to open it during the mock and realized that I would probably need to turn on my VPN to load the questions. But after I quit the lockdown browser to change the configuration I was not able to test it again, which I think I should do to make everything safe.

  I have the same issue, I'm trying to check my setup using an external camera instead of my inbuilt camera but I can't seem to access the practice prelim again

  I deleted you "submission", so now you can try again.
