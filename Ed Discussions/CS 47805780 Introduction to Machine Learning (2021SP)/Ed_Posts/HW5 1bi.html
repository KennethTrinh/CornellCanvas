  For the example that we are trying to classify, is each Xi not independent? Cuz it seems that the probability of Pr(X = (0,1,1)) I got by simply multiplying P(X1=0), P(X2=1), P(X3=1) is different from the result I got using the law of total probability, i.e. P(X = (0,1,1)) = P(X=(0,1,1), Y=-1)+P(X=(0,1,1),Y=1).

  The problem description for 1bi, when it states that the points are independent, is only describing an assumption of the naive bayes classifier, which may or may not be an accurate assumption.

  So to clarify, the probability of Xi given Y is independent doesn't necessarily mean that Xi is also independent?

  Yes, conditional independence and independence are distinct things.
