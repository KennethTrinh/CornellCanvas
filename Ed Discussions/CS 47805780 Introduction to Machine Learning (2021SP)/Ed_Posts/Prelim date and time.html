 When will the prelim take place? Also for those who are in different time zones will the prelim be accommodated?

  Take a look at the video and/or slides from the intro lecture, and I also added this info to the FAQ. In short, Prelim 1 is take home, so no issue there. For Prelim 2, we will follow university policy regarding time zones.
