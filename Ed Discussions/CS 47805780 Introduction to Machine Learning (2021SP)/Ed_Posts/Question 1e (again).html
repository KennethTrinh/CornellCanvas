 Hi I have a question about 1e that was touched upon before.
 <break>

 The question states that the Hypothesis space includes the sum of two attributes to make a prediction. Does that not mean there are infinite functions then? Like if I do A + B &gt; x or A + B = x, where x is a real number. Or am I limited to just when the result is 0.

  1 (e) asks you to follow the formatting of h_1; i.e. only consider hypotheses where x = 0
