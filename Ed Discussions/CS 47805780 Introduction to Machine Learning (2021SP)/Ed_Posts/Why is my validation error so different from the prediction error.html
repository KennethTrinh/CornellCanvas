  Just been having a problem where my validation error is like 25% higher than my true error, and I have no idea how to proceed if I can't trust my validation error and I don't want to keep bombing precious kaggle submits just to get an idea of where I actually am. If anyone could give some advice that would be much appreciated.

  I'm also having this issue. I tried using cross validation with k=100, but that didn't seem to help

  My understanding is that some of the features that really help the training set aren't as helpful on the test set (e.g., time). I was able to get a better understanding of the data by graphing some of the features in the test and train and seeing potential areas that the two don't overlap or do.

  Also, because this dataset is so small, I would test using a smaller k, like 5 so that you don't overfit on the data (I know you said it doesn't really matter, but this should be helpful in general).

  Also keep in mind how the test examples were sampled from the overall dataset. You probably get a better alignment between test and val, if val is selected in a similar way.

  That is helpful, thanks. Do you mind clarifying what you mean by "graphing the features"?

  Sure! So for instance, the assignment starts with a line graph of the hospital occupancy by time for each country. You could theoretically create this for the test/train on the different features in the dataset.
