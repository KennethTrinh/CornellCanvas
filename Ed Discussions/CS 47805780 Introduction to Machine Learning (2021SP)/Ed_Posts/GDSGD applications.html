 Is GD and SGD also used for maximization problems or only minimization problems (like we have seen)?
</p>
<p>
 What other applications do GD and SGD have, besides minimization of convex functions as we've learned?

  It can be used for any instance where you have a likelihood you'd like to maximize or a risk you'd like to minimize.  Minimizing the objective is the same as maximizing the negative of it, and you can test this in the project.
