 Should we provide a confidence interval in terms of the sample error, alpha and epislon? Or is it sample error, alpha and sample size n?

  The latter if you're talking about 1b (since you define epsilon by some of the terms you mentioned), but I'm bit confused if that's the question you're talking about though.
