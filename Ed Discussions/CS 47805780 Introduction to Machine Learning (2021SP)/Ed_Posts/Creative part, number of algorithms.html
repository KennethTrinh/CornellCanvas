 Do we still need to have two algorithms for the creative part? Also I wonder do we need to train two results, one using features choosing from train_creative_t_value, one using  features choosing from train_creative? Or can we choose features from both of them and train to get a result.

  The two algorithm requirement is just for the baseline solution (i.e. not necessary for the creative part, but could be useful).

  From the handout, in the section describing train_creative_t_values:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  This is a lot of data so feel to use any number of these columns to improve your prediction.
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  You do not need to produce two separate sets of predictions based on separate training for each of those csvs. The data in train_creative_t_values is not strictly necessary for producing your creative result, but could definitely improve your model.
