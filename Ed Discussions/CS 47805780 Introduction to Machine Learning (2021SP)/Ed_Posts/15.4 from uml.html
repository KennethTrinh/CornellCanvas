<p>
 Why does the coefficient of |w|^2 go from 1 to 1/2 here. Thanks

  If you think about it, we're really minimizing the same equation whether the 1/2 is there or not. The $||\mathbf{w}||$ is a separate term, so the value that minimizes it for a coefficient of 1 will be the same as the value minimizing it for 1/2.

  The reason we multiply by 1/2, then, is to make calculations later on more convenient. (For example, taking a derivative can help us eliminate having a coefficient at all).
