 For the projects, the 1 percentage point reduction per 24 hour period does NOT apply to the 7 "free" late days, correct? I.e. if I haven't used any of my slip days and submit within 24 hours late of the deadline, I can still earn a 100%? (and not 99%) Just wanted to clarify.

  The 1 percentage point reduction only applies if you have already used all of your late days for the projects, but then still turn in a project late.
