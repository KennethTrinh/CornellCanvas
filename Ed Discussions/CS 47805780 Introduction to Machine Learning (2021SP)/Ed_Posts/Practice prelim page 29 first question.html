 The first question on page 29 of the practice prelim says that we will model the word count features with a multinomial distribution. I'm having a little trouble understanding how word count fits the multinomial distribution, since it isn't really a sequence like the instances for a text classification problem would be.

  The sentences were generated in a sequence, we just don't have it represented in that format.

   So word counts [3, 2] mean we see word 1 3 times and word 2 2 times?
   <break>
   </break>
   <break>
   </break>
   And so the probability of seeing it given class y would be, P(W = w1 | y)^3 * P(W = w2 | y)^2?
