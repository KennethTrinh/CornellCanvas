 What would be sequence examples of these?
</p>
<p>
 1. I don't really know how to do one at all?
</p>
<p>
 2. For this one could we do something like in discussion where we choose n=8 values and then show that the depth of a decision tree is 3, so the algorithm is tight in the sense of log2(8)=3?

    These are the first two questions in UML in chapter 21, professor said they would be good to know. And I'm struggling to come up with a solution.

  1. Consistent starts considering the whole hypothesis space and constrains it after each example to what was consistent with the x given at each time step. To make |H|-1 mistakes you must choose every wrong hypothesis before landing on the right one, which means that there is exactly one consistent hypothesis, and only one hypothesis is marked as inconsistent at each time step. Note you can enumerate these for a small |H| since it was not given.
 </p>
 <p>
  2. Similarly for this, you can show the way the space gets halved and how that affects the mistake bound. You have the right idea here.
