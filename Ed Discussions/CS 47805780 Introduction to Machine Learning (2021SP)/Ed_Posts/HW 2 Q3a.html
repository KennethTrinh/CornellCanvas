 On the last row of the table, we put the final weight in the (w0, w1)i column. Since this is the final weight and it classifies everything correctly, do we leave the remaining columns (which are the corresponding xi and yi that were misclassified) blank?

  All rows should be filled out in the table. Keep in mind that you're recording the point that the former weight vector failed on, so the final result should have in each row $w$ (the updated weight vector
  <i>
   after
  </i>
  failing on the $x$ instance listed in the same row), and $x$ (the point that was failed on to yield this new $w$).
