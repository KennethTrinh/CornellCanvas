 Following up on Thread #1394 and TA's answers, I was confused about whether we would be able to train on the
 <underline>
  entire

 training set to obtain predictive models for the classification (baseline) and the regression (creative) tasks?

  Yes, you are definitely allowed to train on the entire training set. What you aren't allowed to do is construct additional features that use future data.
