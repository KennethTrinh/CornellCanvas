  cross validation seems to give me different error matrices every time i run it.  What could be the reason?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Also, to clarify we are computing error as 1 if y != prediction and 0 otherwise and we sum these up and divide by the number of validation examples?

  The training data is randomly generated every time you call spiraldata(), so the error changes between runs.
