  Hello all,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For those planning to take slip days on HW3, note that we will be able to quickly grade any homework submitted before Thursday, March 25 at 5pm.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  In other words, you can continue to submit homeworks up until the late deadline of Friday, March 26 5pm (while consuming your available slip days!) But, our grading session is Thursday, so any homeworks submitted before 5pm then will be part of the "first wave" of grades released.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <bold>
   If you want feedback+grades on your HW3 before the prelim, submit your homework before Thursday, March 25.
  </bold>
  Note that the official no-slip-day deadline is still Tuesday as usual!
