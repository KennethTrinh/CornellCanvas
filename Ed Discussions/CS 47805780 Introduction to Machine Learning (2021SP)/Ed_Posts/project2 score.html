<p>
 just to clarify something on project 2 scoring. What is the VOC_RANK_SCORE? How are we gong to be scored on the competition part? And what's the competition_ungraded score? Is that the accuracy rate or something?
</p>

  You can ignore the VOC_RANK_SCORE.
 </p>
 <p>
  You get 5 points if your perceptron achieves accuracies &gt;97% on the testing data.
 </p>
 <p>
  competition_ungraded is the accuracy of your perceptron on the testing data
