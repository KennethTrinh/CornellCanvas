  This is problem 5 from the first prelim. I'm trying to understand how this problem was meant to be solved. How were the weights chosen for each feature and how was the length of the weight vector calculated?

  The weights are chosen from the description of the 20 "relevant" features, where at least 5 are 1 when positive and at most 1 is 1 when negative. You then choose a value such that those are all equal and positive (i.e. 1), and then choose whichever b maximizes the margin (in this case -3, since 3 is halfway between 1 and 5, w/ 1-3=-2 and 5-3=+2 centered around 0). The length of the weight vector is then calculated as the euclidian length, sqrt(20*1^2+3^2)=sqrt(29). Now the geometric margin is the functional margin (or min absolute value of w(wx+b)), 2, divided by the euclidian length of the weight vector, sqrt(29). We can then use that and our value of R to calculate our mistake bound.
