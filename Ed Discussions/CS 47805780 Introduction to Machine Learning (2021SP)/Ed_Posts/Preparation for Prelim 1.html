 As you already know, Prelim 1 is coming up in about a week. Here are some details about the Prelim 1 itself, as well as some resources and advice on how you can prepare.
</p>
<p>
 Prelim 1 is taken online via Gradescope, and you can pick any time between
</p>
<p>
 Monday, March 29, 8:00am (Ithaca time) and Tuesday, March 30, 2:59pm (Ithaca time).
</p>
<p>
 This is a timed exam, that is once you have started the exam, you have 90 minutes to solve the questions and write your answers. You then have an additional 10 minutes to scan and upload your answers. If you have SDS accommodation for additional time for exam taking, you will receive additional time. Note that the latest time to upload your answers is March 30, 2:59pm - so make sure you start your exam early enough!
</p>
<p>
 You will need pen, paper, and access to a scanner (or a scanning app on your phone) to complete and upload the exam. You will write your answers on an answer sheet that you will need to print a few days before the exam. Detailed instructions on where to download the answer sheet and the exam, and how to submit answers will follow (including accommodations for students that cannot follow this process).

 The main goal of Prelim 1 is to help you assess how well you understand the material, and how well you would be doing on Prelim 2 if it were held today. We therefore made the conditions of Prelim 1 as similar as possible to Prelim 2. In particular, you are not allowed to use outside help of any form (including, but not limited to books, Google, other people). However, you are allowed to create a 1-page single-sided "cheat sheet" before the prelim that you can consult during the exam. It is an academic integrity violation to share any information about prelim questions or your answers with anybody else, or to accept any such information in any form.

 To give you a bit of a break, we only have one new lecture module this week, and this module is not covered in Prelim 1. The prelim covers the material in Lectures 1-11 (i.e. up to and including Regularized Linear Models), as well as the associated readings. Also make sure you really understood Homeworks 1-3 and Projects 1-3.

 To prepare for Prelim 1, I posted a collection of old exam questions in the Canvas Module called Prelim 1. Since the content of the class changes from year to year, not all questions are perfectly aligned with the current course. But I picked the ones that are the best match. We do not post solutions, since solving the questions on your own is a much better preparation. However, I will be holding a review session on
</p>
<p>
 Friday at 9:00am (Zoom https://cornell.zoom.us/j/94908400712?pwd=NWJvU1g1QVYvSmt2SlZWWFBsd3J4QT09 )
</p>
<p>
 to go over the questions and their answers. The session will be recorded. Also, come to office hours with any open questions you may have, and we are happy to go over the material again.
