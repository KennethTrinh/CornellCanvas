  Hi all! For those of you who prefer in-person interactions: I'll be holding
  <bold>
   in-person office hours
  </bold>
  every 2 weeks on
  <bold>
   Monday 3-5pm
  </bold>
  in
  <bold>
   Rhodes 406
  </bold>
  before each homework is due. No appointment/scheduling is needed, so feel free to drop by any time during my OH. Due to Cornell policies, however, there is a limit of 4 people in the room, so you may need to wait outside the room if the room has reached its limit. I will also be using QueueMeIn so make sure to sign in there when you get to Rhodes.
