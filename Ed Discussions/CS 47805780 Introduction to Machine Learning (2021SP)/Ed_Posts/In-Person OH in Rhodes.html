 Hi all! For those of you who prefer in-person interactions: I'll be holding
 <b>
  in-person office hours
 </b>
 every 2 weeks on
 <b>
  Monday 3-5pm
 </b>
 in
 <b>
  Rhodes 406
 </b>
 before each homework is due. No appointment/scheduling is needed, so feel free to drop by any time during my OH. Due to Cornell policies, however, there is a limit of 4 people in the room, so you may need to wait outside the room if the room has reached its limit. I will also be using QueueMeIn so make sure to sign in there when you get to Rhodes.
