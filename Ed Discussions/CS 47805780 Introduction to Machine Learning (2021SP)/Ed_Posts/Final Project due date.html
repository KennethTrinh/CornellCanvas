  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Would it be possible to know when the final project will be due? Is it going to be due during the semester or finals period? Just trying to find a good time for my second dose!

  Thanks

  Tentative plan is to have it due on Thursday, May 13 (with the possibility of a 1 day extension). But this is still tentative!
