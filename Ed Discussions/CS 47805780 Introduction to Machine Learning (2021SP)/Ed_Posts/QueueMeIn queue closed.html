 Hi, it seems like I can't join any queues from QueueMeIn, but the number of people in the queue keeps increasing so it might just be an issue with my account?

  I've reached out to the person who set up our queuemein to see if they might know what's going on. In the meantime, can I verify that you're only trying to add yourself to the queue of an in-progress office hour? OH queues are only available between 30 minutes before they start, and their end time.

   Thank you for doing that! Yes, I'm currently in the zoom call for the OH I was trying to add myself to and was also unable to add myself early to the OH period that just started at 12:30 PM.

    I'm not sure how long it'll be before he's able to respond; if you like I can reach out directly to the TA for the next OH and let them know you were trying to add yourself but couldn't.

  Hey Anonymous, could you make a new private post without anonymous so I can verify maybe what's going wrong with your account? I suspect something might be weird with your enrollment in the queue me in database.
