 Do we have to draw the KNN decision boundary by hand? Or we can use python (the code from the project) to draw it? Thanks!

  You do not need to hand draw the KNN decision boundary. The method in which you choose to depict it is upon to you. As long as it is clear what your answer is and it is correct, points will be awarded
