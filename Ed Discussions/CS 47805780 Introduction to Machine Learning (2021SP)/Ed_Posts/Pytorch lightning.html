 Can we use the Pytorch Lightning module for p5? It makes development a lot easier.

  You can use Pytorch Lightning but I don't think it will actually make development that much easier given the amount of bookkeeping you ~really need for this project.

   Oh, what exactly do you mean by bookkeeping and why do you think it won't help?

    As far as I remember, Lightning is OP when it comes to
   </p>
   <p>
    Run distributed training
    <break>
    </break>
    Logging
    <break>
    </break>
    Metrics
    <break>
    </break>
    Visualization
    <break>
    </break>
    Early stopping
   </p>
   <p>
    For other things like simple models, scikitlearn will have you covered.
   </p>

     To add to Victor's answer, be judicious with your time! Something like
     <a href="https://www.pytorchlightning.ai">
      PyTorch lightning
     </a>
     is very likely overkill for this project (our datasets are small, we don't require lots of fancy compute, your chosen ML algorithms will probably not be too complicated).
    </p>
    <p>
     However, if you think you have the time and the inclination to learn a new development API, then this project is a good chance to try it out.

      Yes thank you. My ML research actually required me to work with pt lightning so I was trying to use this to gain some experience.
