  Can we use the Pytorch Lightning module for p5? It makes development a lot easier.

  You can use Pytorch Lightning but I don't think it will actually make development that much easier given the amount of bookkeeping you ~really need for this project.

  Oh, what exactly do you mean by bookkeeping and why do you think it won't help?

  To add to Victor's answer, be judicious with your time! Something like
  <link href="https://www.pytorchlightning.ai"/>
  PyTorch lightning is very likely overkill for this project (our datasets are small, we don't require lots of fancy compute, your chosen ML algorithms will probably not be too complicated).

  However, if you think you have the time and the inclination to learn a new development API, then this project is a good chance to try it out.

  Yes thank you. My ML research actually required me to work with pt lightning so I was trying to use this to gain some experience.

  As far as I remember, Lightning is OP when it comes to

  For other things like simple models, scikitlearn will have you covered.
