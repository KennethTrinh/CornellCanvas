 When we say the margin for support vectors(hard) is 1. Are we talking about functional margin or geometric margin?

  I believe that's functional margin, though I could be mistaken. Geometric margin if I recall correctly is just the orthogonal euclidean distance between the nearest point and the hyperplane, which could vary depending on the dataset.
