  This was the perceptron algorithm posted on the slides. I realized that if any of the x inputs are a 0 vector, then y_i ( w(t) * x(i)) is always 0 no matter the value of w(t). Hence, updating w(t) will not cause the algorithm to end even though there may be a solution. Am I missing something? Is it that the homogenous case will never allow x(i) to be the 0 vector as the last entry in the vector must be 1?

  Yes, we assume there's some kind of bias term $b$ that's always going to be added in $w \cdot x$, so there won't be any issues with the 0 vector. As you said, that bias term often takes the form of the last element in $w$, so the 0 $x$ vector is actually $[0, 0, 0, ... 0, 1]$.
