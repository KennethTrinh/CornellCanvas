  Does anyone know where is the web form for automatic matching of finding partners? I remember that the professor mentioned that in class, but I cannot find that web form now.

  The matching surveys will come out a bit before each homework does, so you can get a new match for each assignment if you would like. For homework 1, the form will come out on Monday as a post on Ed.
