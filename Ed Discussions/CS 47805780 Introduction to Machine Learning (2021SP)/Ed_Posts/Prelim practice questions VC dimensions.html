  On page 18, the VC dimension question is not actually a homework question right? We can get help with it during office hours?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  On this note, is it possible for the VC dimension to be infinite? It seems that could be the case here...
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I see this is mentioned in Lecture 16c but all that is said is that "we cannot learn when the VC dimension is infinite" which I don't really know how to interpret.

  I think the VC dimension is 3. Because a set of 4 points arranged in to form of a positive triangle with a negative point in the middle can be shattered. So I believe the VC dimension is 3.

  I understand VC dimension to only require
  <bold>
   one

  configuration of 4 points to be shattered by the convex polygon, not all possible configurations of 4 points. If that is correct, a rectangle can shatter a diamond configuration of 4 points, and a rectangle is a convex polygon.

  Further, if you can arrange an infinite number of points on the unit circle, then any shape with vertices at these points is a convex polygon. If even one of these configurations of an infinite number of points is shattered,

  the VC dimension is infinite.

  This infinite collection of points doesn't need to have a point at the center, which, as you pointed out, would prevent the set from being shattered by a convex polygon. But a set of infinite points does exist (the unit circle configuration described above) that is shattered. From my understanding, if this is true, the VC dimension is infinite.
