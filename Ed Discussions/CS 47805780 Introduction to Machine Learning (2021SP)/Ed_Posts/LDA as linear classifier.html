 I don't quite understand how we got from the final form of our LDA classification rule to the linear rule.
</p>
<p>
 How do we know weight vector w = mu_(+) - mu_(-)?
</p>
<p>
 How do we know bias term b is expressed as it says on the slide above?

  Basically, w=mu_(+)-mu_(-) because the more you move in the direction of mu_(+) the more positive your objective should be, and vice versa. the bias term is as it is such that the objective is exactly 0 halfway between mu_(+) and mu_(-), since by our LDA description that's where the probabilities of being in each class should be equal.
