  For the naivebayesPXY_mle function, we have to compute "probability vectors for all features given a class label." I am a bit confused because our training instances (each word), may contain multiple occurrences of each letter, and therefore our features are not binary.

  How do we assign a single probability to each feature (given the class label) when each feature can take on a range of values? Are we just computing the probabilities that a given letter is present within a word given the class of the word?

  Resolved - seems that we are just computing the probability that a letter is present within a word given the class.
