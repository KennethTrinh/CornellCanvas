  Here are some additional logistics for Prelim 2. I already talked about what is covered in the exam in my post last week. To repeat, it will cover all lectures that have been released by the time of the exam, their associated reading, the discussion sections, homeworks 1-5, and projects 1-5. This means that the exam is cumulative, and it will cover the whole semester -- not just what we did since Prelim 1. The type of exam questions will be similar to those on Prelim 1, and you can now use a two-sided cheat sheet. There will be no additional new material coming out this Friday, or any other time before Prelim 2.

  If you are taking Prelim 2 in-person, we will let you know which room you are in, and when you should be arriving in this room. It is important to arrive at the given time to avoid last-minute crowding and maintain social distancing. The exam starts at 6:30pm and you have 2.5 hours. We will be handing out a paper exam for you to write on. All you need is a pen and your cheat sheet. You can bring a calculator, although you do not really need one.

  If you are taking Prelim 2 remotely, see the detailed instructions posted on Canvas. In particular, you will get a zoom link for your proctored exam session. In addition, you will have to attend one of the "mock-exam" sessions early next week. Lacy already sent out sign-up sheets where you can pick your session. These mock exams will help you debug any computer issues you may have. If you do not participate in any of the mock sessions, any computer issues during the actual exam are on you. Like the in-person exam, the remote exam starts at 6:30pm Ithaca time. However, there is also an alternative session at 8:30pm Ithaca time to accommodate more time zones. Please respond to the survey you received. In either case, you have 2.5 hours to answer the question, just like in the in-person exam. A calculator is provided as part of the lockdown browser. You will need to hand-write your answers on a answer sheet, similar to Prelim 1.

  If you have SDS accommodation for extra time in either the in-person or the remote exam, you will receive a personal message with your start time (which will typically be earlier than the normal exam start at 6:30pm).

  Remember that practice questions for the exam are on Canvas, and that I will be holding a review session on Wednesday (see earlier post). The review session will be recorded and posted on Canvas ASAP.

  The blank answer sheet is for students taking the exam remotely is now available on Canvas. If you are taking the exam remotely, please print (or manually create a paper-based answer sheet with the same layout) and have it ready for your exam to write on. If you are taking the exam in-person, you do not need this answer sheet.
