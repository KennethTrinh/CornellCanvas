 What is the intuition behind why (w dot x) is always equal to -b? I understand geometrically that the hyperplane is orthogonal to w, and I understand that (w dot x) would have to equal -b for (w dot x + b = 0) to remain true, but I don't understand how to geometrically interpret the fact that (w dot x)=-b for all vectors x.

   Intuitively speaking, wx=0 is a plane. By chaning w, we can rotate our plane, but it is fixed by the point (0,0). wx=-b is a plane where we shift wx=0 up/down, so its no longer fixed by (0,0) and gives us more options of hyperplane. -b is just convention so it can be expressed as wx+b=0
