 I'm not sure why I keep getting this error anytime I try to run my competition code? Any guidance would be much appreciated.

  Your yTr matrix and the last row of your V matrix probably have different dimensions. Try checking your last weight matrix to make sure it gives output that is the same shape as yTr.
