  <bold>
   Friday, March 26, at 5:00pm
  </bold>
  . This is also when the solutions will be released. Note that the latest time to submit HW3 late is earlier than usual. This is a trade-off between giving you the flexibility to submit late, and being able to release the HW3 grades and solution before the prelim.

   New to this homework
  </bold>
  : from now on, homework submissions that do not mark which page the solution to a problem is on may receive up to a 3 point deduction. Most students already do this; it is a good way to organize your work, and makes it much easier for your graders to go through them!

  For 1(b)(i), it says the formula for the functional margin can be found on page 8 of 08b-svm_primal.pdf but that pdf only has 7 pages. Is this referring to pages 3/4?
