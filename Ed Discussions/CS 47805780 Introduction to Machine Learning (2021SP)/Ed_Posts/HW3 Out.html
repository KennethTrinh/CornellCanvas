 Homework 3 is out. Updates and edits will be logged here.
</p>
<p>
 Please read the header and the questions carefully, and ask any questions/clarifications here on ed!
</p>
<p>
 Note that the due date is
 <b>
  Tuesday, March 23, 2021.
 </b>
 Late assignments can be submitted on Gradescope up to
 <b>
  Friday, March 26, at 5:00pm
 </b>
 . This is also when the solutions will be released. Note that the latest time to submit HW3 late is earlier than usual. This is a trade-off between giving you the flexibility to submit late, and being able to release the HW3 grades and solution before the prelim.

 Reminder: please form your groups on Gradescope before submitting, and please mark where your solutions are on each page.
 <b>
  New to this homework
 </b>
 : from now on, homework submissions that do not mark which page the solution to a problem is on may receive up to a 3 point deduction. Most students already do this; it is a good way to organize your work, and makes it much easier for your graders to go through them!

   For 1(b)(i), it says the formula for the functional margin can be found on page 8 of 08b-svm_primal.pdf but that pdf only has 7 pages. Is this referring to pages 3/4?
