 Professor said in the first lecture that there will be
 <b>
  at most
 </b>
 5 programming projects and 5 written homework. I'm wondering whether this still holds since there are three of both already.

  Yes, you will only do at most 5 programming projects and 5 written homeworks. We take weeks off for the prelim and the final.
