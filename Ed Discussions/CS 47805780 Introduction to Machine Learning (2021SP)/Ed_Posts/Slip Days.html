 Hi, is there a way to check how many slip days we have used. Also what happens if we blow through the 7 allotted days? Would late assignments have a penalty or would late assignments not be accepted?

   oops. should have checked that first. For anyone else with the same query, it is
  </p>
  <p>
   <i>
    Assignments turned in late will be charged a 1 percentage point reduction of the cumulated final homework grade for each period of 24 hours for which the assignment is late.
   </i>
  </p>
  <p>
   Also, the 7-late-day quota is separate for homework assignments and projects.
