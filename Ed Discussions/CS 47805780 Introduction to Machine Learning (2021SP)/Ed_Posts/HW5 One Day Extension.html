  Hey all,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Apologies for the late publication of homework 5 yesterday. To make up for this, you will be allowed to submit your homework up to
  <bold>
   Wednesday, April 21 at 5pm
  </bold>
  without any late day use. This change is reflected on gradescope.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Note that this
  <bold>
   does not change
  </bold>
  the fact that the final late submission day is still Sunday, Apr 25! Additionally, we still strongly recommend you do submit before Thursday, April 22 at 5pm if you do submit late to get on-time grading/feedback.
