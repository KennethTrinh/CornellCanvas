  The notation is a bit confusing here. However, I think that $a$ and $b$ are values within the feature vector $\vec{x}$. In regards to the project, this would be a specific letter within the English alphabet such as "a" or "b". In regards to a bag words, $a$ and $b$ are distinct words within the bag.
