 I thought the mathematical definition of the kernel of a function is the set of elements that map to 0. Is there any connection with that definition?

  IIRC, a kernel is just the center (functional or geographic) of something. For example, the kernel of an operating system is functionally the core of the OS, the kernel of a function is kinda the center I guess, and the ML kernel is really the basis of the classifier. Plus, the popcorn kernel is the center of the popcorn.

   Kernel in this context is related to changing feature maps, and it is distinct from the definition of kernel that you are referring to. One word, two different uses.
