<p>
 For question 3(b.1), when determining which feature splits the dataset as evenly as possible, should we consider the entire dataset at every split, or the narrowed-down dataset (for levels lower than the root of the DT)?
</p>
<p>
 For instance, say I've decided feature A should be the root and have split into branches for "Yes" and "No". To determine what feature I should split on next continuing down the "Feature A = Yes" branch, should I calculate which feature splits the instances with "Feature A = Yes" as evenly as possible or which of the remaining features splits the entire dataset as evenly as possible?

  You only want to consider the data points still in the node you're splitting.
