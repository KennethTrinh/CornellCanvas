  I don't quite understand how to approach this problem; I started with what what we discussed in discussion section and I've kinda just been playing around with where the points are fixed/the labels, but I'm not sure if there is a more efficient and methodical way of approaching it. Any tips or pointers? :')

  Ah! Yep, this question is a little bit tricky to think about, even after solidly understanding VC dimension.

  One tip would be to take a look at the VC dimension of a rectangle (non-rotatable!) These notes are really nice:

  Then, think about nesting the rectangles like in the donut, and shattering all the combined points. Does it work?
