 Are we allowed to typeset the prelim in TeX? Or are we required to handwrite and scan it?

  The prelim will be handwritten and scanned. More details will come very soon!

    Unfortunately, I don't think that will be allowed. Because of the way we are handling Academic Integrity for this exam it makes more sense for everyone to handwrite and scan their answers. More specific details will be out shortly.
