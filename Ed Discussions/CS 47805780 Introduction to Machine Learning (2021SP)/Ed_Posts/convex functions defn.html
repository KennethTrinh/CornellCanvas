 For any two points w1 and w2, is it usually the case that the nonstrict inequality above holds with equality? Or is it usually the case that it is a strict inequality?

  If the function is convex, it holds with &gt;= as seen above. If the function is strictly convex, if holds with &gt; (but every strictly convex function is also convex, so we can use &gt;= if we want).

  Example of strictly convex function: y = x^2

  Example of convex (but not strictly convex) function: y = abs(x)
