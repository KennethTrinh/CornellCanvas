 What is the scope of "Trainable Parameters"?
</p>
<p>
 Would filter parameters be considered "Trainable Parameters"? (They are selected by design which is why I hesitate to include them but clarification would be nice).

  Trainable parameters are anything that are not explicitly set by the person training the NN; for example, the size of a filter is not a trainable parameter but the values in the filter are.
