  Is it okay if we just use a camera app to take pictures of our work and compile it into a pdf on our laptop? These scanning apps kind of freak me out.

  That would be fine, but keep in mind that you only have 10 minutes to submit after you close the exam. Also, you will not be able to use any other applications on your computer in the Lockdown browser. If using your computer is the easiest option then that is fine. Just make sure your work is legible either way.
