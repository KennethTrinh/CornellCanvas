  In the answer b takes on different signs. Doesn't this contradict #272?

  what do you mean by "b takes on different sign"? The solution uses a single definite sign for b.

  Basically what I'm trying to say is that the response to the other question implies that the hyperplane equation should be -x + y = -1

  Ok to answer both questions the idea behind the question is actually to show the difference between the equation of the hyperplane and the classification hypothesis. What we wrote down was to give the equation of the hyperplane in the form: $w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 = b$.
  <break>
  </break>
  We also asked you to give us the weight vector w and the bias b which be used in the form:
  <break>
  </break>
  $Sign(w\cdot x + b)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The difference being that the b in the hyperplane is not the same as the bias in hypothesis class.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Essentially for a point to be classified as +1, if $\overrightarrow{w} = [w_1 , w_2]^T$ then if $w\cdot x + b = w_1 x_1 +w_2 x_2 +b &gt;0$ then it is classified as +1. However, what this equates to is: $w_1 x_1 +w_2 x_2 &gt; -b$ where in this case the b is the bias. Essentially, the b from the equation of the hyperplane is the negative bias. We asked for essentially two different things to show the difference between the two.
  <break>
  </break>
  So if the hyperplane is: $-x + y = 1$, the weight vector and bias should be: $\overrightarrow{w} = [-1, 1]^T, b = -1$
  <break>
  </break>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The idea behind the form is just to tell you how you should write out the equation of the hyperplane and the weight vectors, not the values themselves.
