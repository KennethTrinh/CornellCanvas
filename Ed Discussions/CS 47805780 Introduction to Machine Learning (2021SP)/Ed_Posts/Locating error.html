  I wonder if there is a way to locate where an error is raised, which line specifically. The autograder report is not helpful in that sense.

  The autograder will only tell you which test cases failed, but if you add print lines into your code, the printing will show up on the grading report and you can debug that way (if I remember correctly).

  Although I have already finished and submitted the assignment, from my last attempt to add print statement to the code they did not show up in the report. I could try it again next time.
