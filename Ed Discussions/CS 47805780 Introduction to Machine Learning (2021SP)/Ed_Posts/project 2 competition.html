 For the last part of project 2, I'm kinda confused. Are we supposed to find out own data and import the data? I tried to use the xTr, and yTr provided, but these are simply ndarrays of 1 and 0 instead of webpage files after I printed them out.

  You are not importing your own data. The autograder will pass in the
  <code>
   xTr
  </code>
  and
  <code>
   yTr
  </code>
  , and your
  <code>
   trainspamfiltercomp
  </code>
  will return the w and b of the perceptron.
