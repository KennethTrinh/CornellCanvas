  In the project, a word can have arbitrarily many letters. But the equation for laplace smoothing requires the cardinality of the features to be finite. How are we supposed to reconcile these two facts?

  For Laplace you use $|V|$ which is the size of the vocabulary (in this case 26 since there are 26 letters).

  But in #1050 the slides say that it should be the number of possible values that feature X_i takes. It seems there's two different definitions at hand: the number of features vs the number of values a feature can take. How should we know which ones to use?

  That's the Laplacian estimator for the multivariate Bayes assumption whereas

  is used for the multinomial naive Bayes assumption.
