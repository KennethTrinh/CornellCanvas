  Please remember to fill in midterm TA evaluations! We would greatly appreciate any feedback you can provide our TAs with whom you may have interacted during office hours or discussion sections. If anything is working well or if there are areas in which we can improve, please let us know.

  Seems that there might not be TAs listed for CS 5780 because of a glitch where they didn't cross-reference the TAs from CS 4780. They should fix it soon, thanks for letting me know!

  I asked staff who is responsible for the midterm evaluation, and they told me that there was no midterm evaluation either for the course per se or for the TA.
