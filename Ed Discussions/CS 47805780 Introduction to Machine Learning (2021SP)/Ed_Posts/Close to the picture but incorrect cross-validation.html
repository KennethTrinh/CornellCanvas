  I'm getting something really close to the example picture shown for the cross_validation function, but I'm not passing the autograder. Also passed all the previous test cases. Has anyone else had this issue / is our output supposed to be identical to the picture shown? And does it matter which 0 error hyperparameters our function selects for best C and best lambda?

  If anyone else is having this problem it was caused by using the same set for training and validation!

  Could you explain in more detail? I ran into the same problem: obtained a similar heat map pic but failed in autograder. In cross_validation function, xTr,yTr,xValid,yValid are input. It is impossible to use the same set for training and validation.

  cross_validation(xTr,yTr,xValid,yValid,ktype,CList,lmbdaList)

  My two bugs were returning the index of bestC best lambda instead of the values themselves and then I used the same sets xTr,yTr to train each model as well as compute the error rate when I should have been using xValid yValid.
