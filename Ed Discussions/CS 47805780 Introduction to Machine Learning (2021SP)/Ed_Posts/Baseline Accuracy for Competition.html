 Is the baseline accuracy using the naive implementations given really 97%? I'm confident in my perceptron and it passed all the tests, but copy and pasting the naive implementation and calling perceptron in trainspamfiltercomp gave me an accuracy of 81%. I just want to make sure I'm not doing anything incorrectly.

  Baseline accuracy simply means the threshold we need to beat. Naive implementation would certainly not do that for us.
