  I've found an upper bound on the probability that a monkey "gets lucky", but I'm not sure where to go from here. I assume that, ultimately, we want to show that the probability $P($Tianyu concludes that there is a "good investment opportunity" $|$ all hedge funds are run by monkeys$)$ is lower-bounded by some high value. However, I have no idea how to turn the upper bound that I have into a lower bound for the probability described above. (Although #1064 seems to say that this is possible.)

  Could anyone give me a hint on how to do so? Am I even going in the right direction?

  I know it's a little late now, but what you're trying to do here isn't show that a monkey is likely to get lucky, but rather show that Tianyu can't demonstrate that a monkey wasn't likely to get lucky.
