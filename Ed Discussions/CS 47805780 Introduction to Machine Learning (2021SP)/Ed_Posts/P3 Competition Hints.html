  Can we get any hints/tips on how to approach the competition part? I'm just doing a 70/30 train validation split then looping through to find the best C and lambda from the list given above. However, I'm timing out on submission. Anyone have pointers on how to make the cross_validation faster? Or otherwise optimize efficiency and performance? Thanks!

  Loop to find the best $C$ and $\lambda$ when training, but don't loop while testing. Just use the best $C$ and $\lambda$. That way you don't time out.
