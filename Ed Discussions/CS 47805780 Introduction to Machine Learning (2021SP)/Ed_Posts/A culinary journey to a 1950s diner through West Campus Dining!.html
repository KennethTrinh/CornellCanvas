 Hi all! A friend of mine is putting on a themed dinner on West Campus
 <b>
  <underline>
   next Tuesday
  </underline>
 </b>
 and would like to invite you all to stop by.
</p>
<p>
 As part of the NS 4880, dietetic students work with Cornell Dining to design, plan, and implement a themed dinner event. One of the two themes for this year is Ezraâ€™s Retro Diner. Please see the poster for more information. Thanks!
