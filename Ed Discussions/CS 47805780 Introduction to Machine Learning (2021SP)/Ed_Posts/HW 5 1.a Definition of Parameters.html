 This question asks us how many parameters we need to know. What does it mean by parameters? Is a parameter the probability of a specific feature? Is it the conditional probability of features like P(X1=0|Y=+1)?

  Yes, you're exactly right. It's something like knowing P(Y=-1), or P(X1 | Y = +1) like you've written. Keep in mind which ones you can infer from others easily, to avoid overestimating the # of parameters you need.
