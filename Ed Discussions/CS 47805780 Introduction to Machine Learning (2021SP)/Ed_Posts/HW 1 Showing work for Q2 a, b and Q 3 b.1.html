  Does showing a correct final diagram for Q2 a, b and Q 3 b.1 suffice or should we be showing work at each step (e.g. how each line segment is calculated, how each feature is selected, etc)?

  for Q2 a and Q3 b.1 yes, you only need a diagram.

 <paragraph>
  for Q2 b, don't forget to explain how the change in scaling can cause trouble.
