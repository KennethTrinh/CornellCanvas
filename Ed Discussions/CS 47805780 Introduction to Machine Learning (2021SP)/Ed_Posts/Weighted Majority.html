 If the weighted majority gets the prediction correct, do we still lower the weights of the minority or no? Do we only lower the weights if the majority gets it wrong?

  You always lower the weight on

   any
  </i>
  hypothesis that predicted wrong. Whether or not that hypothesis was in the majority or minority doesn't matter.
