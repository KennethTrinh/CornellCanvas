 I might be missing something, but I feel like I have seen conflicting information on using future data for prediction. I understand that we canNOT use future data for prediction in the creative part, because we have t-values. However, for the baseline dataset, can we use all the training data provided? For example, we have data for Belgium in October. Can we use those when we train our model, since they are future data compared to the September data in the testing set?

  Yes, as long as you don't explicitly use future data points to "look up" the correct answer in the t-values it is fine. For the baseline you can use the whole dataset to train your model.
