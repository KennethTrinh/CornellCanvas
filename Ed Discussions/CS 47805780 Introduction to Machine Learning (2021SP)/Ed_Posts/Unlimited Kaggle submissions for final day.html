  Would it be possible to have unlimited Kaggle submissions tomorrow? My group is struggling to get everything done, and having unlimited submissions on the final day would relieve a lot of stress rather than carefully &amp; stressfully choosing 10 submissions that may be a gamble whether it would work as expected.

  ^ Please. We're getting very good validation accuracy but terrible test accuracy. The only way to test our models is by submissions!

  We increased the number of submissions to 20 for the final day. See #1447.
