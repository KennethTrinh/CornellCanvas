 This is more of a question about the algorithm. Say we have three points and we go through them in the order A, B, C. We updated w after looking at B. Now, do we go on to check C and start from A again?

  I think #273 implies that after updating w with B, you start by checking A first and going down the line in order (don't check C first) but I could be wrong

   Right, I think because order matters it is important to start back with the first vector after any update.
