 Hello! In the online discussion, Professor Joachims said the answer for this question is 6, and I think we get it by multiplying the size of two feature sets. Maybe I'm missing something here, but wouldn't it be 12 since we can switch "yes" and "no" answers?

   Can you explain further why? What does it mean to switch yes/no answers?

    For example, in the example given above, we can write if taste good and smell fruity ==&gt; yes, otherwise no. That's a different function.
