 It says "provide an expression in terms of the sample error, and alpha, and epsilon". However, don't we need n also? And if we can use epsilon, do we really need alpha?
</p>
<p>
 I got totally confused.

  n is also allowed as part of your expression.  If have derived an expression for epsilon (in terms of alpha, etc.) it is acceptable to substitute epsilon into the confidence interval where applicable.
