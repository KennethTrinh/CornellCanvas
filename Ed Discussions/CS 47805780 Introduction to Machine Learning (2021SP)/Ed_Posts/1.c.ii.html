 Does the hyperplane we construct in part (ii) know the groups Q, L, and G, or is that still unknown for this part of the problem (i.e can we use the groups in our answer)?

  A good question! Consider this: imagine you're training a SVM on this dataset. Since we've promised that the dataset is separable, you know that it will end up with some separating hyperplane. We can reason about this hyperplane without actually knowing exactly what its values are.

  Can you make guarantees about what this hyperplane looks like on the groups Q, L, and G? If so, you can use them in your answer!
