  In project 0 there was a part where we weren't allowed to use for loops in our implementation. I just wanted to make sure - are we allowed to use for loops unless otherwise specified? Thank you!

  Yes, you may use for loops throughout project 1 (but there may be numpy functions that serve those purposes more succinctly).
