  For 3bi, I got an m that is much larger than the m I got for 3bii (I'm not trying to give away an answer but it would be equivalent to something of the scale of like 100 versus 1). I was wondering how this made sense. Is this because 3bi is taking into account the entire hypothesis space while 3bii is only examining one question, so 3bii would just naturally be smaller?
