  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  we graded the prereq assessment last night and I just released the scores on Gradescope. The main purpose of the prereq assessment is to give you a good idea of the math that is going to come up during the class, and how well prepared you are. I want to make sure that there are no surprises. Here is how I recommend you look at your score:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If there were a few questions here and there where your knowledge was a bit fuzzy, then welcome to the club. Math is easy to forget if you don't use it for a while. Please read up on it, but that seems manageable.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If there was a whole section where you had substantial holes in your prerequisite knowledge, it will be difficult to catch up. This is particularly true for the section on probability, since we will be using probability quite a bit in this class - after all, ML really is all about making predictions and managing uncertainty.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If you have fewer than 40 points, then you have substantial holes in more than one area. I do not think that you will be able to follow this class, and I will reach out to you via email. In some cases there are mitigating circumstances (e.g. only realized at 4:50pm that the exam was due at 5:00pm) and I will not force you to unenroll, but generally I think you are heading for a bad semester...
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  We will be posting the solution tomorrow. And you can submit regrade requests until the deadline stated in Gradescope.
 </paragraph>

  Cheers

  I was wondering where I could find the deadline for the regrade requests on Gradescope? Thank you.

  Gradescope has no feature that let's instructors simulate the student view. I was assuming that it must be showing it somewhere, and maybe a student could chime in here. In any case, I set it to Feb 25 2021 05:00 PM.

  No worries, I don't believe it is a feature students can view on gradescope, I've only seen it on cmsx, thank you!

  I'm having trouble accessing the solutions to the prereq exam on Canvas. I was wondering if anyone else was having a similar issue? The Cornell Box link redirects to an error page.

  With the hectic and uncertainty of enrollment / travel / quarantine, some students missed the prereq-assessment deadline, or ended up with little time to do the work. I don't this to be a bad start into the semester for anybody - even if it is only 1% of your final grade - especially since the prereqs are not really about what you are learning in this class anyway.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  So, when it comes to making the final grades, I will use the max(Percentage on Prereq, Percentage on Prelim 1) for this 1% of your final grade. This way, everybody has a chance to make up for a bad performance on the prereq assessment.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  But don't take a bad prereq score lightly - unless there were mitigating circumstances, it still means that you may not be sufficiently prepared for this class.

  Is there supposed to be more to the explanation of Probability 4 in the solutions? The last line says "P consider" and then nothing else.
