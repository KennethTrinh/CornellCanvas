  If I used Vocareum in a previous semester, do I need to pay for Vocareum again? There is a notification on top of the page each time I open Vocareum asking me to pay for it.

  If you paid for Vocareum for only that semester (3 months), you'll have to pay again for the next 3 months for this course.
