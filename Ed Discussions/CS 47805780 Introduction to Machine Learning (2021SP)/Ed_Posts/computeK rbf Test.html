  The default test for computeK is the following code:
 </paragraph>
 <pre>K=computeK("rbf",xTr,xTr,kpar=0.05)
</pre>
 <paragraph>
  In the description of the function, when ktype = rbf, it says to use the following formula:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  k(x,z)=exp(−gamma * ||x−z||^2)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Won't this result in exp(-gamma*(0)) = exp(0) = 1 in this scenario? Also doesn't this always return a single value and not an n x m matrix for all inputs?
  <break>
  </break>

  The kernel is intended to take in two vectors and return a single value.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  In our case, we're looking for a kernel matrix; when you plug in $X$ and $Z$ (matrices) instead of $x$ and $z$ (vectors), how does that affect the dimensions?
