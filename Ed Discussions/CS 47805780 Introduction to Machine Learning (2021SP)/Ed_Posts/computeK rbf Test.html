 The default test for computeK is the following code:
</p>
<pre>K=computeK("rbf",xTr,xTr,kpar=0.05)
</pre>
<p>
 In the description of the function, when ktype = rbf, it says to use the following formula:
</p>
<p>
 k(x,z)=exp(−gamma * ||x−z||^2)
</p>
<p>
 Won't this result in exp(-gamma*(0)) = exp(0) = 1 in this scenario? Also doesn't this always return a single value and not an n x m matrix for all inputs?
 <break>
 </break>
</p>

  The kernel is intended to take in two vectors and return a single value.
 </p>
 <p>
  In our case, we're looking for a kernel matrix; when you plug in $X$ and $Z$ (matrices) instead of $x$ and $z$ (vectors), how does that affect the dimensions?
