   Just tried watching it; this is not the discussion section from this semester, but seems to be from October? Is it possible to upload the  current version, as I do remember there were some mistakes on the worksheet discussed during the session.

    Check Canvas now, the correct discussion video from last week's section has been posted under tab "Discussion Section: Week 5 (Mar 15 - Mar 19)". Sorry for the delay, there was some canvas issue solved.
