 Hi, I'm failing the cross_validation on the correctness report. I've put what my picture looks like &amp; the ErrorMatrix below.
</p>
<p>
 I'm wondering if I'm finding 'bestC' and 'bestLmbda' incorrectly -- I've tried a 2d-argmin, but multiple test errors in the ErrorMatrix are usually ~ 0.
</p>
<p>
 What does 'Use the parameter search to find the optimal parameter' mean?
</p>
<p>
 Thanks!

  I am having the same issue. I currently also have similar error rates as you do. I am wondering if we need to get similar error rates as in the plot below.

   I also got similar error, and in my case, I found out that I was using exp(-g|x-z|), instead of the correct exp(-g|x-z|^2).

   Basically, we need to use l2distance squared. In fundamental sense, it shouldn't make any difference, but it seems the autograder thinks it's important... I wonder if you made the same mistake.
