 2a says "please draw the decision boundary for this neural network in the given coordinate system" but no coordinate system or latex template is given. What sort of graph should we create? Is there any chance a latex template could be provided?

  The given coordinate system is just referring to a 2d graph of x2 vs x1; i.e. you should draw a 2-d graph of x2 vs x1 and show where the boundary falls. I'm not sure about latex templates, but you should either be able to find examples of that online, or draw it by hand and include the image in your latex file.
