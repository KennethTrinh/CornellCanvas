  I'm not able to download preds as an actual CSV. Box forces me to download it as a PDF. Is this intended or am I missing something?

  I was able to download it as a .csv from the folder in overleaf (homework 2 -&gt; latex template)

  Yeah, sorry about that. Forgot about some of the Box permission issues -- you can't download it because we can't watermark it, which means you technically have the ability to re-upload it later on! While the staff isn't actually worried about preds.csv, it's kind of troublesome to mess with box. So for now, please download it from overleaf.
