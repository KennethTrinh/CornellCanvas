 For the final project, does our grade for the baseline solution just come from our ability to get over 70% accuracy on the public dataset on Kaggle or does it depend on our ability to get over 70% on the private dataset as well? Thank you!

  I think it's just the public dataset. "We will use the public accuracy for the 70% baseline and the 150k mean squared error creative solution, but for the extra credit you have to do well on the private accuracy. Hence getting into the top 10 in the public leader board does not guarantee the extra credit, which is again part of the realism of working in machine learning."
