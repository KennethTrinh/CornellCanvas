 I was wondering what the last day is to change grade  in this course and the last day for dropping without a withdrawal. The university registrar website seems to have multiple dates. Also, will dropping the course be an option for us after taking the prelim1?
</p>
<p>
 Thank you.

  According to the registrar (
  <a href="https://registrar.cornell.edu/calendar/2020-2021">
   https://registrar.cornell.edu/calendar/2020-2021
  </a>
  ) the last day to drop a class or change grading basis is April 5th. The 1st prelim is on 3/29-3/30 (Canvas), so you would have that option.
