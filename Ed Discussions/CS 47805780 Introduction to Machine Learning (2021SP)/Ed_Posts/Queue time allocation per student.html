 I have been waiting for an hour but the TA is still on the second person in the queue.
</p>
<p>
 Could it be possible to limit the time spent on each student so that other people could get help too?  I literally signed up 27 minutes before the OH starts but still have 12 people ahead of me.

  Hi, I'm trying my best to get through people as quickly as possible! I'm sorry if there are a lot of people and I can't get through everyone! Also if you are in queue feel free to come to the zoom meeting to I can put you in a breakout room and call you when it's your turn. Thanks!

   There's an informal time limit but some TAs have been enforcing it more stringently than others; we can try to bring it up again at the next meeting, it's definitely abnormal to be spending 30+ minutes on one student. Thank you for expressing your concerns; also just a reminder that there's also a Qualtrics form listed in the syllabus in case you have any concerns about specific TAs in the future.

    Thanks! Definitely bring this up at the next meeting. I've had the same experience as the person who asked the question and every person I've met in the class has had the same experience across multiple different TAs. It's been difficult to get help in this class at OH.
