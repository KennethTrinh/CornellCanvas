 Hello,
</p>
<p>
 I am having trouble dealing with the DCP error in dualqp. What operations on the variable vector alpha trigger this error and which ones do not? I have tried to express the double summation in the objective of the dual SVM formula in multiple ways, but each time I get the DCP error, even after following the advice in #610 and #572 and using quad_form.

  I spent a lot of time looking at
  <a href="https://www.cvxpy.org/tutorial/functions/index.html">
   the operators section
  </a>
  to understand how it was using operators like @, *, etc, and when it was appropriate to use each case. That, and writing out explicitly what I expected quad_form to calculate helped me figure it out.
