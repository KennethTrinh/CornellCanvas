 How do we know that the depth of the tree is equal to the algorithm's # of mistakes?
</p>
<p>
 In lecture, it was mentioned that it was because the algorithm always chooses the correct label to be the label that the algorithm did not predict, but I don't understand how this makes the depth of the tree equal to the algorithm's # of mistakes, because, even if the algorithm didn't make a mistake, wouldn't the next depth of the tree still be created?
</p>
<p>
 Or, is it that, if the algorithm didn't make a mistake then the tree would just stop at that node and wouldn't create another level? However, I don't understand why this would be the case.

  This is just helping visualize that binary search; when the algorithm makes a mistake you take the child node that would have avoided the mistake, and when you eventually land on a leaf you know that has to have perfect accuracy because of how you got there (e.g. if you end up at 3, 2 was too low and 4 was too high, so 3 has to work).
