 Hi, I was working on the creative portion of the assignment in a separate notebook since that is how it was organized on Kaggle, but when I try to combine my two notebooks into one for the Canvas submission, I am unable to import the creative csv files into the basic notebook because it says the data is already in the competition (it doesn't work when I try to read it into my code however). How can I fix this?
