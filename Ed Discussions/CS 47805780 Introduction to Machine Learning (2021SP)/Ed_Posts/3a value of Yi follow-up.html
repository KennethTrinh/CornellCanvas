 For homework 3a what do we put in the yi column? The actual misclassified value for yi prior to updating or the value yi would take on after the updation step?
</p>
<p>
 I would assume we would put the
 <b>
  misclassified
 </b>
 value of yi for xi prior to the update to w that takes place at the step.
</p>
<p>
 For ex, if our w was initialized to (0,0) which assigned a the first hypothetical Xi, yi pair in a hypothetical ordered set S, ((0,-1,), +1) with a value of -1, we would write:
</p>
<p>
 (0,-1)  |   (0,-1)  |  -1
</p>
<p>
 Is this the correct understanding of the problem? Or would we write +1 for yi, since that would be the yi after w was updated during that step?
</p>

  For 3(a), the yi column should be filled in with the true value of the point that was misclassified, so in the example you gave above it should be (0, -1) | (0, -1) | +1

   Well I already turned in my assignment and assumed the incorrect way. I actually inputed the before/ after yi values for every updation to be safe but did not include the correct classification value.
  </p>
  <p>
   I really don't feel like the instructions were clear, and it seems more logical to put the misclassified y_i since the correct one is directly given in the problem statement. Is there any chance both will be accepted?

    The graders are aware of the situation, and should have been correspondingly lenient.
