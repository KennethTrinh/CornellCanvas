  I am trying to implement
  <code>
   primalSVM
  </code>
  and understand how to translate the primal optimization problem into matrix multiplication but have been stuck for a while now on how to correctly write that out using NumPy and cvxpy. Any help would be appreciated.

  Finally figured it out. Not using cvxpy functions such as
  <code>
   multiply
  </code>
  was where I was stuck.
