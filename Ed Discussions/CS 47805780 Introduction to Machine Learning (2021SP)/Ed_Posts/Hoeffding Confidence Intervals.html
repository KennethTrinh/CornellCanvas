  In the formula for determining the bounds of a Hoeffing Confidence Interval, what is delta? I noticed that in the lecture video, we used delta = 0.025 for a 95% confidence interval, whereas in the discussion video we used delta = 0.05 for a 95% confidence interval.

  Hmm generally, you will use the delta as prescribed by your statistical test. If you're doing just a regular p confidence interval, one tail, then it is generally 0.05; howeve, for McNemars test it's two tailed-- thus we allow for 0.025 on either side.
