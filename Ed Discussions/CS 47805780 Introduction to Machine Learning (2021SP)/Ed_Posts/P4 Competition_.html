 I'm having trouble getting my competition score below 2000. I have tried implementing a grid search over the epochs (1000-3000) and number of neurons (50-300) for the second layer, and I can't really seem to do well. When I change the type of gradient search, sometimes I get scores as high as 80,000 to 90,000. Are there any tips for how to do better? I tried only using 2 layers, and that seemed to improve it slightly, but changing the learning rates (in either direction) seem to hurt the performance.

  Did you preprocess your training data?
