 Is it generally true that the parameter given by MAP is smaller than the parameter given by MLE, or is this something that is determined case-by-case?

  I don't think there is any reason why that would be the case. This largely depends on the prior chosen. For some priors (flat priors, for instance) the two are even guaranteed to coincide.
