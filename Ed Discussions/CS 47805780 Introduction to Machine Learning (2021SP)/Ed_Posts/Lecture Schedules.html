  Is there a recommended weekly schedule of when we should be watching the lectures and completing work?

  The asynchronous format allows lots of flexibility in when you complete lectures and work. I'd suggest starting early on both projects and homework to take full advantage of office hours (which are sometimes cramped around deadlines). Additionally, make sure to watch the lectures thoroughly before discussion section to get the most value out of the problems. Otherwise, when you complete the lectures and work is up to you.

  Lecture videos typically come out on Fridays, so I recommend scheduling some time for yourselves to watch them on Monday and Tuesday, since the quiz is due typically Wednesdays at 10:00am. This way everybody has watched the lectures before they head into their discussion section.

  Can we get approximate time of when the projects would be, so we can plan ahead? It seems a little bit unexpected to see what would come out.
