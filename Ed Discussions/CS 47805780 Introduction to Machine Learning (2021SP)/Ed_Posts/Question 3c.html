  Think about how a perceptron updates. On an update step, the weight vector $\vec{w}$ is being updated because it classified some point $x_i$ incorrectly. The weight vector is updated in this way: $\vec{w}_t = \vec{w}_{t-1}+\vec{x_i}\cdot y_i$. So, if you want $\vec{w}$ to change only a little, such that it classifies every point up until $x_i$ correctly while repeatedly classifying $x_i$ incorrectly, how can you configure the dataset to make this happen?
