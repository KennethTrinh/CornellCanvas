  Is there somewhere I can find the derivation for the constraint that the sum of (y_i*alpha_i) has to equal 0? I understand that this comes from accounting for nonhomogeneous linear classifiers, but I'm not sure how exactly we got this constraint.

  I don't think there's a derivation on the slides; I think a good way to think about it though is that alpha_i corresponds to an influence, or "force" as it's described later of point x_i on the decision boundary; basically what this is encoding is that the positive and negative points have the same total amount of influence on the decision boundary.

  Take a look at section 12.3 of
  <link href="https://mml-book.github.io/book/mml-book.pdf"/>
  https://mml-book.github.io/book/mml-book.pdf. It goes through the derivation of the dual for the non-homogeneous case.
