 Greeting Everyone :)
</p>
<p>
 Throughout the course, thus far, you all have been giving invaluable feedback about the quality of our office hours as well as how we could do better with distributing them. To improve our course, we're trying two things:
</p>
<p>
 1. We're actively making an effort to hold more office hours on "crunch" days before assignments; hopefully, these can match the need for help days before things are due.
</p>
<p>
 2. A new system for office hours using a website built by Cornell DTI:
 <a href="https://queueme.in/course/cs4780-sp-21">
  Queue-Me-In
 </a>
 . This is a system that allows you to join an office hour's queue with tags about questions you're having.
</p>
<p>
 For what to do, please click the link above and join this course as a student. Our TAs are currently putting in their office hours and the calendar on the left side of the queue interface will begin to populate with them. Zoom links are also able to be accessed by clicking on a TA's office hours on the queue calendar.
</p>
<p>
 For any questions about any of the above, let this post serve as a mega thread for solving them; the technology is relatively new to us as well but we will do our best to make this a great experience!
</p>
<p>
 Best,
</p>
