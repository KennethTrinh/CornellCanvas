  Besides the first reading and prereq assessment, is there anything else we should be doing this week?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Also, are readings usually intended to be done before or after lecture?

  Right now, that's all you need to do. Lectures come out on Fridays, so tomorrow there will be more to do.

  I think it's up to you to decide about the readings. I personally would read them after watching the lectures.

  Agreed. I suggest going through the material in the order in which I have arranged it in the module. Videos -&gt; Reading -&gt; Quiz.
