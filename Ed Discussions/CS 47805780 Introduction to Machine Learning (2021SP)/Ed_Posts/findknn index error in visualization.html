 I'm getting this index error and I'm not quite sure what the problem is since it's breaking in a function that was part of the starter code.. how should I approach this issue?

  Check that you're rerunning the entire notebook in case any important variables aren't being used. You'll notice that "visualize knn images" takes in your findknn function. Is your function correctly indexing any matrices it uses?
