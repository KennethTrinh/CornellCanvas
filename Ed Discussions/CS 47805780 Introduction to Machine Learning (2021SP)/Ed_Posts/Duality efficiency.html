 I think this was skimmed over in lectures but how is duality more efficient than the primal representation for large dimensions of x?

  With the dual representation you only need to calculate dot products of the xs, so if you can do that efficiently, it runs faster than the primal.

   Let me add that next week we will see Kernels, which give us a way to compute dot-products efficiently even if we have exponentially (or infinitely) many features. This is where the dual representation shines...
