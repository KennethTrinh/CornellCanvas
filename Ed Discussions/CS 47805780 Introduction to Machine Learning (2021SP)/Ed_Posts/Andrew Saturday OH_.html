  Hi all,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Just for this week, I will not be holding my regular Saturday office hours due to the break.  I'm hoping to add some extra hours next week closer to the prelim, but haven't pinned down a time yet and will keep you all posted (also need to move my OH next Thursday since they would be immediately after the prelim).
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I hope you all have a wonderful and rejuvenating few days off!
