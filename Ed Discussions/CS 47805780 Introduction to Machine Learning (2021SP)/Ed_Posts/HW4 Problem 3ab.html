<p>
 For problem 3a, are we assuming there is no bias?
</p>
<p>
 For problem 3b, what is s1, s2 referring to? And also I'm a little confused as to what the layer parameters are doing. For Conv2, does this mean it starts with a filter size of 15x15, the last layer had an output volume of 1 (because there was 1 channel) meaning the input layer was 1, and then the output volume for this is going to be 1?
</p>

  For 3a, both bias and no bias are valid. s1 and s2 are unknowns that you're trying to fill in, i.e. shape of the output of the second convolution layer and the size of the output of the flatten layer, respectively. The input to conv2 is 1 382x382 matreix (as opposed to 3) and the filter size is 15x15.

   thanks! and in the first column (layer parameters), the - means that we don't have to fill anything in right? because there are no layers for those?

    Right, there's no need to fill in the first column, all the parameters are already given.
