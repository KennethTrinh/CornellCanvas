  Do we need to show work for 3cii? If so what sort of work should we show? Seems like any attempt to show work would get really out of hand in terms of how much it would require you to writeâ€”the only reasonable idea I had was to provide the NumPy code I used to calculate the answer. I lost point on the last HW for not showing work on a similar question without it being expressly asked for, so just wanted to make sure.

  Also I've seen some other threads mentioning something about "flipping the filter." What does this mean and do we need to do it? If so how?
