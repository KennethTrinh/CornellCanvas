  For 2(b) it says "for both networks" after sample points x1 and x2 - do you mean for both points?

   It means both networks, referring to the min and max "networks"

    Ahh, nice save! But it is in fact a typo... :') Last year, we asked for two separate min/max networks. We want you to have 2 evaluations, of points (3,4) and (5,-2), on the one network.
