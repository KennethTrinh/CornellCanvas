  I think a lot of people are struggling with the current project and having to meet the deadline tomorrow while also wanting to be prepared for the prelim. It is very overwhelming! The office hours are crazy full too, with no help in sight.

 <paragraph>
  Is it at all possible to extend the deadline for project 3 to take the pressure off of this and allow us to focus on preparing for the prelim?

  We could try and see what Professor Joachims thinks, but I expect he'll point to the 7 free project late days policy.

  With all due respect, I believe the engagement on this post shows there is interest in this, and I hope this follow-up does not come across poorly.

  It seems unfair to use slip days on an issue that is more related to course planning than student ability. This is a significantly more difficult project than the ones past; personally most of my time has been spent learning to use the solver itself. There is such significant demand for help with this project that many are unable to even be seen during office hours (I have tried to go to two so far).

  Additionally, with the review session tomorrow I am sure

  It just seems like this week was optimized a bit poorly, and some slack for the students would be appreciated.

  Agreed, office hours have been crazy busy and it's really difficult to get any help. Would be awesome if the deadline was pushed back by a week so we can focus on studying for the prelim.

  I hear you! Quite frankly, I feel pretty stretched thin these days as well. And we should all be mindful that the TA's have a lot going on as well right now.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  So, let's just do it. We extend the deadline for P3 by a week to next Friday (Apr 2) at 5pm. It will not cost you late days, but it is also the very final time to submit.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  So, with only half the lectures this week and the extension on P3, this hopefully clears up some time for prelim prep.

  I totally understand, I'm sure it's very difficult for the TAs with the number of people in the office hours. Thank you so much for the extension!
