 I have a quick question about part of the proof from the 'Perceptron's Convergence and Analysis' part of lecture. When proving the upper bound for the function (Step 3), a proof by contradiction is given. I would like to know if there is any particular reason for choosing an indirect proof? I like to avoid indirect proofs when there are direct proofs which are just as simple (I'm not a constructivist but still...), and I think you could also prove that step directly (maybe even importing a few theorems from analysis if you want to be pedantic).
</p>
<p>
 I would like to know if that's true or if I am maybe missing the point of the proof? Sorry if that's a silly question and thank you!
</p>

   Difficult question to answer because sometimes that just how things are, the method Thorsten chose to prove convergence was just one way to do it, and likely out there exist alternate methods which might prove it directly.

   I wouldn't sly from contradiction proofs you know, which direct proofs and induction it's one of your tools to show things-- not any less valid than a direct proof.

    Hmm, interesting question. I don't actually know of a constructive proof. If somebody finds a different proof, I'd be curious to see it.

     I initially thought I had something... but it turns out it uses theorems which are themselves nonconstructive. I tried doing some quick research but I did not find any constructive counterparts.
    </p>

     This made me think about constructive mathematics in an applied sense: is there any value in using intuitionistic logic over standard FOL within the context of machine learning?
