 In the first slide above, when we are computing the gradient of the outcome of the neural network with respect to (wrt) the weights going from layer {d-1} to layer d, the second term in the chain rule computes the gradient of the intermediate function s
 <b>

   wrt the weights.
  </i>
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 HOWEVER, in the second slide above, when we are computing the gradient of the outcome of the neural network wrt the weights going from layer {d-2} to layer {d-1}, the second term in the chain rule computes the gradient of the intermediate function s
 <b>
  <i>
   wrt the values of the nodes in layer {d-1}
  </i>
 </b>
 .
</p>
<p>
 <underline>
  my question is
 </underline>
 : when we're doing the chain rule, how do we know when we are supposed to compute the gradient of the intermediate function s
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  <i>
   wrt the vector w
  </i>
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 vs.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  <i>
   wrt the vector v
  </i>
 </b>
 ?

  We do both in an alternating pattern; basically, whatever is most recent in the NN.

   What do you mean by "most recent" ?
  </p>
  <p>
   Also, are there no weights going from layer {d-1} to layer d (i.e. the output layer) in this case? If yes, why is that the case here?

    By most recent I just mean whatever we last did in running the backpropagation algorithm. There are weights going from d-1 to d, since it is a linear layer.
