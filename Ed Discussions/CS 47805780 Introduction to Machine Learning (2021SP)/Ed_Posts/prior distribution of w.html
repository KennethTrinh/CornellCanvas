 How does this prior distribution on the weight vector ensure that the weight vector will stay short in length? From what I understand, we are modeling the weight vector as normally distributed, but are we saying that the weight vector itself is a RV? If we were to draw this normal distribution, I understand the y-axis would represent the probabilities, but would the x-axis represent the weight vector itself? So would the x-axis be incremented by vector values? I'm a bit confused on how exactly the prior distribution represents the fact that we want the weight vector to stay short in length.

  The way I like to think about this is that given no knowledge at all about the data we would think of w as some random vector close to zero. Each data point gives us a little more information about the size and direction of w. Since ws far from 0 are extremely unlikely given our initial assumption about w, it won't be made large unless the data REALLY wants us to.

  If you were to draw the probability as a function of w there would be a single f axis and an "x-axis" for each entry in w, and it would look like a multi-dimensional generalization of a bell curve (which is difficult to picture for w of length more than 2).
