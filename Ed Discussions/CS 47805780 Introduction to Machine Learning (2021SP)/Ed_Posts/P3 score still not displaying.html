 I'm having the same issue as #473. Interestingly, when I click submit, my score is 100/100 for a while and it says "Your grade might change as the grading job for your last submission is not yet complete", but it always reverts back to 0/100. I'm also having the same issue as #560, if that's related.
</p>

 I tried commenting out everything that wasn't in the &lt;Graded&gt; sections, but that unfortunately didn't work.

  We made some changes to our autograder scripts. Could you try to resubmit?
