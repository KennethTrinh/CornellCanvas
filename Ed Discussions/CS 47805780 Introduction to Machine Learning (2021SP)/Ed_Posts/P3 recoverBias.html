 When we create the recoverBias function, should we use a loop that evaluates each alpha individually to see if it is between 0 and C and inside the loop calculate the bias? Or is there another way to think about this?

  Can you think of something we may be trying to minimize in this recover bias?

   I am trying to minimize the value of C-2alphai by indexing different entries of alpha, but it seems I could not use a variable as the index of an array. Is this the right way of thinking or is there another way to do this?

     Yes I used numpy functions argmin and absolute to calculate the index of alpha with minimun absolute value for C-2alphai.
