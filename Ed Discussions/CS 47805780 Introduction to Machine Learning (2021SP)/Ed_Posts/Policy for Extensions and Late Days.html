  According to the intro slides, "everybody has 7 “free” late days for assignments. They mitigate any delays that are outside your control (e.g. sickness, network outage, weather, broken computer, sick TAs, tardy group mates). Use them wisely. Lowest assignment grade will be replaced by second-lowest assignment grade."

  You get 7 free late days for projects too (separately from HWs, as far as I understand). Lowest grade for projects is also replaced by 2nd lowest.

  Does the "1 percentage point reduction of the cumulated final homework grade" only apply if you've used up all your free late days? Or does it apply even if you have used a free late day?

  Also do we need to notify anyone if we are using a free late day assuming we have them left over?

  The 1% off should refer to once all the free days are used up (i.e. 5%/day/assignment). You don't need to notify anyone when you're using a free late day.
