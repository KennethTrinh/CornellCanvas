 For Question 3C,  to quantify the probability that one random monkey gets lucky, I adapted the following equation (and showed the steps). However I end up with an upper bound for the probability, not a lower bound, like "probability of one random monkey getting all 20 years correct is &lt;= X". Is that okay? If not how can I do a lower bound?

  Getting an upper bound is fine. How can you use the bound you found to address Tianyu's argument?
