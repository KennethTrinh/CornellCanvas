  When graphing points on a graph, would you classify a test point based on boundaries or based on the majority. Say 5 nearest neighbors, 3 blue and 2 red. If a test point is in the red boundary would it be blue (majority) or red(boundary)?

  What exactly do you mean by red (boundary)?  In general, the classification of a test point is always going to be based on the majority of its neighbors, and the boundaries are drawn to show the cutoff lines for which on one side there would be a majority one label, and on the other a different label (boundaries are based on the majority as well).  As such, the boundary should always agree with the majority of nearest neighbors in classifying test points.
