 Hello, in question B the bullet point examples seem to imply that
</p>
<p>
 P(xi=z | y = -1) + P(xi=z | y= +1) = 1
</p>
<p>
 This seems really weird, but it's consistent for all of the bullet points. If this was true, it would mean that P(xi = z) = 1 and that seems like that would mean that xi is a useless variable because it's always z.
</p>

  You're missing the multiplication by $P(Y=-1)$ and $P(Y=1)$:
 </p>
 <p>
  $$P(X_{i} = z) = P(X_{i} = z | Y = -1)P(Y = -1) + P(X_{i} = z | Y = 1)P(Y = 1)$$
 </p>
 <p>
  So $P(X_{i} = 0) = 0.4 \times 0.3 + 0.6 \times 0.7 = 0.54$
 </p>

   As an add-on, make sure that you are differentiating between conditional probability and regular probabilities. As Scott has written, determining $$P(X_{i}=z)$$ require you to use the law of total probability
