 We are given f(x,paramater) as a distribution of picking xi from the population, does this f() correspond to p(y|x,w)? So is it saying that this f() is essentially replacing the sigmoid function in MLE computation?
</p>
<p>
 Also, I'm still confused as to what exp(w dot x) means in the function. Is this some computation that we must make or does it carry more of an intuitive sense?

  Here,
  <i>
   f
  </i>
  is the probability distribution function for an
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution">
   exponential distribution.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  The conditional distribution for the observed
  <i>
   n
  </i>
  draws is given by
 </p>
 <math>
  f\left(x_1,x_2,...,x_n\ |\ \lambda\right)
 </math>
 <p>
  If the distribution is assumed to be
  <i>
   iid
  </i>
  , the likelihood would be
 </p>
 <math>
  f\left(x_1,x_2,...,x_n\ |\ \lambda\right)=\Pi_{i=1}^nf\left(x_i\ |\ \lambda\right)
 </math>
 <p>
  And the given probability distribution function can be substituted and manipulated to give the maximum likelihood estimate, similar to the problem on page 12.
 </p>

   so just to clarify, how is sigmoid function applied to the distribution of f in this case? or there's no need to apply sigm because the likelihood function is alrady provided?

  f is a probability mass function, i.e. given lambda and x, what is the probability that the random variable X comes out to x. The exp(-lambda dot x) term is such that, as x increases the probability of that x being chosen gets exponentially smaller, and the lambda controls how quickly it decays. Since the fs are already probabilities, a sigmoid would not be beneficial.
