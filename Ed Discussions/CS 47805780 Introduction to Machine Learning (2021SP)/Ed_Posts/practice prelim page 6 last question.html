  We are given f(x,paramater) as a distribution of picking xi from the population, does this f() correspond to p(y|x,w)? So is it saying that this f() is essentially replacing the sigmoid function in MLE computation?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Also, I'm still confused as to what exp(w dot x) means in the function. Is this some computation that we must make or does it carry more of an intuitive sense?

  Here,
  <italic>
   f
  </italic>
  is the probability distribution function for an

  exponential distribution.

  The conditional distribution for the observed

   n

  draws is given by
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  f\left(x_1,x_2,...,x_n\ |\ \lambda\right)
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  If the distribution is assumed to be
  <italic>
   iid

  , the likelihood would be
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  f\left(x_1,x_2,...,x_n\ |\ \lambda\right)=\Pi_{i=1}^nf\left(x_i\ |\ \lambda\right)
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  And the given probability distribution function can be substituted and manipulated to give the maximum likelihood estimate, similar to the problem on page 12.

  so just to clarify, how is sigmoid function applied to the distribution of f in this case? or there's no need to apply sigm because the likelihood function is alrady provided?

  f is a probability mass function, i.e. given lambda and x, what is the probability that the random variable X comes out to x. The exp(-lambda dot x) term is such that, as x increases the probability of that x being chosen gets exponentially smaller, and the lambda controls how quickly it decays. Since the fs are already probabilities, a sigmoid would not be beneficial.
