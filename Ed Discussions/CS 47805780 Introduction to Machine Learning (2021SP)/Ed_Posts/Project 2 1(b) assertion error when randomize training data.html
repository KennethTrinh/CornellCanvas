  The problem statement for 1(b) says "Make sure you randomize the order of the training data on each iteration." But when I do that after each iteration, it gives me an assertion error when I run the Perceptron test. When I get rid of the randomization during each iteration. I get a nice plot and no error every time. Am I doing something wrong? Why should we randomnize the training set after each iteration

  In practice, it would converge faster with a randomized training set after each iteration.
