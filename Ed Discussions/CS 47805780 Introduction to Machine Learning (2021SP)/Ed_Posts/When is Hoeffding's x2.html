  In the "finding a predictive county" problem in discussion, Professor Joachims uses this version of Hoeffding's, which does not have a 2 in front of the RHS:

  However, the solution to the Tianyu Silverman problem in HW5 has a 2 in front of the Hoeffding's RHS:

  These seem like the exact same premise just with different numbers. Why is there a 2 in front of the hoeffding's for the Tianyu problem but not the discussion problem? I asked a TA and they weren't too sure either. I thought it could have been because of the absolute value sign in the second probability, which makes it consider "both tails", but why would the second problem need to consider both tails if the first one didn't?

  You are right that the 2 has to do with the absolute value and being "both tails". Honestly, I don't get why the homework solution considers two tails when we are specifically considering the probability of the hedge fund having 0 sample error rate and 0.5 prediction error rate.
