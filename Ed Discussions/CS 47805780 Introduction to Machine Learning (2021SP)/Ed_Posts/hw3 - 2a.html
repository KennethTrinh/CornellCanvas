  I've plotted the points in the feature space using xi from 0,1..5 getting (0,0),(1,1/4)..(5,25/4) and I don't see how this feature space is linearly separable. This feature space would require a polynomial line again to separate xi at 2,3,4 from the rest of the pts.

  Also are we supposed to consider negative integers as within the domain as well, or start at zero?

  I think it should be linearly separable because like y = 1/4x^2 is an upward parabola and you can connect any two points and that will basically section off the parabola?

  On a separate note, if the decision boundary crosses a point labeled +1, will it be classified as positive, negative, or neither?

  Try plotting the feature space points, a linear separator does exist for 2&lt;=x&lt;=4. I was able to identify it visually.
