  Similar to #578, I am also failing the crossvalidation test in the autograder, but all tests before that passed.

  I am wondering if we could rely on that report and call it safe for the functions before, and try to find problems in the current function. I am also wondering in the general sense what could possibly be wrong in this function. My error matrix plot does show higher error rates than the example given. Could that also indicate a problem?

  Solved: I found the largest alpha instead of the one furthest from 0 and C in retrieveBias. The error was not caught by the test cases earlier.
