  I submitted a regrade request almost immediately after the grades got released and it's still unanswered. In case they get back to me after the deadline and I want to re-submit the request on the same question, will I be able to do so?

  We are working to give responses to all of the requests, and they should all be in very soon.  I'm not sure if Gradescope will let you resubmit a request after the deadline, but hopefully it doesn't come to that -- otherwise feel free to make a private post here explaining your situation and someone will definitely take a look.
