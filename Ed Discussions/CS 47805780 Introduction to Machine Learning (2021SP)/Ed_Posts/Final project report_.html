  I'm a little unclear as to what the difference between the .ipynb upload and pdf upload for the final project are.  Should we just save our .ipynb as a pdf too? Or do we have to write up some kind of formal report?

  Yes, you save your notebook as a pdf and submit that along with the notebook itself.
