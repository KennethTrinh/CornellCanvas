 Hello, I couldn't find a course calendar and was wondering if we had one, or if not how many / how frequent assignments and problem sets will be, as I didn't see anything that specified this information either. Should we expect 1 assignment and 1 problem set weekly? Thanks!

  Hi! According to the lecture slides from the Kick-off session (see under modules in canvas), there are at most 5 homeworks and 5 projects. Each is due a week later. Take the total number of weeks in a semester (~14 weeks) and divide by 5 taking into account 1 week per assignment to submit, so approximately every 2 weeks there is homework and a project.

   If all goes according to plan, we will be on a two week-cycle with homeworks and projects. That means HW2 will come out next Tuesday, and P2 will come out next Friday. And this then repeats every two weeks for the total of 5 homeworks and 5 projects.
