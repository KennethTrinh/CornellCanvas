 I'm failing just one test from
 <code>
  naivebayesPXY_mle
 </code>
 and
 <code>
  naivebayesPXY_smoothing
 </code>
 , and am otherwise getting some points for them. Is there any way to get more info about my submission/the test cases? Should I be looking for edge cases to pass these tests, or is it likely my code is completely wrong but just coincidentally passing the rest of the tests?

     I've run into the same issue, not sure what I'm doing wrong. Did you end up figuring it out?

  I don't know if anyone else did this, but my mistakes were confusing the multivariate and multinomial bayes estimates and using exact values for some parameters.

   Make sure you flatten the array before returning.

    It's likely there's a bug in your submission. I saw something like this in OH, where the student was missing a couple of terms in the bayes rule expression, so maybe check if that's your problem. For further help we would need more detailed information about your submission.
