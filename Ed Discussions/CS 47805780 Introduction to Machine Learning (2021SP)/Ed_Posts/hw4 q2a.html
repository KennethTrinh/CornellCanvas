 What are the formula for the dotted lines?  How do you calculate the equation for the dotted lines? What is the label of each section? The solution did not include these. I asked in multiple office hours but was not able to get an answer. Thanks!

  The dotted lines correspond to the decision boundaries of $z_1$ and $z_2$. That is, "the decision boundary for the $z_1$ ReLU unit is given by the equation $\frac{1}{2}x_1 - x_2 = 0$, while the decision boundary for the $z_2$ ReLU unit is given by the equation $x_2 - 4x_1 = 0$". You can rearrange this into slope intercept form to see which dotted line corresponds with which.

  To figure out which sections correspond with which labels, try plotting in values into the above equations. For instance, try $\begin{bmatrix} x_1\\ x_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1\\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$. You will see that plugging these values into the expressions above ($\frac{1}{2}x_1 - x_2 = \frac{1}{2} - 1 &lt; 0$ &amp; $x_2 - 4x_1 = 1- 4 &lt; 0$.
