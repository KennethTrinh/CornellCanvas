 In #1397, it says we must hit 150k MSE to get full credit for creative. If we do not hit it, will partial credit be given, or is it all-or-nothing?

  No worries. For both the creative and the basic solution even a project that does not reach the threshold can get a very good grade. It not only matters how close you are to the threshold, it is even more important whether you designed your learning problem well and whether all your design choices is well justified and well explained. So, missing the threshold is certainly not an all or nothing.
