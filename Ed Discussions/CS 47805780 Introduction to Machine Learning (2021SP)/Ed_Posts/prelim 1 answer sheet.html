 Is the answer sheet, which is what needs to be printed out for the prelim, available before the start of prelim? I don't think I'll be able to print it out if we only have access to it during the exam.

  They will be available beforehand: "The answer sheet needs to be printed before the exam, and we will post a link to the PDF of the answer sheet well before the exam."
