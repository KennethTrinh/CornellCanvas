  What is a passing grade for the prereq exam? Can I assume 75?

  There isn't a hard threshold. 75 is a good ballpark/target. One important note: we also want to see decent scores across all 3 sections; it would be a good idea to aim for 70% across each section as well.

  We'll be looking at all the exams after grading this week; Thorsten will get back to those who may need additional preparation/background (esp. mathematic) to take this course. If you do poorly on the exam, you may have a hard time later in the semester, but note that most people have one or two weaker areas! It's perfectly normal to find sections of the exam challenging.

  tl;dr It's unlikely you'll be forced to drop the course. If you get contacted after the exam, it's recommended you take our advice seriously!
