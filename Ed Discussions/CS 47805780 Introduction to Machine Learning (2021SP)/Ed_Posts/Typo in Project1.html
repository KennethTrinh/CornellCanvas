 In (b), the description says that $n$ is the number of test vectors, whereas the code says xTe is a mxd matrix, i.e. it should have $m$ vectors. I believe the notation in this class is that the number of test cases is denoted by $n$, so the code specification is wrong, isn't it? There is the same typo in (d).

  Yes it seems that there are some discrepancies between the description and the code specification. For the purposes of your solution, treat the code specification as correct. Your returned I and D should be k x m where m is the number of test vectors.
