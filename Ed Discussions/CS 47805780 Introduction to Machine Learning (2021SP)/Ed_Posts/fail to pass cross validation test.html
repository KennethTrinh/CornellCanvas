  I passed the tests except for the cross validation one. I got a similar pic in Cross validation but it seems the error rate is bit high. The Error Matrix is
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  [[0.5  0.5  0.5  0.43 0.37] [0.5  0.5  0.28 0.12 0.06] [0.5  0.49 0.11 0.03 0.  ] [0.5  0.38 0.02 0.   0.  ] [0.5  0.11 0.   0.   0.  ] [0.47 0.02 0.   0.   0.  ] [0.44 0.02 0.   0.   0.  ]]

  What is the possible reason?

  Could you make a private post and share your code?

  I had the same looking output, check for 2 things:
  <break>
  </break>
  1. Make sure you're passing correct args like xValid and yValid.
  <break>
  </break>
  2. Check your recoverbias function, it may not be the alpha closest to C/2. There's np.absolute() if you need it.

  Thank you soooooo much! I was confused for a long long time, and didn't figure out! Finally, I found that I used the abs() instead of np.absolute(), even though I still don't know the difference (np.absolute() and abs()) now.

  You're welcome! They used to be different on earlier versions. Should be the same now on the latest versions but I once had to learn a painful debugging lesson about their differences so I stick to np.func if a similar func exists for both inbuilt-python and numpy.
