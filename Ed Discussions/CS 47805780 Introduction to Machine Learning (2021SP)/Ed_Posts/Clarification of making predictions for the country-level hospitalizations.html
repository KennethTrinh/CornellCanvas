 Hi, I am a little bit confused about the "country-level" prediction, does it mean that we should build a model for each country? For example, if there are 4 countries, then we should apply 2 algorithms to each country's data, and have 8 models total, 2 for each country?
</p>
<p>
 It may be a silly question, thanks!

  You should be only building 2 models, one for each algorithm you use.
