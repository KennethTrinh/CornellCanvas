  I know we should use the bound on m for realizable learning settings, but I'm a little confused on the best way to compute the |H| here.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  We have d binary features, and we're looking at the class of OR-functions.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  So, if we have d=1 feature, then |H| would be zero ? because there is no possible OR function?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If we d=2 features, then |H| would be one, because we only have (x1 or x2) ?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If we have d=3 features, then |H| would be 4, because we have: (x1 or x2), (x2 or x3), (x1 or x3), (x1 or x2 or x3) ?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I don't really see a pattern here though, and don't know what would be the best way to generalize this.

  You're on the right track, although d means the number of boolean variables, not the length of the OR expression.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  It's any OR expression of any length, so:
 </paragraph>
 <list style="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    1 variable: x1 would be an option, or x2, or xd -- as well as their negations, like ~x1, ~x2, ~xd. These are all OR functions.
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    2 variables: x1 or x2, ~x1 or x3, x2 or xd, all count. You can use at most 2 variables.
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    3 variables: x1 or x3 or x4, etc.
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    ...
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    d variables: x1 or x2 or x3 or ... or xd. But don't forget that all the variables could be negated too.
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
 </list>

  Would be |H| = 3^d - 1 then since for each variable we have the option of not including it, including it with no negation, or including it with negation. We then subtract 1 since we cannot exclude all variables?

  This is beyond late, sorry. But yes; and actually, the exclusion of all variables is allowed as an expression (although if you write down your assumptions you can typically get full credit)
