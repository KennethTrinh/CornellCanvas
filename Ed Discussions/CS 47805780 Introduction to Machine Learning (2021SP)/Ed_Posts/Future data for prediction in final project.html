  Can we use future data for the creative part? For example, to predict next week of 9/7 can we use the information of 9/8? Can we use a bi-lstm for example?

  No, I don't think that would be allowed since 9/8 is the future of 9/7. If you wanted to use the data of 9/6 instead of 9/8 that would be fine though.
