  The textbook math notation is unreasonably difficult at times and I can't understand some of the content because of it. Are there any workarounds to this or should I work on math notation?

  If you have specific questions about the notation in the textbook you can feel free to ask, but beside that I'm not sure what workarounds might look like.

  Unfortunately, I have to agree with Michael that this sort of opaque notation is something that can't be avoided.  I usually look to online resources first to set up a baseline understanding before tackling the textbook's descriptions, which helped a lot during the course.  It might also be useful to make sure you never read it without a pen and paper nearby, to walk through every step yourself - while skimming is tempting, you'll soon be overwhelmed by formulas if you don't break everything down as soon as it shows up and ensure that at least the only confusing thing on every line will be the new material.
