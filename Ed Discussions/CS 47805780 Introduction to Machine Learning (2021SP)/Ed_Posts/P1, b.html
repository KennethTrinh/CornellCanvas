 I know that I(i, j) us the index of the i^th nearest neighbor of vector xTe[j], so like I(3,1) is the index of the 3rd nearest neighbor of xTe[1], but what is the intuition behind I(0,0) or I(0,1). Is that the 0th nearest neightbor? Is it closer than the first nearest neighbor?

  I think that was probably a typo in the question. I think I(0,1) is supposed to be the index of the first nearest neighbor of xTe[1], I(1,1) is the second nearest neighbor, etc.
