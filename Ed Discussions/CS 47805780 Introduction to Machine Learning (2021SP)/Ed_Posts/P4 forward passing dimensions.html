 For forward passing, the dimension of the first weight matrix is 2*20 and we use the row representation that means we have 2 weight vectors each with length of 20. But xTr has a dimension of 100*2. I am confused about how xTr fits into 20 nodes or am I interpreting the problem wrong?

  Think about the dimensions, xTr is 100*2, suppose you have W 2 * 20, the result is 100 * 20, which is what we want for the next layer.

  If that does not make sense, try first without the "100", but think of an individual sample. x has 2 dimensions, we want to have 20 "results" by weight x1 and x2 differently and sum them. Naturally, we want 20 groups of such weights, each with 2 entries (w1, w2). Given the row representation of vectors, this means we want a 2*20 matrix for all these weights.

    So do we use normal matrix multiplication for this instead of element-wise multiplication?

     Yes, I used matrix multiplication
