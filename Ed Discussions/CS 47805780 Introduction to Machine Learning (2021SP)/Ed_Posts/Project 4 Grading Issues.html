 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 There are currently some weird issues with Vocareum, that your project 4 total score and final_score may display a zero, even if the submission report shows a non-zero score.
</p>
<p>
 No need to worry about that -- we will be going over all submissions after the late submission deadline, and make sure you get the correct total score.
</p>
<p>
 The correctness and competition scores should be correct, and they reflect the final scores you are getting.
</p>
<p>
 Thanks and sorry for the inconvenience.
</p>

  Hi, Tianxing
 </p>
 <p>
  I'm still getting 0/100 for the total score and my correctness score is 90/100. I used late submission, is this the problem that I have a 0 score?
 </p>

   It should be updated now.

   My submission report has been processing for ~30 minutes, and my scores have not been updated. What should I do about this?

    This is very strange... I would suggest you to backup your work locally, and then reset the Vocareum workspace with the starter code.

     I just saved my code locally and reset the assignment. I then tried submitting the assignment without any of my code (just the empty assignment), and the submission report still is not loading. After ~2 minutes of processing, I see this when trying to view my submission report:
    </p>
    <figure>
     <image height="399" src="https://static.us.edusercontent.com/files/Ea2aawyJbAlJoWW8gQi4JHbY" width="546"/>

     <image height="288" src="https://static.us.edusercontent.com/files/OOEpJmESHSL6iKdmFzCh6esp" width="542"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
     Also, I have already completed all portions of the assignment except for the competition section - if we cannot resolve this issue by the end of today, can I send my code to a TA so that you all could grade my assignment by running my code on your end?
    </p>

    Hi,
   </p>
   <p>
    I am still experiencing this issue. My total score is 0/100 even though my correctness score is 90/90

     Hi I believe I am still experiencing this issue. I have resubmitted but my final score still shows 0 when correctness score shows 90/90.

       We are currently working on this. No worries your correctness and competition scores should be correct. We will make sure you are getting the right final score.

       I'm still getting 0/100 even though I have most of the correctness points. Is this intentional? I haven't attempted the competition yet.

        Could you try to resubmit again now?
