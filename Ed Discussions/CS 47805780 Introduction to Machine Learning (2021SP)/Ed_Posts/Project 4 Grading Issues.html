  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  There are currently some weird issues with Vocareum, that your project 4 total score and final_score may display a zero, even if the submission report shows a non-zero score.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  No need to worry about that -- we will be going over all submissions after the late submission deadline, and make sure you get the correct total score.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The correctness and competition scores should be correct, and they reflect the final scores you are getting.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thanks and sorry for the inconvenience.

  I'm still getting 0/100 even though I have most of the correctness points. Is this intentional? I haven't attempted the competition yet.

  Hi I believe I am still experiencing this issue. I have resubmitted but my final score still shows 0 when correctness score shows 90/90.

  My submission report has been processing for ~30 minutes, and my scores have not been updated. What should I do about this?

  This is very strange... I would suggest you to backup your work locally, and then reset the Vocareum workspace with the starter code.

  I just saved my code locally and reset the assignment. I then tried submitting the assignment without any of my code (just the empty assignment), and the submission report still is not loading. After ~2 minutes of processing, I see this when trying to view my submission report:

  Also, I have already completed all portions of the assignment except for the competition section - if we cannot resolve this issue by the end of today, can I send my code to a TA so that you all could grade my assignment by running my code on your end?

  Hi, Tianxing
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I'm still getting 0/100 for the total score and my correctness score is 90/100. I used late submission, is this the problem that I have a 0 score?
