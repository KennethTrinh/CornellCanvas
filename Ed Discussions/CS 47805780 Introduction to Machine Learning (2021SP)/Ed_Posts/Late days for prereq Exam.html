 I am finding the prereq exam a bit time consuming due to having to reteach myself some mathematical concepts I've forgotten. Additionally, the problem set for CS 4820 is also due on Thursday. Is this assignment eligible for the free late days we have allotted? If so, how many days can we use for this single assignment? (if any)
</p>

  As listed in the FAQ, "Reminder that it is due on
  <b>
   Wed Feb 17 at 5pm EST
  </b>
  , but that the extension goes to
  <b>
   Thurs 5pm
  </b>
  . This extension
  <i>
   does not count
  </i>
  towards the extension days you get for homeworks in this class! The prereq exam is not a homework."
 </p>
 <p>
  The assessment is not eligible for any extra free days after Thursday, though.

   If we turn in the exam on the extension day (before
   <b>
    Thurs 5pm
   </b>
   ), will there be points off due to the late submission?

    Nope, no points will be taken off. The extension days are meant for you to take extra time on assignments if you need it without penalty.
