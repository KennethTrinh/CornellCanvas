 Are we supposed to modify initweight?  Would this affect the testing result of Forward pass?
</p>
<p>
 The function seems complete to me.  If it is possible could I get a hint on this?

  Or do we need to consider different cases for different activation type?

  You don't need to modify initweights. Functions that should be modified are marked with ## TODO.
