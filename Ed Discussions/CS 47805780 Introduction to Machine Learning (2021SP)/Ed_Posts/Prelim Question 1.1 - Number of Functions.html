  This question tells us the size of each feature vector, the possible values for each entry, and the possible values for the class label. I know how to count the number of possible feature vectors, but why is the final answer 4^30 instead of 30^4?

  To answer with math first, the general formula for the number of functions that map from a set X to a set Y is |Y|^|X|.

  To give intuition, for each element in X, there are |Y| many choices for a label.
