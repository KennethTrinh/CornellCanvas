 This error occurs frequently (but not always) - is there anyone who has similar errors (and have thoughts on what may cause this?)

  This command is used to save a copy of the jupyter notebook as a python file so we can run automatic AI detection on your submissions. I'm not sure why this error is occurring, but I'll look into it.
