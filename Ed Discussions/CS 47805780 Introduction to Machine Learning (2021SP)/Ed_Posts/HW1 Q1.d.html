 Why is the version space equal to 2^(12-5)? Where did the 5 come from? Is it the number of training examples?

  We know that the hypothesis space is size $2^{12}$. However, this includes many hypothesis which map the 5 instances in the table to the incorrect/inconsistent label. Since the version space is the set of all consistent hypotheses, we must remove all the hypotheses mapping these to the wrong label. There is a 2:1 ratio for each feature vector in the table from hypothesis space to version space - 2 in the hypothesis space since labels are binary, and 1 in the version space since only one is correct. Since there are 5, we must therefore divide by 2 five times (divide by $2^5$).
 </p>

  Another way to think about this is that we have already decided the labels for these instances. Since we started with 12, there are 12-5= 7 remaining labels for which the label doesn't matter (there are two possible consistent labels for). So there are $2^7$ total consistent classifiers.
