  According to the slides, $W^{t+1} \leq (1/2) * W^{t} + 0.5(1/2)W^{t} = (3/4)W^{t}$. How does this make sense? Let's say that on a timestep 2, all algorithms except the first one predict correctly.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  So $(W_{h1})^2 = 1/2 * (W_{h1})^2$ and for all other hypotheses $(W_h)^2 = (W_{h})^1$.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If there were 10 hypotheses then, $W^{2} = ((10-0.5)/10) W^1$. The fraction occurs since the total weight was only reduced by 1/2.  which is greater than (3/4)W(t). Where is the mistake in my understanding?

  The part you're missing is the 3rd bullet of the slide: "on every MISTAKE". In the example you gave, each hypothesis had equal weight, and only one was wrong, so the majority vote was correct (not a mistake).
