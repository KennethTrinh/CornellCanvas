  I don't understand what question 2b means when it says "give its equation in the form w1x1 + w2x2 = b". Should I like plug in my w vector and bias term into this equation? If I do that and put in test points for x, the left hand side of the equation doesn't equal the right for all of the points. Alternatively, if I use this to evaluate then am I doing something like w1x1 + w2x2 - b and seeing whether the equation yields something that is positive/negative?

  If the weight vector is $\vec{w} = \langle w_1,w_2 \rangle$ and the bias term is $b$ then you would just plug it into the first equation you described. There is more than one solution, you just need to come up with a weight vector and a bias term that correctly classifies all the points in the diagram.
