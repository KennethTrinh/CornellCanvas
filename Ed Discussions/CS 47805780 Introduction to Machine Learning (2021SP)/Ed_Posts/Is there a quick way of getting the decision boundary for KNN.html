 I was working on homework 1 problem 2, and I couldn't think of a way to get the decision boundary other than trying to find many individual point that might be on the decision boundary, and then connecting them with lines. Is there a more efficient way of getting a decision boundary?

  I wouldn't say there's one super easy way, but one thing I recommend is to consider the line that's equidistant from any pair of points and work with that to start building a boundary.
