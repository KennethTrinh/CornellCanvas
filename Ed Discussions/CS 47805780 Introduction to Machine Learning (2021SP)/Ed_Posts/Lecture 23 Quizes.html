 I just got into the class but am unable to complete the lecture 2 and 3 quizzes because they were due on the 17th at 10 am. Could these quizzes be unlocked for those of us who recently got into the course?

  We will not be reopening the quizzes. The lowest 4 quiz grades get dropped.

   Everything on Canvas was open to everybody on the waitlist, not just the students that were already enrolled (correct me if this is wrong - it is hard to test this as the instructor). But, as Lacy said, no big deal if you have missed it. The 4 lowest quizzes are dropped, and this safety net is there to cover these cases.
