 I was wondering where I can find the professor's office hours on the canvas website and also whether he has office hours opened for the semester.
</p>

 Thank you.

  I am typically hanging around in the zoom after the discussion section. After that, I head to my office hour zoom. Registration link is on my homepage, and will add that to the course calendar as well.
