 Could we have also simplified the probability statement at the bottom using the union bound? That is, Pr(the union of all the hypotheses being correct | nobody is psychic) &lt;= sum of the probabilities of each of the hypotheses being correct given that nobody is psychic?
</p>
<p>
 What is the reason that we simplified this probability using the complementary rule and then product rule, instead of the union bound?

  Union bound is a bound on the probability, not an exact value. I think generally if you can compute the exact probability that is preferred to just producing an upper bound on it.
