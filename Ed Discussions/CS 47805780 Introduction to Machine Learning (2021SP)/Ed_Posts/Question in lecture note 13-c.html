  For the example in convolutional neutral network, there are 6 filters in C1 and S2. How does the number of filters become 16 in C3?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Also, why the number of neurons is 120 in C5 and 84 in F6? Are they decided by the designer?

  The number of filters is set by the engineer choosing the CNN architecture, much like the fully-connected hidden layer sizes of 120 and 84.
