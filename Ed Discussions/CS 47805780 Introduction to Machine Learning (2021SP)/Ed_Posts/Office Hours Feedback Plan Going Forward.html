 Greetings Everyone,
</p>
<p>
 Hope you're all doing well. We realize nowadays can be a very stressful time, and not managing to get help during office hours can aggravate that. Therefore, going forward, there are two things to note that we believe will help make OH a better experience.
</p>
<p>
 First, we will try our best to set a fairly strict time limit of 12-min per person, to reach more people than we are currently.
</p>
<p>
 Second, we ask that you please write your topic/concern in as much detail as you can. We strongly recommend against using filler for the topic just because then we can group individual questions together and avoid the bottleneck of breakout rooms.
</p>
<p>
 Best and have a good Friday,
</p>

  This sounds good. My only feedback from the student perspective is that I end up joining multiple office hours back-to-back because I leave certain office hours equally as confused. It would be helpful if certain TAs could answer questions more directly, keeping in mind that many students in the room are already very confused, and giving super general advice in a group setting is probably not going to help, and I will have to go to more office hours and continue to clog up the queues. I understand that TAs don't want to "give the answer away" but there is a happy medium. I hope that makes sense!
