 Does Mcnemar's test have the ability to prove a classifier performs better than another if the difference is large enough or does it still only prove the 2 classifiers are significantly different?

  I don't believe McNemar's test alone is enough to conclude one hypothesis is better than another, just that the hypothesis errors are different. Once you've determined that they're different, you could perform a one-sided hypothesis test (which would be very similar) to definitively show one was better than the other.
