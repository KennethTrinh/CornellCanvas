<p>
 Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe some of the function specifications are incorrect. For example, in cross_validation, input yValid is described as nx1, but the test block of code in fact inputs a list of length n.

 A similar mistake was made on a previous project (
 <a href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/4342/discussion/304732">
  #354
 </a>
 ) and it took me a long time to figure it out. In the future could this please be checked?
