  When we use the formula |err_s(h)-err_p(h)|&gt; epsilon/2
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  so for this problem 3b(i) epsilon/2=0.1----&gt;epsilon=0.2
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  But I don't know why I ask TA in Office hour, they said epsilon=0.1. I don't think that makes sense, and I think the answer key might be wrong.

  Yes, 0.1 should line up with epsilon / 2 (this problem was recently corrected in our solutions, so you probably spoke with a TA before they were aware of that)
