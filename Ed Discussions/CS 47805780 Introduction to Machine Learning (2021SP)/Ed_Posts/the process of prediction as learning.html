  What does the "learner" box represent? Is that representing the validation step, where we use a validation dataset to validate our hypothesis and choose the optimal # of parameters? Or something else?

  The learner step represents an iteration of our model training, wheref or some S_train we expose to the model, the weights of the model get updated, and it produces a new set of weights. Since our hypotheses are parameterized by our weights, this is equivalent to producing a new hypothesis.
