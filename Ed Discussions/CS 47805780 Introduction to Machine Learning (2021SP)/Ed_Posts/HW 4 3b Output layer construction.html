 How does the output layer in hw 4 Q3b function? I don't find any details regarding the relationship between the fully connected layer and the output layer in the question. Can we assume that the output layer is also fully connected?

  I had the same question. Was this answered elsewhere? If so I can't seem to find it.

  Yes, an output layer is simply a fully connected layer that doesn't (necessarily) apply the NN's activation function.
