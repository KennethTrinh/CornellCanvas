 Does this question ask of us to create a neural network for each of the outputs or only one for both of the outputs? Also, can we use a linear combination instead of a ReLU unit as a hidden node?

  You are asked to give a single neural network that takes in both x1 and x2 and gives two 1D outputs y1 and y2, using a single hidden layer.

 <p>
  CORRECTION:  You are
  <i>
   not
  </i>
  limited to just using ReLU nodes in your hidden layer, you are just limited to at most 4 ReLU nodes in the hidden layer.  You may include in your hidden layer, for example, nodes that simply perform the linear combination and transfer that value to the output nodes.
