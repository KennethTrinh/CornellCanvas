  Whenever I attempt to run "K=computeK("linear",xTr,xTr)" to test my code I get a memory error that an array of size (100,100) cannot be allocated. I only multiply two matrices for this function and I do not know how I would further simplify this. This array also seems too small to use up the available memory. Is there something that I am missing here / can someone help me get an idea of what may be going wrong?

  You can use
  <bold>
   <code>
    l2distance
   </code>

  from l2distance.py as a helper

  I see how this wouldbe used for the radial basis function kernel, but why would it be used for the linear kernel?

  Are you using a numpy function to compute the matrix product?  (also feel free to make a private post with code if you want more specific feedback)
