 In the classification problem, is it asking us to predict if the sum of hospitalizations of the next 7 days is lesser/greater than previous 6 days + current day? Or if its comparing avg of next week w.r.t current day? Does week literally mean week numbers or just next 7 days?
 <break>
 </break>
 What is the exact specification of the prediction?

  It is asking if the number of hospitalizations on that date is less than or greater than the number of hospitalizations on the date one week in the future.
