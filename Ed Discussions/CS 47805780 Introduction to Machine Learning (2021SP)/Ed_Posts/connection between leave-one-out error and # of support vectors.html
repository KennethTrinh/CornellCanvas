 Why is it that, if our # of support vectors is small, then we can be sure our leave-one-out error will be small?
</p>
<p>
 I'm trying to understand this intuitively. Is it because, if we have a large number of support vectors, then there is a greater chance that more training examples are training errors, and so there is a greater chance that we have more leave-one-out errors?

  Basically, only the support vectors influence the decision boundary, so if we leave out something that isn't a support vector we know the decision boundary will remain unchanged and it won't be a loo (note misclassified points are support vectors).
