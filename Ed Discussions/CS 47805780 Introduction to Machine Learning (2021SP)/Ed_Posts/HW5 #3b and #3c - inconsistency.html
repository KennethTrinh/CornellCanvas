  Hello, I'm still a little confused on the reason behind why we used which probability bound in the above problems (HW5 #3b and #3c).
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I understand that, for #3bii, we can't use the generalization error bounds because the friend didn't see the sample set S or distribution P, and so we have to use Hoeffding's bound in this case.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  However, for #3bi, I don't understand why we can use the generalization error bounds without using a union bound.
  <italic>
   I thought that we could only use the generalization error bounds without using a union bound if the hypothesis we were looking at preserved randomness**
  </italic>
  . However, in #3bi, we are already choosing the hypothesis h_s that minimizes training error, so isn't there no more randomness here? How come we don't have to use union bound?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  **Note: I thought that we would have to use a union bound with our generalization error bounds if we were looking at a hypothesis that had no more randomness. This reasoning is consistent with the solution for #3c. This is another reason I am confused about #3bi, because whether or not we use a union bound seems contradictory to me for #3bi (not using union bound even though we no longer have randomness) and #3c (needing to use a union bound bc Tianyu's original argument no longer had randomness since he selected 1 hedge fund).

  I would appreciate any help, thanks!
