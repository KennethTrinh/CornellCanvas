 When it says a function F X E X A does it mean a function on x of all instance space -&gt; {yes, no} or does it mean that the function can only be expressed as "AND" of features. For eg, is a function with 'AND' and 'OR' togerther like (((flies = yes)&amp;(eggs =no)&amp;(aquatic = no)) OR ((flies = yes)&amp;(eggs = no)&amp;(aquatic = no))) a valid function?

  I think the question is asking about all possible functions mapping the instance into the binary space, so no prior is imposed (like only 'and' or 'or' type operations).

   Does it impose restrictions on whether all the features must be used in the hypothesis, or if a feature can be used more than once?

    This is a discrete feature space and we assume we know all possible values each feature can take. In such a setting the instance space is simply generated via a cartesian product of all unique attributes. The hypothesis space is then the set of all possible maps from this instance space that contains all combinations of attributes to {yes,no}. All features are used, but the instance space already has subsets that a hypothesis can map to the same constant as if a particular feature does not matter.
