 I scored 100% on all previous projects, so whatever I get on P5 will be replaced with a 100%. As such, I am planning on relaxing on the project and learning the concepts slowly over the weekend and through next week. But if I do so, I'm assuming it will eat into my remaining slip days, just based on the fact that I'm turning something in after the deadline.
</p>

 I was just looking to find out if this could negatively effect me in any way moving forward, i.e. will my slip days just expire after HWK5/P5, or can the be used on the final project / in any other way?

  You will not be able to use slip days on the final project or other assignments in the course. If you have enough slip days and want to use them, HW5 and P5 are the last assignments to use them on.
