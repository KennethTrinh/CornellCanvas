 I understand theoretically what it means to have a realizable setting; however, does this actually ever happen in practice, or is this more just for the purposes of theory?

  This is an interesting question, because really it comes down to how easy your X -&gt; Y relationship is (at least in the case of descriminative modeling). You can construct examples where this is arbitrarily true, ie your label is singular, but generally we won't be in a realizable setting.
