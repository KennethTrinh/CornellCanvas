  For part 4 of this question it asks to consider the OR function of two features Taste and Smell and determine the size of the hypothesis space. (So taste has 2 values, smell has 3, hypothesis space is 6). What would be the hypothesis space if it was AND instead of OR?

  It would still be 6, since there would still be the same number of choices for taste and smell.
