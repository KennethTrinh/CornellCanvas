 For the instance space, how should the superscript "2" be interpreted?
</p>
<math>
 X=\left\{+1,-1\right\}^2
</math>
<p>
 And how can the logical NOT function be represented with more than 1 input? Would it be a 1D linear classifier rather than 2D like AND?
</p>

  The way you would want to interpret the superscript would be that the instance space is the cartesian product of the set $\{+1,-1\}$ with itself. Or to be explicit,  $\{(+1,+1),(+1,-1),(-1,+1),(-1,-1)\}$.
 </p>
 <p>
  For the latter question, you are correct in that the NOT function is typically represented with 1 input. But can we extend a definition to the NOT function for multiple inputs? What if we classified the case where every input is $-1$ as $-1$ and then classified all other points as $+1$. This is similar to how Python handles boolean evaluation $False \leq 0$ and $True &gt; 0$. There are other ways to extend the definition of the NOT function onto multiple inputs, but the point is that it can be done!

   Ok, I think I understand. The parameters w and b that represent the NOT function linear classifier are not necessarily unique, right?

    Yes, a NOT function is (arbitrarily!) definable on 2 inputs. However, for the homework, we ask only for the AND function!
