  For question 3a, I see that we should refer to the soft-margin SVM definition for how to solve for the slack variables. However, in 08c-svm_softmargin I am only able to find bounds for these variables. Should we be using some other fact involving the slack variables in those slides? Is there something that I am failing to see? Thank you :)

  Ask yourself why do these slack variables exist in the first place? The answer is to make the otherwise failing constraints hold. By construction then, these slack variables are nonnegative and we want the smallest such slack variables such that the constraint binds (a constraint binds when it is an equality).
