  This is a follow-up to a previous question which I am still uncertain about : https://edstem.org/us/courses/4342/discussion/264784
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The question was as follows:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I just had a couple clarifying questions, is the new Hypothesis Space only limited to the sum of two attributes with a threshold at 0? Or, can you threshold at any number?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  With the following answer:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  As long as your hypothesis only uses the sum of two attributes to make predictions it should be fine.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  But this answer seems to suggest we would need to consider
  <bold>
   every
  </bold>
  possible hypothesis that only used the sum of two attributes to make predictions. Which would essentially mean we could have an infinite number of valid hypotheses.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Just to absolutely clear, am I correct to assume that we are supposed to find the functions g(A,B) where A+B &gt; 0 is marked yes / g'(A,B) where A+B&gt;0 is marked no? Otherwise not sure how we should choose the threshold.

  Yes, your assumption is correct: your solution should include only functions of the same form as g(A, B) and g'(A,B), and specifically use 0 as the threshold.
