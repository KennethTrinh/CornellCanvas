  You take the "majority vote" of the labels of the k nearest neighbors.

  Suppose you are running knn with k = 3. You have the set knn(x') of these 3 closest points. Say 2 of these nearest points have label A and 1 has label B. The set Y = {A,B}. So for each label y in Y, you count how many instances have that label (this is what the sum over the indicator function is doing). Then you output whatever label y maximizes this, in this case A.
