  For the competition is it okay to use the functions we wrote above? Also, since the grader is relying on our code, should we initialize our own list of C's and lambdas (sorry if this is super obvious). Thanks!

  1. yes, please feel free to initialize C and lambda 2. feel free to use previous functions as long as they are in the graded blocks (which makes sure it will be run on the grading system)
