  In HW4 Problem 3(b), for the fully connected (Full Conn.) "layer" in between the Flatten and the Output, I was wondering if it is a layer of
  <italic>
   <underline>
    nodes
   </underline>
  </italic>
  , i.e., a hidden layer of some number of nodes? Or whether it only contains
  <italic>
   <underline>
    edges
   </underline>
  </italic>
  that directly connect the Flatten layer and the Output layer, without any nodes at all? I have this question because I think the table in this problem is somewhat different from the figure and table representations used in the discussion last week.

  That fully connected layer should have corresponding nodes.
