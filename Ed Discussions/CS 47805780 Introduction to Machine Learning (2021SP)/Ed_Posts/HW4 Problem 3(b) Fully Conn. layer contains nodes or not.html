<p>
 In HW4 Problem 3(b), for the fully connected (Full Conn.) "layer" in between the Flatten and the Output, I was wondering if it is a layer of
 <i>
  <underline>
   nodes
  </underline>
 </i>
 , i.e., a hidden layer of some number of nodes? Or whether it only contains
 <i>
  <underline>
   edges
  </underline>
 </i>
 that directly connect the Flatten layer and the Output layer, without any nodes at all? I have this question because I think the table in this problem is somewhat different from the figure and table representations used in the discussion last week.

  That fully connected layer should have corresponding nodes.
