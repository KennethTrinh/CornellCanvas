 How is this proving that any Alg can be forced to make &gt;= log base 2 (n) mistakes? I understand what this illustration is representing and how the algorithm proceeds, but where does the log base 2 (n) come in?

  My understanding is that it comes from the depth. So if you look at 4 (the midpoint between 1 and 8, then each split is looking at the other relevant midpoints. The depth of the tree is 3 (the first is 4, the second is 2/6, and the third is 1/3/5/7. So they're saying, if you go down any one of these branches, you will at most make log2(n) so here log2(8)=3.
