  Hi!  Office hours were pretty packed - I tried saying in chat that I was going through a queue, but I don't think the message would've appeared if you joined after I said it and I think even after going overtime I didn't manage to get everybody.  Hopefully you got your question answered in the end, but if you still need help feel free to email me (ess239) and I can arrange more office hours! (I'm busy until 5pm, but can help after that)
 </p>
