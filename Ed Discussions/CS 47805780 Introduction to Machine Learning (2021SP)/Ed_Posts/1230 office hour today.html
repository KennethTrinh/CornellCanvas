  The zoom link in the calendar keeps showing that the meeting is not started by the holder yet. I am wondering whether it is still happening now. Besides, there was nobody in the 11:00 am OH after 12:20ish. I am not sure if I missed any announcements today. It would be very helpful if anyone knows what is happening now.
