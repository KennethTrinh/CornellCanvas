  Hi everyone,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  In order to alleviate stress and allow for a more comfortable schedule, we have decided to push back the final late-submission deadline by 2 days on each project going forward. This means that the late deadline for Project 1 is not Sunday February 28, but rather Tuesday March 2nd. This extended late deadline is effective going forward starting today.

  Does this late deadline affect our score or the free late days which we can use for assignments ?

  It means that you can use up to 4 late days for this project, not just 2 late days. After the late deadline, submission will be closed. Nothing else has changed.

  Was project 1 originally due on Fed 28? It still shows Fed 26 on Canvas.

  Canvas shows the regular due date. Feb 26th is still the official due date, the original late deadline was February 28th (i.e. you had 2 late days). Now you have 4 late days.

  One more question. If I need to use the late submission wildcard, do I simply submit it late or is there any procedure to go through?

  I think you'd just submit it and your total number of late days are reduced by the amount you use.
