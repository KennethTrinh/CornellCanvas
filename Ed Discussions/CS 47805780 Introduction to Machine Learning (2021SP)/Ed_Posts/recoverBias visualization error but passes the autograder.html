 My recoverBias visualization is off but it passes the autograder. I feel that this is causing downstream functions to work incorrectly. Any suggestions?

  I had a very similar problem. In my case it was caused by my dualqp being incorrect (despite both dualqp and recoverBIas passing the autograder).

   Do you remember which error you had in dualqp specifically? Was it about quad_form?

    What helped me was using as many "native" cvxpy functions as possible when calculating anything. So rewriting anywhere I was using np.func() with like an @ or multiply, etc. I hope this is helpful and not too vague...

     Could you be a little more explicit - which function did you implement these changes in?

      the arguments in quad_form specifically benefit from this treatment, but I found that writing my objectives and constraints following their
      <a href="https://www.cvxpy.org/tutorial/functions/index.html">
       operator rules
      </a>
      carefully was helpful too.

    It seems as if my bias is always offset by some number and that my w is correct.
