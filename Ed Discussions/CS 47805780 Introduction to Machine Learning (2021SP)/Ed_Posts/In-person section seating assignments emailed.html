 Hey everyone,
</p>
<p>
 If you are enrolled in an in-person discussion section, you should have received an email from your section TA giving you your seat number. Please do sit in your assigned seats as this is University policy.
</p>
<p>
 Looking forward to seeing you this week!

  Hello, I'm in the Thursday 1:30-2:20 discussion section at Goldwin Smith and I wasn't emailed a seat number (this may be because I switched discussion sections over the weekend to get an in-person one). What should I do to get a seat #?
 </p>
