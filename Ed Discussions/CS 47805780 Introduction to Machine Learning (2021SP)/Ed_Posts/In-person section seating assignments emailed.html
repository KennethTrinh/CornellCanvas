  If you are enrolled in an in-person discussion section, you should have received an email from your section TA giving you your seat number. Please do sit in your assigned seats as this is University policy.

  Hello, I'm in the Thursday 1:30-2:20 discussion section at Goldwin Smith and I wasn't emailed a seat number (this may be because I switched discussion sections over the weekend to get an in-person one). What should I do to get a seat #?
