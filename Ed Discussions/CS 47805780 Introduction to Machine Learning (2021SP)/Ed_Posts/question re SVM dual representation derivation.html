  Our optimization problem started as a minimization of our objective function, but then, once we introduced our Lagrange multipliers, we ended up adding a maximization to our objective function (now summed up with the constraints). How do we know that we want to maximize this resulting objective function?

  Basically what's going on here is that the outer min is choosing a w such that (1-y_i(w*x_i)) &lt;= 0 for all i, else you could pick an infinitely large alpha_i for the corresponding point i; effectively a_i is just encoding an enforcement of the linear constraint without the use of a s.t. term.

  Wait, so do we want to choose a small or large alpha_i?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Also, why do we add the "max" into the optimization problem?

  The max will either choose infinite or 0 alpha, depending on the value of the rest of the term, which is what forces the min to choose a good w. The max is effectively just the algorithm's way of encoding the y(wx+b)&gt;=... constraint implicitly.

  You might also take a look at 7.2 of

  https://mml-book.github.io/book/mml-book.pdf, which provides a nice intro to Lagrange multipliers.
