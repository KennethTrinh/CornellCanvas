  How did you preprocess the dataset and features, and how did you formulate the learning problem (or problems)?

  I'm confused by what "how did you formulate the learning problem (or problems)?" is asking to do.

  There is a number of design choices you need to make to get from the raw data that we gave you to something that you can feed into a learning algorithm. Some examples of design choices are how you transform and normalize the features, how you derive new features from the existing ones, how you split up the learning problem into potentially multiple components (e.g. multi-class to binary classification reduction), how you might want to transform the target labels or which loss function to optimize during training. These are just examples, and I am not saying that all of those are relevant for the current project. But, generally, we ask you to  explain and justify all the design choices you made.
