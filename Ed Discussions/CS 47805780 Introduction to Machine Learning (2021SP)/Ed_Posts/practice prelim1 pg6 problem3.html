  I'm not sure how to think about this problem. The squared loss is just larger in magnitude than the absolute loss, but both of them are positive, so I'm not sure what the difference and advantages of each would be?

  An advantage of squared loss is that its partial derivatives are continuous functions, whereas partial derivatives of absolute loss can jump, which is bad for computation. An advantage of absolute loss is that it's less sensitive to outliers.

  I see, thank you!

  But how is absolute loss less sensitive to outliers than squared loss? Is it because, in squared loss, the squaring magnifies any outliers there might be in the data?
