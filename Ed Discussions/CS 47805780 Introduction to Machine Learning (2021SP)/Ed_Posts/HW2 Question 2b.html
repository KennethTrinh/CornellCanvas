 For 2b we are asked to give two answers which both give a value for b, and this is somewhat confusing, as from what I understand they should have different signs. This question was asked here but the answer was ambiguous:

 Is there any chance someone could confirm whether it is or is not okay for our b to have different signs for the two answers?

  The standard form is $w_{1}x_{1} + w_{2}x_{2} + b = 0$, so please use this form. Apologies if this was not clear beforehand! Keep in mind that if you get a solution of the form $w_{1}x_{1} + w_{2}x_{2} = d$ where $d$ is a constant, then you should submit $b= -d$ as your result.
