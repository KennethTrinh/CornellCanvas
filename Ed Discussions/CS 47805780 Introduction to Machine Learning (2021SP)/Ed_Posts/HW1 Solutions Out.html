  Apologies! It's been a busy weekend. I hadn't realized we didn't release the grades after the grading session last week. They should be visible on gradescope (except for some of the later late submissions, which will be graded soon)

  We disable downloads on the solutions to try to prevent uploading of solutions to sites like coursehero. It's unfortunate, but please do your best to take notes/correct your own solutions with the view mode.
