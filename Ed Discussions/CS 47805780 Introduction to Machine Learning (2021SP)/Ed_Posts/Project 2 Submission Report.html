 Hi, so when I submit, the submission report gives me this at the end
</p>
<pre>[NbConvertApp] Converting notebook python_HW2_Perceptron.ipynb to script
[NbConvertApp] Writing 19082 bytes to python_HW2_Perceptron.py
../resource/scripts/submit.sh: line 5: vocSaveDataPublic: command not found
Command exited with non-zero status 127
</pre>
<p>
 Does this mean something failed while running? It looks like the competition score is 0.8+, but I didn't get any points for the competition. Is that supposed to happen?

  You can safely ignore that error message.

  You need a higher accuracy to beat our baseline :-)

   I also got this error message, but my total score now is 0/100... Is that  normal? (I got 95/100 earlier, and have not modified on anything before the "competition" section afterwards.)
