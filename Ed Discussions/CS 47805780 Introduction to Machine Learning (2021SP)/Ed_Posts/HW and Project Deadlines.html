  Will a schedule of HW and project deadlines (or at least tentative deadlines) be released? It would be helpful for planning purposes. Thank you!

  If all goes according to plan, we will be on a two week-cycle with homeworks and projects. Homeworks typically come out on Tuesdays and projects on Fridays. That means HW2 will come out next Tuesday, and P2 will come out next Friday. And this then repeats every two weeks for the total of 5 homeworks and 5 projects.

  Will HW2 be due before or after wellness days on 3/9-3/10? (I'm assuming deadlines cannot be on wellness days.)
