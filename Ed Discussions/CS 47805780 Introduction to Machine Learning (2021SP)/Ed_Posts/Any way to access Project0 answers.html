 Is there any way to access the answers to project 0? This was asked before with a TA answering in the negative, which doesn't sound right to me, as this is an ungraded practice project. If the intention of this project is to help us learn, it really seems beneficial for us to be able to look at the answers, especially considering that there is no way to check some of the problems through the project itself.

  I don't think they're letting us see it since its implementation is required as the first part of P1. (I think the rationale behind assigning P0 in the first place was to get us used to Vocareum)
