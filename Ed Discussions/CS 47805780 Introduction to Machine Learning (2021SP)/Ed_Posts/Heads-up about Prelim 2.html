 As you already know, our second prelim is scheduled for Thursday, April 29, which is two weeks from today. While more details will follow, here is the basic information you need to plan ahead.
</p>
<p>
 No matter whether you are taking the exam in-person or remotely, the exam will be proctored and you will have 2.5 hours to answer the questions. Collecting your answers is not included in this time in either version of the exam.
</p>
<p>
 Before we get to all the (mind-blowingly complex combinations of in-person, online, time-zones, SDS), let's first talk about the content of the exam. It will cover all lectures that have been released by the time of the exam, their associated reading, the discussion sections, homeworks 1-5, and projects 1-5. This means that the exam is cumulative, and it will cover the whole semester -- not just what we did since Prelim 1. The type of exam questions will be similar to those on Prelim 1, and you can now use a two-sided cheat sheet.
</p>
<p>
 To make sure you have time to prepare for the exam, we will keep the week of Prelim 2 wide open for review. First, no new material will come out the week of Prelim 2. Second, the last project and homework are due well before the exam - at least a full week. But to make sure you don’t get bogged down in finding the last bugs in your Project 5, we don’t count the wellness days as late days and we have extended the late-submission deadline for Project 5 until the Friday after Prelim 2. But make sure you understand the concepts covered in Project 5, since they are relevant for the exam. Third, the discussion section in the week of the prelim not cover new material. In fact, we cancel the regular discussion section and instead have a review session on Wednesday, April 28, at 10:00am (
 <a href="https://cornell.zoom.us/j/94908400712?pwd=NWJvU1g1QVYvSmt2SlZWWFBsd3J4QT09">
  https://cornell.zoom.us/j/94908400712?pwd=NWJvU1g1QVYvSmt2SlZWWFBsd3J4QT09
  ). We will release additional exam practice questions that we can go over in this session.

<p>
 So, now let's get into some of the logistics.
</p>
<p>
 If you are enrolled in section 206, you will be taking the exam online with remote proctoring. To be enrolled in Section 206, you must either be officially registered as "not in Ithaca" with the university, or have SDS accommodation to take the exam online.We will send you detailed instructions on how to set up your computer for the exam. But you can already plan on a few things: you will have to write your answers on paper, and you will need a scanner within view of your computer camera or a scanning app for your phone (e.g. Genius Scan) that produces a multi-page PDF of your answers . Furthermore, you will need a MacOS or Windows computer with a camera and Zoom installed (not ChromeOS, or Linux, or anything else). If you are located in a time zone that does not allow you to take the exam at the regular time (6:30pm Ithaca time), please contact Lacy Jordaens (lsl92@cornell.edu) by 4/19.
</p>
<p>
 If you are enrolled in any other section, you will be taking the exam in person. We will send you instructions about location and procedures later. If you have a conflicting exam that does not allow you to take the exam at the regular time (6:30pm), please contact Lacy Jordaens (lsl92@cornell.edu) by 4/19.
</p>
<p>
 If you need to change your exam modality, please follow the university process on changing your "in Ithaca" vs. "not in Ithaca" status. If your status change was approved by the university and this requires a change in exam modality, let Lacy Jordaens (lsl92) know. In general, we follow the university rules on who is eligible for a remote exam, so please be careful in following these rules (including, but not limited to what is on
 <link href="https://covid.cornell.edu/students/instruction-modes/"/>
 https://covid.cornell.edu/students/instruction-modes/
 ). For example, travel (and any mandatory quarantine resulting from that) is not recognized by the university as a reason for a remote exam, unless you received an approved exemption.
</p>
<p>
 No matter whether you are taking the exam in-person or remote, we will make sure to provide you with any SDS accommodation you have submitted to us.
</p>
<p>
 More detail will follow later, but this should be all you need to know to plan and prepare for the exam.

  You should have received an email confirming your exam modality from me by now. If you have not please email me at lsl92@cornell.edu. S/U and AUD will not have received an email as you are not eligible for the prelim.
