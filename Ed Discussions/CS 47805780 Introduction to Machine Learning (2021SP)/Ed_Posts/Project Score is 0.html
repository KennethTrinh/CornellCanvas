 I'm getting a 0 on my recorded score for Project 4 even though the submission report says final score is 100. I saw in
 <a href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/4342/discussion/352346">

 </a>
 that someone was having an issue, but I implemented the competition part and I'm still getting the error. Has anyone else run into this and had any other solutions?

  Are you getting an error of some sort or just the 0 score?

   I have the same issue and I get no errors in the submission report just the 0 as the final score.

    I get no error, the submission report basically says
   </p>
   <p>
    .....
    <break>
    </break>
    Your correctness score is 90/90
    <break>
    </break>
    <break>
    </break>
    .....
    <break>
    </break>
    Your competition score is 10/10
    <break>
    </break>
    <break>
    </break>
    .....
    <break>
    </break>
    Your final score is 100/100
   </p>
   <p>
    But the grade in the grading tab for "Total Score" is 0, and the grade that was uploaded to canvas was a 0.

     Ok so I removed a print statement and now it worked? But I don't know if just arbitrarily submitting again fixed the issue or if the print statement had anything to do with it (although it seems unlikely that a print statement will break everything?)

      It's not unheard of that print statements can mess with an autograder
