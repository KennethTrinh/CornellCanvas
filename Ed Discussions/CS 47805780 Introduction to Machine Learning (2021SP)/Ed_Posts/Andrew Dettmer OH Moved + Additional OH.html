  Hi all,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I'm moving my weekly Saturday OH slightly earlier to 2-4 pm.  I'm hoping to be able to give students who are taking a slip day for projects more time between meeting with a TA and the deadline at 5pm.  I'm also adding an additional hour on Thursday nights 9-10 pm.
