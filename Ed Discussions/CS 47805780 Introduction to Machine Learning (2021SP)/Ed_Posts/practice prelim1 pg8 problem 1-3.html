 For the second problem above, I'm unsure how I would define the separating hyperplane in terms of h_w.
</p>
<p>
 I know h_w(x) = sign(w' dot (x_i)'), where w' = (w,b) and x'=(x,1), and I think the separating hyperplane would just be given by (w' dot (x_i)'), but I'm not sure how I would define the separating hyperplane in terms of h_w, since h_w involves the sign function.
</p>
<p>
 Moreover, for the third problem above, would we just change the function for regression by taking away the sign function, so that our h_w(x) becomes h_w(x) = (w' dot (x_i)'), where w' = (w,b) and x'=(x,1) ?

  You are right for the second part: using w' and x' is enough. And yes for the third problem.

   I see. But, for the second problem, I'm not sure how I would define the separating hyperplane in terms of h_w then?

    Actually, I dont really understand what the second question is getting at. I did not make that question, so feel free to ignore.

    Can you elaborate on how you come to the third answer?
