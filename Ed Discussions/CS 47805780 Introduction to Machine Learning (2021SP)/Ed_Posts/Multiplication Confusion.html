 I know this is addressed in P-1, but I am still confused on when to use:
</p>
<p>
 A.dot(B)
</p>
<p>
 A@B
</p>
<p>
 A*B
</p>
<p>
 multiply(A,B)
</p>
<p>
 Any insight would be appreciated.
</p>

  I assume A and B are numpy arrays or scalars here.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  np.dot(A,B) infers what to do based on the dimensions of A and B. Here is what the numpy documentation says about np.dot(A,B):
 </p>
 <list style="bullet">
  <li>
   <p>
    If both A and B are 1-D arrays, it is the inner product of vectors (without complex conjugation).
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    If both A and B are 2-D arrays, it is matrix multiplication, but using numpy.matmul or A @ B is preferred.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    If either A or B is 0-D (scalar), it is equivalent to multiply and using numpy.multiply(A, B) or A * B is preferred.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    If A is an N-D array and B is a 1-D array, it is a sum product over the last axis of A and B.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    If A is an N-D array and B is an M-D array (where M&gt;=2), it is a sum product over the last axis of A and the second-to-last axis of B
   </p>
  </li>
 </list>
 <p>
  <break>
  </break>
  A @ B will be conventional matrix multiplication. It is semantically equivalent to numpy.matmul(A, B). Make sure A has dimensions m x n and B has dimensions n x p. The result will have dimensions m x p.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  np.multiply(A,B) is element-wise multiplication if A and B are same size matrices, and a scalar-matrix product if either A or B is a scalar, with the other being a matrix. (i.e. the scalar A is multiplied to every element of B).
  <break>
  </break>
 </p>
 <p>
  A * B is semantically equivalent to numpy.multiply(A,B)
 </p>
 <p>
  <break>
  </break>
  Hope this clarifies things a bit.
