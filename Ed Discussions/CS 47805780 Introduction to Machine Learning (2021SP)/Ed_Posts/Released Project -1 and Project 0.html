  Hello everyone,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Projects -1 and 0 are now released on Vocareum. You can find them on Canvas - Modules - Project 0/-1, which will direct you to Vocareum. These two projects are optional and will not be graded. Also, they will remain open without due date.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  These two projects serve as tutorials for you to familiarize yourself with Numpy. They are highly recommended since they will be very helpful throughout this semester. There is no official grading script for these projects, so clicking "Submit" will simply generate a report that runs the notebook; however, there are inline tests and assertions that will help you check your work.

  Have fun :)

  Vocareum has a notice suggesting I need to pay to maintain access? Is this something I'll need to buy?

  Yes, you need to pay $30 to access Vocareum :-(.

  You're paying for access. Those who do not pay will not get continued access to Vocareum throughout the semester, unfortunately.
