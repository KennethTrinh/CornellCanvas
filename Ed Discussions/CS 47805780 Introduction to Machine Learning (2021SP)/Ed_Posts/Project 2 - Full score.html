  In order to get the full score, does our code have to score beyond 97% on every run? Sometimes mine doesn't hit the threshold so I was wondering if I submit and it hits beyond 97% it would be enough.

  Our general policy is that the grade received on your last submission is the grade you get for the assignment.  If you are finding that percentage you get each time you submit is inconsistent, I would definitely recommend going through and finding areas where you could adjust your approach (although this is not required for full credit if your final submission is &gt;97%).
