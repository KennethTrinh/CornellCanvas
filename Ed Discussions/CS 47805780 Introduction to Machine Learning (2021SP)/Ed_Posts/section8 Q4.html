  We ran out of time during last week's section, and did not finish the last question. Are there solutions/notes posted anywhere that I can refer to? Will help a lot on the homework. Thanks!

  The entries relevant to the solution are already part of the handout. Try working through the Viterbi algorithm to see if you're getting the same numbers.
