 I'm often told in lectures that a problem is a convex optimization problem. How do I know if a problem is a convex optimization problem?

  This is a tough question that doesn't really have a simple answer unfortunately. To know a problem is a convex, it's constiuant constraints and objectives must be convex, which you would only know by proving that they are. In general, convexity is kind of something you associate with certain optimization problems not something you intuitively deduce.
