  Are we allowed to set an activation function for the two output nodes in the output layer of our neural network for 2b?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  And are we allowed to use the ReLU function as the activation function?

  The output nodes should not have activation functions

  If we wrote Lin(nodes added together) then that would count as an activation function but without the Lin then it would be fine? Or is it fine with Lin as well?

  To confirm, $y_1$ and $y_2$ are only to output the value of $w_{11} * v_1$ and $w_{12} * v_2$ then? They are not allowed to modify these values in any way? ($w_{ij}$ and $v_k$ are both vectors)

  yep, the ys should be linear combinations of the zs
  <break>
  </break>
  you can choose what the weights connecting the zs to each y should be though

  For some cases we have seen output of sign(combination of zs), since sign is an activation function then how do we know when to use an activation function on the output vs when not to do so and just use a linear combination?
