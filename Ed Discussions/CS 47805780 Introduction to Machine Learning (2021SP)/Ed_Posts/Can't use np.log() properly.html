  I did something like np.log(posprob/negprob) in Project 5 using posprob and negprob from function naivebayesPXY_mle(), but it gave me an error message saying that "loop of ufunc does not support argument 0 of type DivExpression which has no callable log method". But when I do np.log(pos/neg) that's fine. (pos/neg are outputs from naivebayesPY()). Why does this happen? How should I fix it?

  Is it a divide by zero issue? I had to filter out zero values before calling np.log
