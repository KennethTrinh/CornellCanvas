 Hi all,
</p>
<p>
 If you have any class-related questions, ED is the best platform to reach out to us, as both professor and I are able to see and respond to the questions. Your questions may also help others in the class, and you may get useful information from others' questions.
</p>
<p>
 Asking questions through my personal social media account like Wechat may not be the best option as you might also want to get the prof's feedback or your classmate's feedback.
</p>
<p>
 Thank you.
</p>
<p>
 Best,
</p>
