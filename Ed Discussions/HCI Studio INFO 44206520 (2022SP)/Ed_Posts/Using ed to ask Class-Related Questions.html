  Hi all,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If you have any class-related questions, ED is the best platform to reach out to us, as both professor and I are able to see and respond to the questions. Your questions may also help others in the class, and you may get useful information from others' questions.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Asking questions through my personal social media account like Wechat may not be the best option as you might also want to get the prof's feedback or your classmate's feedback.

  Thank you.
