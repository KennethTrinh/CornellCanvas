 I have received many questions about the registration process for this course. As in the past, students will be registered at once after having settled on a group and a project topic (the general topic for the class is: "How to make the world a better place").
</p>
<p>
 If we were to reach a point where the enrollment is bigger than we can manage, I give priority to students:
</p>
<list style="ordered">
 <li>
  <p>
   who need the class to graduate this semester;
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   for whom this is the last time they can take the class;
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   two applied in the past but did not get in;
  </p>
 </li>
</list>
<p>
 I am expecting to send the PIN around Feb 2.
</p>
<p>
 Francois.
