  I have received many questions about the registration process for this course. As in the past, students will be registered at once after having settled on a group and a project topic (the general topic for the class is: "How to make the world a better place").

 <paragraph>
  If we were to reach a point where the enrollment is bigger than we can manage, I give priority to students:
 </paragraph>
 <list style="ordered">
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    who need the class to graduate this semester;
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    for whom this is the last time they can take the class;
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    two applied in the past but did not get in;
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
 </list>
 <paragraph>
  I am expecting to send the PIN around Feb 2.
