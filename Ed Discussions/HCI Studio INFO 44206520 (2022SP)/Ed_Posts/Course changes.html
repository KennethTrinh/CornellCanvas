  Hello,
  <break>
  </break>
  Because of unforeseen conflicts, the course is going to change from a
  <bold>
   Mon-Wed
  </bold>
  to a
  <bold>
   Wed-Fri
  </bold>
  format (same time). Please let me know as soon as possible if this will create a significant problem for you.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Also, as you might have noticed the course will take place in Rhodes 100 when we will be back to an in-person teaching setting.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Finally, the Canvas site for the courses will be open a couple of days before our first meeting.
