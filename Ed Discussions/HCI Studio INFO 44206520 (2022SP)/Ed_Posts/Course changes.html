 Hello,
 <break>
 </break>
 Because of unforeseen conflicts, the course is going to change from a
 <b>
  Mon-Wed
 </b>
 to a
 <b>
  Wed-Fri
 </b>
 format (same time). Please let me know as soon as possible if this will create a significant problem for you.
</p>
<p>
 Also, as you might have noticed the course will take place in Rhodes 100 when we will be back to an in-person teaching setting.
</p>
<p>
 Finally, the Canvas site for the courses will be open a couple of days before our first meeting.
</p>
<p>
 Francois.
