 Hi Professor, there are career fair events happening during class time on Wednesday and Friday. May I go for them for a while and then return to the class? Thanks

  Hello,

  The fair is from 11:00am to 4:00pm so there is plenty of time outside of class to attend except of course if you have a scheduled interview.
