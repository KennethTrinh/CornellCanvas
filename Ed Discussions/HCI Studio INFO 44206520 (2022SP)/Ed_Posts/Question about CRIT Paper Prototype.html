  Since we will have a digital presentation on Wednesday for CRIT, we wonder if we still need a physical paper prototype if our solution is mostly web-based. Thank you.

  I will encourage you to work with a paper prototype nevertheless, as this approach is encouraging exploration, and makes it clear that one should not spend time in low level details.
