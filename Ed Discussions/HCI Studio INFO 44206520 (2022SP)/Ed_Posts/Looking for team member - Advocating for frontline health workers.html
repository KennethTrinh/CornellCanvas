 Hi all,
</p>
<p>
 Carrie (ck548) and I (jcm559) are
 <b>
  looking for one more person to join our team
 </b>
 . We're hoping to work on
 <b>
  advocacy for frontline health workers
 </b>
 (ie. the "essential workers" who were giving healthcare in peoples' homes during COVID). This project is part of a larger research project, which means we already have access to people to interview and it will likely result in a publication! Please let us know if you're interested :)
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Background:
 </b>
 Frontline caregivers do a lot of work that is “invisible,” which means they do not get paid for their effort/time nor do they get support/training related to those activities/skills.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Research Question:
 </b>
 How might technology play a role in making the work of frontline caregivers more visible so that they can advocate for more rights?
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Prior Work:
 </b>
 Joy has conducted interviews with 13 home health aides in New York City and 15 community health workers in India to understand what invisible work they do and how technology influences (or can influence) it.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Proposal:
 </b>
 Work with representatives from SEIU1199 who represent home health aides in NYC to figure out what data would be helpful to make visible and how technology might help with that. Since unions have experience advocating for frontline caregivers’ rights, they should have a sense of what information is important and what they need help with.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Outcomes:
 </b>
 I (Joy) would like to aim for publication for this (targeting a summer 2022 deadline for CHI). I would like to do the needs assessment, design/prototyping, and then ideally get some iterations done before the end of the semester, but I would be open to continue anything additional into the summer (though no requirement for others to continue).
