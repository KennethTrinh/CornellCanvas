  I have some questions regarding the grading criterion for the upcoming crit session.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1. As for goals, is it asking for the goals of this project holistically or the pilot interviews we've conducted?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. Does constraints mean constraints pertaining to the goals? As in the constraints that hinder the process of achieving our goal?

  In both case we are looking at the project holistically as this is a synthesis phase before the idea generation.
