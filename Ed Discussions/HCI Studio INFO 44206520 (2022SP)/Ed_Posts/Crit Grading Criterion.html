 I have some questions regarding the grading criterion for the upcoming crit session.
</p>
<p>
 1. As for goals, is it asking for the goals of this project holistically or the pilot interviews we've conducted?
</p>
<p>
 2. Does constraints mean constraints pertaining to the goals? As in the constraints that hinder the process of achieving our goal?
</p>

  In both case we are looking at the project holistically as this is a synthesis phase before the idea generation.
