 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 I think the readings for this week's INFO6520 are not posted on Canvas yet. I can see the discussion page of On Visual Design but there's no reading underneath. Thanks!

  Sorry about this, it seems that this assignment was not updated. Since this is so close to the deadline I removed it from the assigned reading.
