  Will the answer key be sent out again like the previous times? Also, sorry if I missed it, but will there be office hours before the final?

  The numerical answers of the practice problems will be posted on Sunday 12/12. In addition to Prof. Hammer’s office hours on Sunday, I will be offering office hours late Monday afternoon (12/13) over Zoom. I will email you with the exact time and a zoom link on Monday.

  Sunday office hours will be 3 or 4 until 6 pm.  I have had only 1 person express interest in starting at 3 pm by e-mail instead of 4 so far.  Please let me know!
