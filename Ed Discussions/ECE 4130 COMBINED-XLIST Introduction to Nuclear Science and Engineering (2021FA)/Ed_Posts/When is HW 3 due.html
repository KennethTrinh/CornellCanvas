 On the canvas page, it says that the hw is due on the 15th, while the assignment page itself says that the hw is due on the 22th. Which date is correct?

  Canvas is a very frustrating system.
 </p>
 <p>
  After this question was asked in class, I changed the due date of Assignment 3 in the Assignment Module and the assignment page
  <underline>
   due date to September 15
  </underline>
  , and uploaded a new assignment page, all before I left the classroom yesterday.  Somehow, the new assignment page did not upload even though I thought it had.
 </p>
 <p>
  I apologize for the confusion and thank you for calling it to my attention.  I will upload the corrected assignment page and send out an e-mail ASAP.
 </p>
