 I understand the reasoning behind this equation of absorption cross-section, but I am unsure of where to start to show a proof of this for this question. Do I describe the reasoning in words or is there an equation to start with to do mathematical steps to prove it?

  You would want to show this mathematically. You could first think about how you would write the macroscopic absorption cross section in terms of microscopic cross sections and then try to

  incorporate volume fractions into the equation.
