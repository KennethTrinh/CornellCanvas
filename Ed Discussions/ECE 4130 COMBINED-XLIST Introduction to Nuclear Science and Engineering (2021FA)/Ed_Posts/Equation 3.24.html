  In equation 3.24, how do we find the constants, C, for different atoms? ie how do we know if we can neglect this term or not?

  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Perhaps you've not yet discovered that the
  <underline>
   absorption cross section
  </underline>
  of water is given in Table II.3 in the back of the book.  Notice that this problem asks for the neutron absorption rate.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  You would expect to be able to calculate the cross sections of the H2O molecule by adding the cross sections of the constituents.  However, you cannot do that for the
  <underline>
   scattering cross
  </underline>
  <underline>
   section
  </underline>
  for this particular molecule (and a few other important ones).  Please see example 3.6 at the end of Section 3.3.   That's why it is in the table - it must be obtained experimentally.
