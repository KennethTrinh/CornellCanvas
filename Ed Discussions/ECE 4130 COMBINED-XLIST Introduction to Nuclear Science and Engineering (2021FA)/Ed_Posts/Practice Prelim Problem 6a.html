  For 6a I am trying to calculate the ratio. I think that the absorption rates will be proportional to the absorption cross section of U235 and U238. Currently I think it will be something like
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  epsilon/(1-epsilon) *sigma abs (U235)/sigma abs (U238). However, this is not yeilding the correct answer. Help?

  Are you using the cross sections from Table 6.1 since this is a Fast Reactor? - - Dave
