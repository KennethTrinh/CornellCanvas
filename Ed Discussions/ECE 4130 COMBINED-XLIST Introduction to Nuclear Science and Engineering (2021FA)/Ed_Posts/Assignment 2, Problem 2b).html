  In this question it asks us to find the macroscopic absorption cross section of SS-304. Are we supposed to find the microscopic absorption cross section required to answer this question online somewhere or do we take the weighted average of the cross sections of each of the component elements?

  The weighted average of the macroscopic cross sections is correct.  See, for example, the text above and below Eq. 3.14, which is for two species.  Generalize that to multiple species and you will be ready to do the calculation.

  Please bear in mind that the weighting factor is the number density, not the weight percent.
