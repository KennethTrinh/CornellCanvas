  In the textbook, for a nuclear reaction with a "p" in the parenthesis they used the mass of 1H in their calculations for the Q. Why is this? Doesn't this number include the mass of an electron not just the mass of a proton? Also, I'm unsure of how to handle the first part of this question. How is charge conserved if an electron is produced?

  In order to ensure the conservation of charge, you will need to add an extra electron to the left side of the equation. That is also why the mass of 1H is used instead of the mass of a proton — to account for the extra electron mass.
