  Dear NSE Students,
 </p>
 <p>
  The statistics were:
 </p>
 <p>
  Median: 74.5;  Mean: 68.6; Range: 39-89.5; Standard Deviation: 17
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, the range is from less than 2 standard deviations below to less than two standard deviations above the mean.  If the mean is ~ B+, then everyone is between B- and A.
 </p>
 <p>
  We will post a solution set shortly.
 </p>
 <p>
