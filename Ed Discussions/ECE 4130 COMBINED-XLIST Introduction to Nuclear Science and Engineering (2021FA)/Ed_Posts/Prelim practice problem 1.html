  I am confused on how to solve for A and Jo using the info given.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I am trying to use the equation for a finite cylinder
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  phi(r,z)=AJo(2.405r/R)cos(piz/H)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  but I do not know how to solve for A without the power. I am assuming the max flux can be used to find the power, but I keep going in circles always missing a variable. Can anyone help?

  Hi Zezette,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  In Practice problem 1, you are told what the maximum flux is. That occurs necessarily at (r=0, z=0) because that point is where Jo = 1 and cos(Ï€z/H) = 1.  The product of these two functions is less than 1 everywhere else.  If phi_max is at (0,0) then A = phi_max .  You can then evaluate phi at any other point (r,z).

  I hope that helps. -- Dave
