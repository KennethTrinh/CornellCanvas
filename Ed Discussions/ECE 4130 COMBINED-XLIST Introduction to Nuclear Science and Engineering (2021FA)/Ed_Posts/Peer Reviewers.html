  Where can we see our assigned peer reviewers? I do not see mine in Canvas. Will Yibei be emailing us?

  Did your paper submit correctly on Canvas? I think you need to do that first for Yibei to be able to assign you reviews.

  They should show up on the sidebar of the module:

  (Don't do the reviews in Canvas though. They should be a separate writeup, following the requirements outlined in the Peer Reviews Canvas module.)

  Thanks from me, too, Esther, for passing on the correct information about where to look for the peer reviews.
