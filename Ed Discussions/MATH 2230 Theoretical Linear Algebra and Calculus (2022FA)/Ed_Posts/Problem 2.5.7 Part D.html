  For Problem 2.5.7 Part D, how much detail are we expected to write? Is it sufficient to state the number of free/non-free variables, or must we compute a general solution to the system?

  You’re not being asked to compute the general solution.  Yes, you should say something about existence/non-existence of solutions and the number of free/non-free variables.  But is there anything else you can say about the solutions from the information you found in parts (b) and (c)?
