  For part c, is it okay to give an algorithm to construct the matrix for $P_n$ to $P_n$ by describing how each column can be constructed? Or does an explicit formula for the matrix have to be found?

  You can (and should) be pretty explicit in describing the entries of this matrix. If you want to inductively describe like what the entries of this matrix look like, that's fine, but you should definitely describe what the entries of this matrix are and not just describe how the entries can be constructed.
