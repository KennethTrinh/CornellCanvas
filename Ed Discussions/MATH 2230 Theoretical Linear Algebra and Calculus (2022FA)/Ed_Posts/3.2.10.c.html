 Now that HW10 was graded, does anybody have a solution for problem 3.2.10.c of the book? It wasn't corrected, so I guess it won't be in the solutions. Thanks!

  Here's a sketch: using the parameterization of the intersection of the surface with the $xz$-plane in b), consider the self-intersections of this curve. You can argue that the double points of this curve lie at infinitely many discrete values of $x$, which give the different cylinders that the self-intersection lies on when you revolve the $xz$-plane about the $z$-axis. Tracking the points of intersection as these points of intersection are revolved around the $z$-axis gives rise to the helixes mentioned in the problem.
