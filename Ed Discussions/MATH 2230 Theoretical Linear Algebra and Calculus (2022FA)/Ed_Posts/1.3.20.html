  In this problem we are thinking of complex numbers $z=x+iy$ as real vectors $\bigl(\begin{smallmatrix}x\\y\end{smallmatrix}\bigr)$.  So in a picture we would present the number $z$ as an arrow from the origin to the point with coordinates $x$ and $y$.

  Typically one would label the coordinate axes "$x$" and "$y$".
