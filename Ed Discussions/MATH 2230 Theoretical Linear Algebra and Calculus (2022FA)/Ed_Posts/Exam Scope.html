  Should we be comfortable using the augmented hessian matrix to classify constrained critical points? Or in actually finding the singular value decomposition of a matrix? In general, should we expect the exam to have many computational questions or will it be mostly all proofs?

  There will be a mix of computational and more abstract problems.

  We haven't practiced the augmented Hessian and you shouldn't expect it to be on the exam.  Singular value decomposition may be on the exam.  I placed a practice problem on the

  Exams page on Canvas.

  Regarding the Augmented Hessian, should we then expect there to be alternative methods to classify constrained critical points of functions in the exam? (Or maybe there are other criteria I'm not aware of)

  Sometimes the following method works.  Suppose you've found a constrained critical point $\mathbf{a}\in M$ of a function $f$ using Lagrange multipliers or whatever.  Suppose you are able to find a parametrization $\gamma$ of $M$, or of a portion of $M$ that contains $\mathbf{a}$.  Then the nature of the constrained critical point $\mathbf{a}$ can be determined from the unconstrained Hessian of the function $f\circ\gamma$.

  The portion of $M$ has to be a neighborhood of $a$ (over $M$, of course), right?

  Yes, the "portion of $M$" has  to be of  the form $M\cap V$, where $V$ is an open set in $\R^n$ that contains $\mathbf{a}$.
