 Do we need to use induction to show the closed formula of these sums, or can we use knowledge of sums of k and k^2 from i = 1 to n and algebra?

  Your choice: either use induction or use results established in class, discussion, or previous homework.  If you go the second road, try to give references ("by theorem so and so in the book...", or "by a result proved in recitation..."), so that the grader will understand what you are doing.

   ^ I agree! For what it's worth, my original solution when I did this problem uses the sums of the first k natural numbers/squares, but I would just cite where you got them from.
