  If we replace the stuff in the red circle with "at $\vec a$", why wouldn't the theorem still hold? For each $\vec a \in M$, we would know by the implicit function theorem that there is a neighborhood $V$ of $\vec a$ such that $M\cap V$ is the graph of a $C^1$ function of $k$ variables, so by definition, shouldn't $M$ be a $k$ dimensional manifold?

  Yes, it would still hold.  You can replace that line by "$DF(\mathbf{a})$ has rank $m$".

  So why did I write "$DF(\mathbf{x})$ has rank $m$ for every $\mathbf{x}\in M\cap V$"?  If  $DF(\mathbf{a})$ has rank $m$, then $DF(\mathbf{x})$ has rank $m$ for all $\mathbf{x}$ in some neighbourhood $V_0$ of $\mathbf{a}$ (which may be strictly smaller than $V$).  This is true because $DF(\mathbf{x})$ depends continuously on $\mathbf{x}$ (as $F$ is assumed to be $C^1$).  If $DF(\mathbf{x})$ has rank $m$ for all $\mathbf{x}$ in $M\cap V$, then you know that all of $M\cap V$ is a manifold, not just $M\cap V_0$.
