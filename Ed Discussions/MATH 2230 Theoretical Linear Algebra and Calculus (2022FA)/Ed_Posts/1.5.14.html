  If a limit approaches infinity, do we say the limit doesn't exist? (for example, f(x)=1/|x| as x-&gt;0)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The definition talks about the limit existing only if the function approaches a value in the closure of the codomain of the function, so I guess not, but I was used to saying the limit existed and was +infinity or -infinity.

  Thanks!

  $\pm \infty$ are not real values, so in these cases the limit should not exist.
