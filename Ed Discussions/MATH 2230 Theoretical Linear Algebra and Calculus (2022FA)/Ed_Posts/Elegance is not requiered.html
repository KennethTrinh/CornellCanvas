  For the book's proposition 1.5.14 (elegance is not required)
 </paragraph>

  Why does it not specify that the function u(e) must be positive for all epsilon?

  I think it definitely should. Maybe the statement means to say that "$u$ is a function of $\epsilon$ such that $u &gt; 0$," which seems sensible to me? I don't think that $u$ should ever be non-positive, because then I don't think the two given statements in that proposition are actually equivalent.
