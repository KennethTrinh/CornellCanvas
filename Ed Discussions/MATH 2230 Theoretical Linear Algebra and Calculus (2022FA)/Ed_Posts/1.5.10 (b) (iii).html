  I'm trying to compute e^A for
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  A=\begin{matrix}0&amp;a\\-a&amp;0\end{matrix}
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  I found a formula for each of A^{4k}, A^{4k+1}, A^{4k+2}, A^{4k+3} so I want to find a formula for
  <break>
  </break>
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  \sum_{_{k\ =\ 0}}^{\infty}\frac{1}{\left(4k+j\right)!}A^{4k+j},\qquad\qquad0\text{\leq j &lt;3}
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  and then add these four formulas together. But how can I find a formula for these series? Intuitively, I want to do a variable substitution $m = 4k + j$, and use the formula for $e^x$, but then I'm summing over a fraction $(m-j)/4$, which doesn't seem right. What can I do here?

  Try to simplify your formulas for $A^n$.  You should be able to find a single formula for $A^{2m}$ and a single formula for $A^{2m+1}$.

  Also have a look at the discussion of complex exponentials at the end of Section 1.5: it may give you some ideas.
