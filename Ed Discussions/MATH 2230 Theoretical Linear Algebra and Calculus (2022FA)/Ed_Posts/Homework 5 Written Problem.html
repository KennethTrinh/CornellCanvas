 In part ii we are asked to show that every polynomial in the set of all polynomials can be written as a linear combination of a finite set of bases. But what about functions like e^x and sin(x)? Since they can be written as polynomials, aren't they also in the set? If so, wouldn't they have an infinite degree and could not be represented by a finite set of bases?

  $\exp$ and $\sin$ are
  <i>
   not
  </i>
  polynomial functions.
