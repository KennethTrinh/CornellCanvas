     When submitting, if your submission has multiple pages, it's helpful to us if you assign the pages that have your answers to the questions in Gradescope. Please let us know if you have trouble doing this! You risk losing credit for your solutions if you do not do this.

     Please ensure you're recording your answers in a clear and legible/comprehensible fashion, especially if you are handwriting your solutions. As mentioned on the Canvas page, write your answers the way you'd like to see it in the textbook!
