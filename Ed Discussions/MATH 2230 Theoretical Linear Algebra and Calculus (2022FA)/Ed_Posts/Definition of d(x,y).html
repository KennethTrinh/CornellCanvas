   Take it to be 0. Any other choice breaks the first part of the problem as written (do you see why?).

   Edit: Actually, if it's not zero, this absolute value does not even define a metric on $\mathbb{Q}$, and I would very much like to be able to make a metric space out of this absolute value :))

    I'm almost certain that the problem needs to clarify that |0|=0. Also note that the definition is a bit ambiguous (even though it doesn't affect the metric), as a,b must be positive (for q not 0), not any odd integer.

     The definition of the metric does not use the values of $a$ and $b$, so it's actually fine, although I agree that the claim about uniqueness is at least somewhat dubious (it's only true up to sign basically).
