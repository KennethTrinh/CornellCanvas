  I'm almost certain that the problem needs to clarify that |0|=0. Also note that the definition is a bit ambiguous (even though it doesn't affect the metric), as a,b must be positive (for q not 0), not any odd integer.

  The definition of the metric does not use the values of $a$ and $b$, so it's actually fine, although I agree that the claim about uniqueness is at least somewhat dubious (it's only true up to sign basically).

  Take it to be 0. Any other choice breaks the first part of the problem as written (do you see why?).

  Edit: Actually, if it's not zero, this absolute value does not even define a metric on $\mathbb{Q}$, and I would very much like to be able to make a metric space out of this absolute value :))
