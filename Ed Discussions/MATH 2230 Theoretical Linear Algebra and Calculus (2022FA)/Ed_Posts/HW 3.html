  Will the grades for HW3, and possibly for HW 4, be released before the prelim exam? I want to review what I got wrong for the homework before the prelim exam, but they don't appear to be marked yet..

  Hi! I'm so sorry, HW3 should be out tonight. I've been really busy this past week and haven't had a chance to finish the grading.
