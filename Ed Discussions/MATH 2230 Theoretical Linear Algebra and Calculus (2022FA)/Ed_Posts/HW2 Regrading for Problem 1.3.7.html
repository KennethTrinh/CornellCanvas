  tl;dr I decreased the deduction on the rubric item for not being specific enough about what sets of three vectors were sufficient for $[T]$ to be determinable from the given information from -0.5 to -0.25. Reasoning given below.

  In general, when a problem asks one to articulate conditions for some statement to hold, I prefer answers that indicate the weakest logically equivalent statement one can make. Many students essentially said that "we need to use the images of the standard basis vectors." It's true that having the information of $T$ acting on the standard basis vectors is necessary and sufficient for $[T]$ to be determinable, but as mentioned in many of my comments, it's not the only set of inputs that can be used. As such, when the problem asks for "how much information we need," it's not a complete answer to simply talk about the standard basis vectors -- this is in particular a correctness issue.

  I originally based my grading for this question off of last year's rubric, which deducted this relative amount of points for answers that did not articulate that there were other possibilities, but since the language required to articulate this clearly requires vocabulary that somehow many of last year's students knew when doing this problem but probably hasn't been introduced in class yet, it seems a little unfair to grade according to the same rubric. As such, I have decreased this penalty, so many of the grades have increased by about 0.25 points. Hopefully that explains what's happened if you see your grade has changed since grades on PS2 were initially released!
