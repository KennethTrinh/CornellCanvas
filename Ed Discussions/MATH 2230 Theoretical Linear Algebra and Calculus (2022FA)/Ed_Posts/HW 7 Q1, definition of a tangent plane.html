  I didn't really explain this in class, but there will be some discussion of this tonight in recitation and we will return to the issue in chapter 3.

  Meanwhile, here's a hint.  The equation of the graph is $z=f(x,y)$.  To find the equation of the tangent plane to the graph at a point $(x_0,y_0,z_0)$,Â proceed as follows: we have
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  $$f(x,y)=f(x_0,y_0)+L(\mathbf{h})+R(\mathbf{h}),$$
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  where $L$ is the total derivative of $f$ at $(x_0,y_0)$, $\mathbf{h}$ is the vector $(x-x_0,y-y_0)$, and $R(\mathbf{h})$ is the remainder term.  To find the equation of the tangent plane, replace $f(x,y)$ with the expression $f(x_0,y_0)+L(\mathbf{h})$ (i.e. drop the remainder term) to obtain the equation
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  $$z=f(x_0,y_0)+L(\mathbf{h}).$$
