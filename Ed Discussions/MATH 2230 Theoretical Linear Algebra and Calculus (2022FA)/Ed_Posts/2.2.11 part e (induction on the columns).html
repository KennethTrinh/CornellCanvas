 <paragraph>
  In 2.2.11 part e, when it tells us to use "induction on the columns," does it mean induction on the
  <italic>
   number
  </italic>
  of columns in the matrix, or by which column the pivot we are currently working with is in?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Also, are you requiring us to use induction like the book asks, or can we solve it another way? I believe it would be much more straightforward to just prove this as a corollary to the fact that we showed in part b (it seems redundant to use an induction proof, as we are being asked to prove something for k given k+1, which is essentially an inductive step by itself).

  By "induction on the columns" the author means "induction on $k$", as in part (b).

  If you think you can deduce (e) from (b) without using induction, be my guest.

  If we go the induction route: since we are just being asked to show the formula is true from the (k-1)th step to the kth step, do we just need an inductive step (no base case)?

  You always need a base case in an induction proof.
