 In this example, how do you figure out from the definition of $C$ that it has a self-intersection at the origin?

  I didn’t explain in lecture because you investigated this curve in last week’s homework.
 </p>
 <p>
  Plotting a curve using software (Mac OS Grapher etc) can help you find self-intersection points, cusps, etc.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this example the equation $y^2=x^2(x+1)$ has two solutions $y=\pm x\sqrt{x+1}$, both of which are $C^1$-functions for $x\in(-1,\infty)$.  This tells you that in a little box centered at the origin the curve is the union of two graphs of $C^1$-functions, which intersect at a right angle at the origin: definitely not a manifold.
