  Are they using a different definition of "parameterization" than ours:

  I'm getting that $\varphi_1$ is not a parameterization according to our definition, but I might just be making a mistake.

  I think the question is correct as stated -- Hubbard's definition of parameterization (at least, as in Chapter 3), is verbatim what is written here on the slide. Just to be clear, I'm reading this problem as asking you to show that $\varphi_1$ is a parameterization of $U_1$, the subset of $M_1(m,n)$, not of $M_1(m,n)$, which might be your point of confusion? Not totally sure though.

  Bryan's reading of the problem looks correct to me.
