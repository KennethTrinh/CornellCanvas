 In problem 1, can we use that multiplying a binary number by $2_{10} = 10_2$ is equivalent to shifting the binary point one place to the right (the same way it works in base 10), or is this something we would need to rigorously prove?

  I think this is fine, but the justification is pretty short too, so if you wanted to prove it I don't think it would lengthen your write-up that much.
