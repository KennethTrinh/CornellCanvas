 In this theorem, should we assume $F:\mathbb R^n \to \mathbb R^{n-1}$, $g:\mathbb R^{n-1}\to \mathbb  R$,  and $\vec x$ is just a real number? The definition of Taylor polynomials only seems to apply to functions whose codomain is $\mathbb R$, but the notation $\vec x$ seems to suggest $g$'s codomain can be $\mathbb R^{\ell}$ for $\ell \neq 1$.

  This doesn't seem to be explicitly stated in either the lecture notes or the book, but I think it is intended that $p$ can be a polynomial
  <i>
   vector,
  </i>
  meaning a function all of whose components are polynomial.
