  A set $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ is closed under addition if for all $x, y \in S$, $x + y \in S$.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  As a remark, note that this is also like saying $+ : S \times S \to S$ is well-defined, i.e. applying the addition function to any two elements in $S$ gives something that is also in $S$, but showing this first statement is sufficient.
