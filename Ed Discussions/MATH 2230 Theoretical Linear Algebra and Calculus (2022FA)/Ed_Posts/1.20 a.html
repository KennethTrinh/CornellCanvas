  I'm trying to show that $f(x, y)$ is unique for a given $(x, y)$, i.e. if $(r\cos(\theta), r\sin(\theta)) = (s\cos(\phi), s\sin(\phi))$, then $rh(\theta) = sh(\phi)$.
 </paragraph>

 <paragraph>
  If $(r\cos(\theta), r\sin(\theta)) = (s\cos(\phi), s\sin(\phi))$ (and the $x$ coordinate is nonzero), I can see that $r = \pm s$ and $\theta = \phi +\frac{\pi}{2}n$ for some integer $n$. But it seems like I have to show that $r = s$ and $\theta = \phi + 2\pi n$. How can I do this?

  You may assume $r\ge0$.

  To show that $f$ is continuous at $(x, y) \neq (0, 0)$, I'm trying to use the fact that $f = p\circ g$, where $p:\mathbb{R}^{&gt;0}\times [0, 2\pi) \to \R^2$ defined by

  $$p(r, \theta) = rh(\theta)$$

  and $g:\mathbb R^2\backslash \{(0, 0)\}\to\mathbb{R}^{&gt;0}\times [0, 2\pi)$ that maps $(x, y)$ to the unique $(r, \theta)\in \mathbb{R}^{&gt;0}\times [0, 2\pi)$ such that $x = r\cos\theta$ and $y = r\sin \theta$.

  But I can't figure out how to prove that $g$ is continuous. How can I show this? Or is there a better way to do the problem?

  I don't think $g$ is continuous; look at points whose second coordinate is zero. What about using two functions with smaller domains which together cover $\mathbb{R}^2 \setminus \{(0,0)\}$ and such that they differ by a $C^1$ diffeomorphism on the intersection of their domains?
