 If $f \circ g$ and $g$ are continuous, does that mean that $f$ is necessarily continuous? I was trying to solve 1.20 (a) and I found it easy to prove that $f \circ g$ is continuous (where $g\begin{pmatrix} a\\b \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a\cos b \\ a \sin b \end{pmatrix}$) but I'm struggling to show that $f$ is continuous.

  The answer to your first question is “no”.  It works the other way around: if $f$ and $g$ are continuous, then $f\circ g$ is continuous.
