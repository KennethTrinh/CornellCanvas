  The first part of question 2 says:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  "Draw an equilateral triangle 𝐴1𝐴2𝐴3 and its center of mass 𝐶. What is (the cosine of) the angle between 𝐶 𝐴1 and 𝐶 𝐴2? "
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Can we express the cosine of the angle in terms of any quantities besides the lengths of CA1 and CA2?
