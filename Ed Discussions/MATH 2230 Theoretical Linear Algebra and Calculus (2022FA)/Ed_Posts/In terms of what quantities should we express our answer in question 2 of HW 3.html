 The first part of question 2 says:
</p>
<p>
 "Draw an equilateral triangle 𝐴1𝐴2𝐴3 and its center of mass 𝐶. What is (the cosine of) the angle between 𝐶 𝐴1 and 𝐶 𝐴2? "
</p>
<p>
 Can we express the cosine of the angle in terms of any quantities besides the lengths of CA1 and CA2?

  Do you think the angle depends on the length of $CA_1$ and $CA_2$?
