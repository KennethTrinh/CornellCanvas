<p>
 Are points in which both derivatives are 0 included? Or is it an 'exclusive' or? Thanks!

  Read the question. As per the handout:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  Find all points on the curve $C_a$ at which either $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$ or $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$ is equal to 0 (
  <b>
   but not both
  </b>
  are equal to 0).
 </blockquote>

   Thanks! I hadn't seen the update of the Homework because I had downloaded it before. By the way, is it possible that these changes get announced through Canvas in the future? Had I not asked this question, I would've definitely turned in the old version of Problem 2. Thanks!!
