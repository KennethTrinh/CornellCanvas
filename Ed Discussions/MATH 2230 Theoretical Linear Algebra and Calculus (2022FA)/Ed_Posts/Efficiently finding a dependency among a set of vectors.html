  Let m &lt; n and suppose we are given a set of n vectors in R^m and we want to determine whether any subset of m of them is dependent. Is there a more efficient way of answering this than checking all n choose m subsets individually?

  I don’t think there is.  But your question is a bit unusual.  Usually, given a collection of vectors, one is interested in dependence relations among the whole collection, not subsets of the collection.

  The reason I ask is that exercise 2.5.7 (c), which is one of the practice questions for the exam, asks this with n = 6 and m = 3 and I feel like there has to be a better way of answering this than trying all 6 choose 3 = 20 options. Am I missing something?

  There is some work involved here, but most of the 20 options can be checked quickly.
