  Yes! I think that's fine, as long as you cite them.

  If you're talking about another exercise in the book, it would be good to at least sketch the solution to that problem (this is highly dependent on whether or not that exercise essentially trivializes the problem, in which case you should just do it). If you're talking about something that was mentioned, it would be good to just cite this but also briefly justify it (as I don't know everything that was mentioned in discussion).
