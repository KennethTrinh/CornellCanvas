 Wouldn't X never intersect itself, since it's parametrization is one-to-one?

  You caught the author in a little inconsistency.  The word "parametrization" is used in many different ways.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yes, Definition 3.1.18 demands that parametrizations be one-to-one, but in truth such parametrizations are very rare and are usually known as
  <i>
   embeddings.
  </i>
 </p>
 <p>
  A more common usage of the phrase "parametrization of a subset $X$ of $\mathbf{R}^n$" is a $C^1$-map $\gamma\colon V\to\mathbf{R}^n$, whose domain is an open subset $V$ of $\mathbf{R}^k$ and whose image is equal to $X$.  This is the sense in which the word is used in 3.2.10.
