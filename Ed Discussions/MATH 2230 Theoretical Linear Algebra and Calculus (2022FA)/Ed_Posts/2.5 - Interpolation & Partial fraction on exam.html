 The exam content is up to 2.5, which includes interpolation and partial fractions on the textbook. I think we covered interpolation on recitation but didn't cover partial fractions at all. Will any of those two be part of the exam?

  Interpolation will be, but partial fractions will not. I will clarify the Canvas page.
