 What is the definition of a "curve" in $\mathbb{R}^2$? As a follow-up, do we need to worry about the fact that the curve isn't continuous when $a &lt; 0$, or does this not matter since $f$ is still differentiable at any vector in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and thus any point on $C_a$, regardless of whether $C_a$ is continuous at this point?

  Different areas of mathematics define curves differently, and in fact I think we shall use two different definitions later in this course. For purposes of problem 2, you don't need a precise definition; just think of a curve as a one-dimensional nonlinear space. You don't need to worry about the curve being disconnected in some cases, and are correct as to why that doesn't matter.

   Don't worry too much about the definition of a curve.  For the purpose of this problem it just means the set of points satisfying $y^2=x^3+ax^2$.

   Yes, something funny happens to $C_a$ when $a&lt;0$, but we don't say that $C_a$ is discontinuous, but that it is
