  What is the definition of a "curve" in $\mathbb{R}^2$? As a follow-up, do we need to worry about the fact that the curve isn't continuous when $a &lt; 0$, or does this not matter since $f$ is still differentiable at any vector in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and thus any point on $C_a$, regardless of whether $C_a$ is continuous at this point?

  Don't worry too much about the definition of a curve.  For the purpose of this problem it just means the set of points satisfying $y^2=x^3+ax^2$.

  Yes, something funny happens to $C_a$ when $a&lt;0$, but we don't say that $C_a$ is discontinuous, but that it is

  Different areas of mathematics define curves differently, and in fact I think we shall use two different definitions later in this course. For purposes of problem 2, you don't need a precise definition; just think of a curve as a one-dimensional nonlinear space. You don't need to worry about the curve being disconnected in some cases, and are correct as to why that doesn't matter.
