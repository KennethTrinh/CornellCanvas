  In yesterday's lecture, we wrote $y$ in terms of $x$ to check if functions of different paths converge to the same value. Below is an example we covered in class.

  Once we set $y$ to be some function of $x$, doesn't $\lim_{x \to 0} y = 0$ have to be shown? Otherwise $\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y\end{pmatrix}$ might not converge to  $\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0\end{pmatrix}$.

  Yes, you're right.  But it's OK, because we have $\lim_{x\to0}y(x)=0$ if $y=mx$ or $y=x^2-x$.

  See Example 1.5.24 in the book for a similar but more complicated example.

  Prof. Sjamaar just beat me to it, but yes, you should check that your path actually approaches the point you're taking the limit at. Generally, though, if your path is something simple like a polynomial, you don't have to rigorously justify this on homework.
