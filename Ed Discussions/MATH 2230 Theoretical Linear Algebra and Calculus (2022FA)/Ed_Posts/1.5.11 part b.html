 Do we need to prove that our analogous statement for limits of functions is true, or can we just state it? I notice that the book asks for its proof for problem 1.5.12, which is not in the problem set, so I wasn't sure if it's expected we prove our statement for limits of functions in 1.5.11.

  Yes, prove it.  It’s good practice and will help you iron out mistakes.
