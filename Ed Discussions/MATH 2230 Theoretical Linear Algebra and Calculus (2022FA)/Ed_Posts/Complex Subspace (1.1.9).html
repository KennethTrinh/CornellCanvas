 To be a subspace of the complex plane, must the subset be closed under multiplication by all real scalars or by all complex scalars?

  In this problem we are regarding the set of complex numbers $\mathbf{C}$ as the real vector space $\mathbf{R}^2$, and when we say "subspace" we mean "real subspace", i.e. nonempty, closed under addition and under
  <i>
   real
  </i>
  scalar multiplication.
