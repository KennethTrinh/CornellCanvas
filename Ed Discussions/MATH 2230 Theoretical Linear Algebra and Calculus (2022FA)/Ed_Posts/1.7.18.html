  The book says that $|\nabla f(a)|$ is the rate at which $f$ increases at $a$ in the direction of $\nabla f(a)$. But shouldn't the rate at which $f$ increases at $a$ in the direction of a vector $v$ be the directional derivative of $f$ in direction $v$ evaluated at $a$? But then for $v = \nabla f(a)$, this is
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  $$[Df(a)]\nabla f(a) = \nabla f(a) \cdot \nabla f(a) = |\nabla f(a)|^2$$

  What am I doing wrong here?

  Nothing is wrong with what you've done here computationally, but note that in Problem 1.7.18 the vector $\mathbf{\vec{v}}$ is a

   unit vector

  . Is $\nabla f(\mathbf{a})$ a unit vector in general?
