 1.4.8 asks us to "compute the determinants of the matrices" - does that mean I can just write the answer or do I have to show working?
</p>
<p>
 1.4.11 asks "which of the following statements are true" - same question here: can I just identify the true statements or do I have to give an explanation?
</p>

  1.4.8 -- to be safe, you should demonstrate some understanding of how the determinant is computed. If your computation is incorrect, I wouldn't be able to award as much credit to you as compared to if you showed work. This is generally true for all computational problems, and just good practice -- later on in this course and in 2240, the computations will increase in complexity quite a bit and I can award various amounts of partial credit even for computations with intermediate errors.

  1.4.11 should almost certainly require a brief explanation if they're true, and a counterexample if they're not.
