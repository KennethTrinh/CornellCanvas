 Can we use as a fact that a 3Ã—3 matrix is invertible if and only if its determinant is not 0?

  Also, is it possible that in problem 3 the neighborhood is of f(r0) rather than of r0?

  You can, but we have better ways of checking that a matrix is invertible.
 </p>
 <p>
  You are supposed to look for points $\mathbf{r}_0$ which have a neighborhood $U$ such that $f(U)$ is open and the restriction of $f$ to $U$ is one-to-one.
