  No; your solution should work for V = R^n and x in V. You can use a special case if necessary.

  Let's suppose R^n is R^2 in this case, and V is also R^2. With this framing of the question, that means that there is that there is some singular vector in R^2 that is orthogonal to all vectors in V? As far as I know, that shouldn't be possible?

  Yes, there is a singlular vector in R^2 which is orthogonal to all vectors in R^2. What value does "singular" suggest?
