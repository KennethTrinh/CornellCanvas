  The following is the precondition  for the constructor in group c:

 <snippet language="java" line-numbers="true" runnable="true">
  <snippet-file id="code">
   /** Constructor: an elephant with nickname n, gender g, birth year y, birth month m, mother ma, and father pa.
Precondition: n has at least 1 character, y &gt;= 2000, g is 'F' for female or 'M' for male, m is in 1..12, ma is a female, and pa is a male */
  </snippet-file>

 <paragraph>
  Let's say that we have an elephant with just a mother and no father.  This would throw an assertion error as father cannot be null as father must be a male.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Are we allowed to have these edge cases where there is only one parent?  Or is there a way to assert that the father elephant is a male; and if not, we can assert it as null.

  Thanks in advance.
