 The prompt says to notify the user, and I am confused what that means. Does the program want a pop-up? Or is adjusting the score as part of TODO 9 sufficient?

  The prompt says to "notify observers" - observers of a property are often objects in memory, not human users.  From reading the given code at the start of the assignment, you should know of a tool that's already capable of notifying the relevant observers.
