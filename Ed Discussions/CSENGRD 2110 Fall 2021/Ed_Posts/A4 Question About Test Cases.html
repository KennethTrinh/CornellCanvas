 Hello, guys! I just had a quick question about the number of test cases that we should have for Assignment 4. On the guide, it says we should test each of the methods that we write separately but that we should test toStringR and prepend together. However, this would mean we only have 4 test cases. On top of that, at the bottom, it says we should add a testConstructor() as well, meaning we should now have 5 testing methods. I suppose my question is: how many testing methods should we have? If we only test the methods that we write and test toStringR and prepend together, we would have 4. However, if we add in testConstructor, that would be 5. I am just a little confused. Any help you could give would be much appreciated. Thank you!
</p>

  You are being haphazard about your wording.
 </p>
 <p>
  A test case is one call of a method, say, a test of its result.
 </p>
 <p>
  Therefore, in testing toStringR and prepend together in one testing procedure you will have several test cases.
 </p>
 <p>
  The testing of the constructor is already given to you, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  Test toStringR and prepend together, in one testing procedure, with @Test before it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, write a separate testing procedure for each of the other methods you have to implement.

   First off, apologies about the wording. I will be more careful in the future.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, I'm sorry, I do not quite get what you mean when you say the "testing of the constructor is already given to you, right?" Do you mean that since the constructor is written for us, it has already been tested? Or, do you mean that the way to test the constructor is given to us in the handout for A4, meaning we should include it in our testing file? I am just a little confused because we had to create our own DListTest (it was not given to us on the assignment page).
