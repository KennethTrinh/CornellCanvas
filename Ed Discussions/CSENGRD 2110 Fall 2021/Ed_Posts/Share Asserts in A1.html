 For A1, I called the first constructor in the second one. Do I need to further write the assertions shared with the first one again in this second constructor (e.g. y&gt;=2000)?

  Look at item 5 in pinned note Assignment 1.

  Please, always look there before asking a question about A1 and save us all time.
