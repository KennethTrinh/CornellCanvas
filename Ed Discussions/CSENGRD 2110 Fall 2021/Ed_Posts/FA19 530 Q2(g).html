 Hi!

 I have a question about a practice prelim (2019, 5:30 PM).  For 2g), I am confused on why "I2 k2 = i1" does not compile while "I2 k = b" does. Is it because i1 is declared as a variable of type interface and interface can't be actual objects?
</p>
<p>
 Thank you!

  It sounds like for i1 = b, it is pointing to the same memory location as b. In that case, wouldnt there be a partition in b (and thus in i1) for both I1 and I2 thus allowing it to compile?
 </p>
 <p>
  I was looking at #561 and there, C1 h = (C1)(A) b; is valid for this exact reason because for C1 h = (C1)(A) b; to be valid, (A) b would have to have a partition for C1, which A by itself does not have.

   I2 k = b compiles because class B implements I2.
  </p>
  <p>
   I2 K2 = i1 does not compile because i1 is declared to reference Interface 1 while this assignment is trying to make K refer to interface 2.

    <p>
     is I1 i1 = b; pointing i1 to the same memory location as b or is it just copying the values of b?

      I think #595 will help explain it to you.
