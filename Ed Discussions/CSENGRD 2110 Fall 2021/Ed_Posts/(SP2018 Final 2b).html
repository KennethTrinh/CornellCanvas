  why does M.mystery(222) return true when mystery(int i) returns true if the digits of i are in ascending order? Does the repeating the same value mean it is still in ascending order?

  Thank you in advance!

  The answer is "yes" because the question does not disallow the repetition of repeated digits.

  The word "ascending" is often meant to mean that there can be duplicates. Thus, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5 could be considered an ascending sequence. But it IS ambiguous; for some, that sequence is not ascending.

  A better word to use in this case is non-descending, non-decreasing. The problem is that Merriam-Webster online does not define "non-descending. It has to be written as "non descending".

  what about the case for 1331. Does it allow a combination of the two? Ascending and descending? Or should I be thinking "aaa" is still a palindrome
