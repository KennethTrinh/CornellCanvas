<p>
 why does M.mystery(222) return true when mystery(int i) returns true if the digits of i are in ascending order? Does the repeating the same value mean it is still in ascending order?
</p>
<p>
 Thank you in advance!

  The word "ascending" is often meant to mean that there can be duplicates. Thus, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5 could be considered an ascending sequence. But it IS ambiguous; for some, that sequence is not ascending.
 </p>
 <p>
  A better word to use in this case is non-descending, non-decreasing. The problem is that Merriam-Webster online does not define "non-descending. It has to be written as "non descending".

   what about the case for 1331. Does it allow a combination of the two? Ascending and descending? Or should I be thinking "aaa" is still a palindrome

   The answer is "yes" because the question does not disallow the repetition of repeated digits.
