 I get the following error:
</p>
<p>
 "Warning: the fonts "Times" and "Times" are not available for the Java logical font "Serif", which may have unexpected appearance or behavior. Re-enable the "Times" font to remove this warning."
</p>
<p>
 Is this an issue?
</p>

  This should not be a major issue for this assignment.  It is a bit surprising, however.  I expect those fonts to always be present on a Mac, and I would not expect Java to bother looking form them on any other platform.

   I had the same problem. I read online that the issue is because of the new Mac update. If you download the Times font the error should go away.

   Here's the link I used to fix the problem
