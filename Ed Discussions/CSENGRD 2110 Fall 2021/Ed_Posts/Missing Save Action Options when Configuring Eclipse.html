  I am attempting to configure the Eclipse Save Settings as shown on this page:

  It says that there should be "9 options in the horizontal bar" but I am only presented with 6. Specifically, there is no "Java Feature" tab as shown in the image below.

  Also, in the "Unnecessary Code" tab there is no option to check off "Boolean Value Rather than Comparison" as shown below:

  I do see some boxes on the above tab that seem like they may be related to the configuration settings I am missing but I am unsure if they are exactly what I am supposed to be selecting.

  I believe that you are using an older version of Eclipse, which had only 6 and not 9 panes. Did you download and install the newest --the one mentioned on our Canvas website?

  If you're referring to the M1 Macs, I have one too.  You have to first install Rosetta 2 so the ARM chip can essentially emulate the Intel version of Eclipse (there's no ARM version yet). Then when I installed Eclipse, I got an error, but then I tried again and it worked.

  In older versions of Eclipse, the two settings under "Java Feature" can be found under "Unnecessary Code" instead.  And the "Boolean value rather than comparison" option may not exist.  This is okay - your code will still work, but you may get feedback from graders if your Boolean expressions are not as simple as they could be.
