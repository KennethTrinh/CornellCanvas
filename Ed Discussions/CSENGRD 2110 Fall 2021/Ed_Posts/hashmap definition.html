  for my hashmap definintion, I currently state that the values of the map are Items containing ...
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  However, since Item is a private class am I allowed to say this in the public method? or should I just state what item contains without explicitly mentioning Item. Thanks.

  I think you have the wrong definition.  What kind of nodes are in the hash map?  That is your definition.

  Yeah also include that.  Make sure to define what kind of nodes (i.e. settled/frontier nodes, or both) are in the hashmap.

  What attributes does Item have? What information do they contain about the nodes?

  thanks! I have the info about what is in Item, I just don't know if I can explicitly reference the type "Item" since it is a private inner class

  You had an inner class in the assignment on linked list,s, and there we TOLD you to reference the fields of the inner class directly.
