  Should we know how to do this? The study guide says the merge algorithm of mergeSort won't be included because it is too complicated, but I wanted to clarify, incase I misunderstood.

  Another question, what are the parameters int h, j, and k? How are we supposed to know how its used in merge?

  Agreed. Also looking at the specification helps, since it tells you what these variables mean and what the merge() algorithm is doing. But also look in JavaHyperText for merge and mergeSort.

  I see it now. So if this type of question was on the exam, we would have to memorize both? I had only focused on understanding how merge sort worked.

  Not exactly how the merge algorithm works, but what it does. You should understand that if I give merge() some arguments, assuming I follow the precondition, what will I get out? (In short, you pass in two adjacent sorted partitions of an array, and you get out a combined sorted partition). Don't worry about how it happens, just
  <bold>
   what
  </bold>
  <bold>
   happens
  </bold>
  .

  for this question is it useful to look back at the lecture notes to see how it is used

  This question has you write the
  <bold>
   MergeSort
  </bold>
  algorithm. You're given the merge algorithm already with the specification, merge(). You just need to use it correctly in your solution.
