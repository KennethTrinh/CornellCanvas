  Please write down execution of this yourself, explaining what is happening.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I'll start you off:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1. i= 0;   is executed.             i is 0
  <break>
  </break>
  2. i &lt; 5 is evaluated. It is true.
  <break>
  </break>
  3. Repetend is executed.     i is 1
  <break>
  </break>
  4.1 is added to i because of the header. i is 2.
 </paragraph>

  2)the loop starts again, 2&lt;5 is true,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  then 2+1 = 3
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1 is added again because of the header, this i is 4.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  3)the loop starts again, 4&lt;5 is true,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  then 4+1 = 5
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1 is added again because of the header, this i is 6
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  4)6&lt;5 is evaluated, which is false, and the loop stops.
 </paragraph>
