  Think about this in terms of the bottom-up rule: if I invoke one of the interface's methods on the class, will an implementation of that method be found using the rule?  If so, then nothing else needs to be done.

  Great, thank you! So just to confirm, the class would not need to implement interfaces methods because its superclass did.
