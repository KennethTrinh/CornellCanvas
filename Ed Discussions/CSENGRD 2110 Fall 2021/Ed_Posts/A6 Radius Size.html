 This may be a silly question, but when calling on the radius of the target in methods paintDot() an checkHit() for width and height of graphic methods should we be using radius*2, or is it fine if we just use radius?

  There is a big difference between
  <code>
   radius
  </code>
  and
  <code>
   radius*2
  </code>
  - a whole factor of 2!  The latter of course corresponds to a circle's diameter.  You need to choose the right quantity based on the specifications and on the API documentation for the functions involved.  The radius of the circle as drawn on the screen must be equal to its
  <code>
   radius
  </code>
  property in pixels (ignoring the effects of screen magnification).

   You have to code a mathematical equality for checkHit() to make sure your cursor is at most one radius from the center of the target on both the x and y axis.  I suggest writing this equality on paper and then implementing it on eclipse.
