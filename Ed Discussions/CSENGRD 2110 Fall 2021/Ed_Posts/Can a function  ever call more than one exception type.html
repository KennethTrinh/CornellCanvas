  For example, can a function cause an ArithmeticException in it's try-block and then in executing the catch block, cause a NullpointerException?

  I thought this wouldn't be logical since once the try-block terminates and an exception is caught, that's it. And then if another exception is to be made, it would be thrown out of the function since it's not in any try-block
