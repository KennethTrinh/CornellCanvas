 You know what a palindrome is: something that reads the same backward and forward.
</p>
<p>
 The Date 2 December 2021 is a palindrome. See below.
</p>
<p>
 But it is also an ambigram; see the definition below. Turn the date upside down and it reads the same.

 From somewhere on the web: An ambigram is a calligraphic design that has several interpretations as written. The term was coined by Douglas Hofstadter in 1983. Most often, ambigrams appear as visually symmetrical words. When flipped, they remain unchanged, or they mutate to reveal another meaning. "Half-turn" ambigrams undergo a point reflection and can be read upside down, mirror ambigrams have an axial symmetry and can be read through a reflective surface, and many other types of ambigrams exist.
