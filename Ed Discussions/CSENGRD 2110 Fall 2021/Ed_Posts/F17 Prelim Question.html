 For Question (4), may I ask why this results in a run-time error? I have read through previous threads (i.e. #543) regarding this concept, but can't really understand why (A3) would be considered the static type here instead of A1 at compile time.
</p>
<p>
 By the same reasoning, why do parts (3-5) in the question below not result in runtime issues, if C1 is an abstract class?

  Question 4 throws a Class Cast Exception which is a run-time error.  This is because A1 is not an instance of A3.  This is why question 5 results in no run-time error, A3 is an instance of A1.

   for (4), I think it's a runtime error because the compiler reads the call as a cast so it accepts it. However when it's actually run, it realizes it's an upward cast and thrown an error.

   Here's a stackoverflow definition that should help:
