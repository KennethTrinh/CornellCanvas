  In earlier Ed posts, it's been mentioned that an announcement would be made on Sunday/Monday regarding the potential of online finals due to the COVID situation; have you all seen any update on this or official announcement? I haven't seen anything on Canvas, and wanted to check in case that info was available and I hadn't found where yet. Thanks!

  There is no real update at this point. Emails are going to those who are in special rooms or because of being quarantined are taking the prelim online.

  But most others we will see in spacious Barton Hall tomorrow. Bring your Cornell id cards --and wear a mask and we should all be safe.
