  Slide 16 shows how there are (c+1) + k +1 basic steps in evaluating s = s + 'c'
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  but then slide 17 says there are only (c+1) + k basic steps.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I am wondering where the discrepancy comes from?

  A mistake, which is of no real consequence. Sorry about that.

  Below is what slide 16 says. We should have written (C+2) + k basic steps on slide 17.

 <paragraph>
  You can make the rest of the changes on line 17 and see that it doesn't make two much difference.
