 Slide 16 shows how there are (c+1) + k +1 basic steps in evaluating s = s + 'c'
</p>
<p>
 but then slide 17 says there are only (c+1) + k basic steps.
</p>
<p>
 I am wondering where the discrepancy comes from?

  A mistake, which is of no real consequence. Sorry about that.

  Below is what slide 16 says. We should have written (C+2) + k basic steps on slide 17.
 </p>
 <p>
  You can make the rest of the changes on line 17 and see that it doesn't make two much difference.

 <p>
  =======================
 </p>
 <p>
  1.Create new String object, say C basic steps.
 </p>
 <p>
  2.Copy k chars from object s to the new object: k basic steps
 </p>
 <p>
  3.Place char ‘c’ into the new object: 1 basic step.
 </p>
 <p>
  4.Store pointer to new object into s: 1 basic step.
 </p>
 <p>
  Total of (C+1) + k + 1 basic steps.
