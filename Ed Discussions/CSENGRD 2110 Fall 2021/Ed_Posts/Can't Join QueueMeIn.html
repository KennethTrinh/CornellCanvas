 The above is what I see when I try to join the queue. When I try to click on the textbox, the cursor doesn't show up and I can't write anything. Clicking on it seems to do nothing.  I also don't have any categories to pick from, so I can't select tags or input a zoom link either. I tried multiple devices, which all had the same issue, and a friend in the class was also having the same problem when they tested it out.
