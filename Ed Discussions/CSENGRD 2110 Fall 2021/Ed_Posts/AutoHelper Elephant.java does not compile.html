  Hello,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  After submitting A1, I got feedback from Autohelper saying that the tests ran perfectly but Elephant.java would not compile. I was following along with the A1 #Autohelper post to figure out potential issues with why it will not compile. The files are in an a1 package. The class name, methods, and parameters are all as they should be named. I changed the source code to encode to UTF-8. There are no JUnit functions in my Elephant class. And after looking at a similar posting here, I checked my tests and asserts and they seem fine to me. I'm stumped as to what the issue is. It also seems that after 4 uploads, I no longer receive feedback, so I have no idea if my final submission will compile. Will I lose points if my Elephant.java file does not compile on Autohelper?

  Thank you!

  Did you make sure that there are no strange

  or similar characters? That was my problem after changing source code to UTF-8.
