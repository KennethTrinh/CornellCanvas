 I was a bit confused on the response to dicussion post
 <a href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/7377/discussion/718363">
  #727
 </a>
</p>
<p>
 From what I am understanding from the javadoc comment we are supposed to create a new Tree with person = c, then add this new Tree as a child to the node that has person = d. Am I understanding this correctly?
</p>
<p>
 Also as a follow up, is it possible to access the children of node(p) like this:
</p>
<p>
 node(p).children.add( [some new Tree])
</p>
<p>
 Thank you!
</p>

  Here is the spec, with all the stuff about illegal arguments deleted:
 </p>
 <p>
  /** Give p a new child, a node with Person c. &lt;br&gt;
  <break>
  </break>
  * Return the newly created node.
  <break>
  </break>
  public H1N1Tree insert(Person p, Person c)
  <break>
  </break>
 </p>
 <p>
  So, yes, you are supposed to create a new H1N1Tree object with Person c in field person.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, add this object to field children of the node whose Person is p.
