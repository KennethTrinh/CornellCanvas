 (b) 3 points Let h have type HashSet〈E〉 and ll have LinkedList〈E〉. What are the worst-case time complexities of h.add(e), ll.add(e), and ll.add(k, e) for some object e, assuming there are n elements in the set or list?
</p>
<p>
 Answer: O(n), O(1), O(k).
</p>
<p>
 I was confused as to why adding to a HashSet would have a worst-case time complexity of O(n) and adding to index k at linked list would have a worst-cast time complexity of O(k).
