 I am confused when the spec says "If the last target for the current game has not yet been shown, respawn the target" I may not be thinking about ir right, but shouldn't a target be respawned only
 <i>
  after
 </i>
 the last target has been
 <i>
  shown
 </i>
 and the timer delay has passed?

  By "re-spawn the target", it means draw another target at a different random place.
 </p>
 <p>
  It does NOT mean "start a new game".

 <p>
  Don't be concerned with the timer. This method will be called only at the right time.
