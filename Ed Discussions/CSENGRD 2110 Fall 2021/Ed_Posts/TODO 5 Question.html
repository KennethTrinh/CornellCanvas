  I am confused when the spec says "If the last target for the current game has not yet been shown, respawn the target" I may not be thinking about ir right, but shouldn't a target be respawned only
  <italic>
   after
  </italic>
  the last target has been
  <italic>
   shown
  </italic>
  and the timer delay has passed?

  By "re-spawn the target", it means draw another target at a different random place.

  It does NOT mean "start a new game".

  Don't be concerned with the timer. This method will be called only at the right time.
