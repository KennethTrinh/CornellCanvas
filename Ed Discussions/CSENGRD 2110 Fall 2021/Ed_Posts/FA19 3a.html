 I'm still having a bit of trouble with when to use equals or ==. I understand that equals() is for when they're not in the same memory space, and is used on classes, while == is used on primitives.
</p>
<p>
 1) Why is it that when comparing the getClass(), == is used, even though classes are being compared?
</p>
<p>
 2) And for equals(color), is this because the field being compared belongs to a class and not a primitive type?

<p>
 and would the string here be the wrapper class String, thus being the reason why == is not used to compare what I thought was two strings, or is it due to the strings being fields for classes? Thank you!!

  1. You can take a look at the API for getClass():
 </p>
 <pre>https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Object.html#getClass()
</pre>
 <p>
  Basically is that getClass() will return you the class itself. Similarly, you will get
  <code>
   true
  </code>
  for
  <code>
   "a".getClass() == "b".getClass()
  </code>
  because they are both instances of String Class(String is not a primitive type)
 </p>
 <p>
  2. Yes. You want to use the equals method in class Color to make sure they are the same by the definitions in that Color class.
 </p>
 <p>
  And String is not a primitive type in Java, it is a class, and there's no wrapper class for that.
