 Title: The new-expression cannot be used on interfaces. But we're able to assign variables to an interface? Do I have that correct

 I don't understand why we can assign variables to an interface but not declare a variable as an interface

  Suppose we have this:
 </p>
 <p>
  interface I1 {...}
  <break>
  </break>
  class C implements I1{}
 </p>
 <p>
  and somewhere we write
 </p>
 <p>
  I1 b= new C{...};
 </p>
 <p>
  The object created looks as shown below. It has three partitions, for superset class Object, class C, and interface I1. In evaluating the new-expression   new C{...} this object is created and a pointer to it is used as the value of the new-expression. Assignment to variable b requires an upward cast to I1, which is inserted automatically since it is an upward cast. Then the pointer to the object is stored in b.
 </p>
 <p>
  This means that b points at the whole object. However, since b's (static) type is I1, by the Compile-time reference rule, the only method calls like  b.m(...) that can be compiled are ones in which m is declared in interface I1 or in class Object.
 </p>
 <pre>       Object
          |   I1
          |  /
          | /
          C
</pre>
