 Hi, for A1, how would I check the type of say y and m in the constructor to make sure they are ints and not a double or some other type is given? And would I need to check the other parameters that they are also the correct type? I tried using instanceof (found on javahypertext) but it created errors for me when trying to check anything other than Strings. Thanks.
</p>

  You do not need checks on the type.

  The program will not compile and cannot be executed if the type is int and a call has a double argument. That's the nice thing bout strong typing at compile time.

  You do NOT have to check that parameters have the right type.
