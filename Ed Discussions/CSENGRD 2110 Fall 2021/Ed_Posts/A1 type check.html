  Hi, for A1, how would I check the type of say y and m in the constructor to make sure they are ints and not a double or some other type is given? And would I need to check the other parameters that they are also the correct type? I tried using instanceof (found on javahypertext) but it created errors for me when trying to check anything other than Strings. Thanks.

  You do not need checks on the type.

  The program will not compile and cannot be executed if the type is int and a call has a double argument. That's the nice thing bout strong typing at compile time.

  You do NOT have to check that parameters have the right type.
