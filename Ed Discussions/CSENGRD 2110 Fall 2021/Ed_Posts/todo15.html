 do we have to get the name of the file that the score is trying to be saved in? If so, how do you get the name of that file?

  When you navigate to a directory where the file is, or where you want the file, two cases may occur:
 </p>
 <p>
  1. That file has not been created yet. Well, type the name of the file yourself.
 </p>
 <p>
  2. That file WAS created earlier. Then the name of the file will appear in the directory, greyed out. Click that file name and it will be copied into the place where the file name goes.
