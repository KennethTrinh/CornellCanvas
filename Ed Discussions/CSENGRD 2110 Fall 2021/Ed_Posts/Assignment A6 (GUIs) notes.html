 Between Lecture 17 and the due date, you have 11 days to work on this assignment.  There are 15 TODOs to complete, several of which require teaching yourself new skills from tutorial and API pages, so you should not attempt to complete this project at the last minute.  Here is one way to spread out the work:
</p>
<list style="bullet">
 <li>
  <p>
   Day 1: Download and study the demo code from Lecture 17.  Make a few tweaks and observe their effects when you run the demos.  Make a list of which inherited methods are used or overridden in these demos.
   <break>
   </break>
   Download and read the given code for A6, looking for similarities with the slides and demos.  Make a list of the fields and methods in
   <code>
    GameComponent
   </code>
   and
   <code>
    Target
   </code>
   so you know what tools are at your disposal.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Day 2: As a warmup, complete TODOs 1-2 based on Lecture 16.  Complete TODOs 3-4 based on Lecture 17.  Test as you go, as suggested by the handout.
   <break>
   </break>
   Take a break, then complete TODOs 5-8 (these involve the most complicated logic of all the tasks).  Do as much as you can on your own; if you get stuck, write down specific questions.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Day 3: Seek assistance if you could not complete TODOs 5-8 the previous day.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Day 4: Complete TODOs 9-11.  You should be comfortable searching Javadoc API pages by this point.
   <break>
   </break>
   Read the Swing Tutorial page on sliders, then complete TODO 12.  If you have questions, ask them in the context of the Swing Tutorial page.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Day 5: Read the Swing Tutorial pages on layout managers and borders.  Make a sketch of the slider panel described in TODO 13 and use it to identify which layout manager to use and where the border should go.  Implement TODO 13.
   <break>
   </break>
   Read the Swing Tutorial pages on menus and complete TODO 14.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Day 6: Read the Swing Tutorial pages on file choosers and dialogs.  Practice using them in a demo application, and be prepared to show your demos to a consultant.  Then complete TODO 15.

   When testing TODO 5, the game should end after
   <b>
    15 seconds
   </b>
   , not 10 (as stated in the handout).  Just before publishing the assignment, there was a request to slow down the default game speed to make testing TODO 8 easier, and this change wasn't reflected in the handout.

   There is no AutoHelper for A6.  In most cases, if you can play the game on your computer, it should work for us as well.  The usual rules apply: only import classes that are part of the Java standard library, and use UTF-8 encoding for your source code if you use non-ASCII characters in strings or comments.  Nothing should be printed to the console in your final submission.
  </p>

  <p>
   In TODO 9, there is a minor typo in the type of listener to add; it should say "PropertyChangeListener" (no extra 'r' in "Property").
