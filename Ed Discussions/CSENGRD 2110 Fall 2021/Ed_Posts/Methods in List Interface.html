 If these methods have empty bodies, why are they not abstract methods? What makes this particular case different from a case in which we would have to use abstract methods?

  Remember interfaces donâ€™t need methods to be declared explicitly as abstract. All methods in an interface are already public and abstract.

   Thanks! Does this mean that if I were to declare them public and abstract I would be incorrect? Or would it just be redundant?

    You could still declare them public and abstract, but it's redundant.
