 Will not including your netID and changing the timeStamp to something other than -1 cause all the tests to fail in CMS?

 I was able to run my code against the test cases without errors, but it's tough to see where the problem could be.

  Answer to first question: no.

  Is this a problem with the auto-helper? What does it say?

   I'll share a text file. Granted I agreed with the issues about protectLittleOnes. The others I can't see the problem.

    Ignore this Dr. Gries. Something fixed itself, and my weekend was saved. The Great Big Red Bear missed me today
