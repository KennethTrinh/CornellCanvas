  Prelim 2 had a question with the spec and method header given below (note: this was on one of the prelims; the other prelim had a similar question, but slightly different; what we say here applies to both):
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  /** Return true if the tree rooted at this node is a binary search tree (BST)
  <break>
  </break>
  and all its values are in the range h..k. */
  <break>
  </break>
  public boolean isBST(int h, int k)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  PART of several incorrect solutions were similar to the following:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  if ( left.val &gt;= val  || val &gt;= rite.val  ) return false;
  <break>
  </break>
  return left.isBST(h, k)  &amp;&amp;  rite.isBST(h, k)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  This attempt to test whether the values satisfy the BST properties is fundamentally flawed. It does not work. To see this, look at the 4-node tree shown below.  It is not a BST because not every value in the left subtree is smaller than 5. Yet, the incorrect solution, with h = 0 and k = 10, would say it is a BST.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Instead, this PART of the solution has to be written to test that every value in the left subtree is &lt; val and every value in the right subtree is &gt; val. Since the values are ints, we write this PART as follows.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  return left.isBST(h, val-1)  &amp;&amp;  rite.isBST(val+1, k)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  This mistake turned  to be a 4-point deduction, meted out consistently to all who made this mistake.
