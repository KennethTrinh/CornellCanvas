 Hello everyone! I just have a quick question about Question 2f in Fall 2019's 5:30 prelim 1 (sorry if this has been asked before, but I could not find it). In this question, we have to make test cases for isReverse(String b, String c), where the precondition is that "b and c cannot be null." However, in the answer key for this exam, there are two test cases that test if b is null and if c is null (this throws an exception). In previous coding classes, we were always told that test cases should
 <b>
  never
 </b>
 violate the precondition. Are there different rules to testing in this class? Can our test cases violate the precondition of the method? Or, do these test cases actually not violate the precondition in some way? I hope this makes sense. Thank you in advance for the help!
</p>

    I think this question intended that this precondition applies when
    <i>
     both
    </i>
    b and c are null. We have tried to make sure all the questions are clearer than this on this semester's exam.

     To clarify - in this class we shouldn't violate the precondition when writing test cases, correct? This question was just confusing?
