 I optimized scram phase to the point of collecting 20k coins and like 20k or 22k points on the seed that David Gries played in his Panopto Recording.  Would this be an optimal score to get above 85%?  And if so, how high?  Thanks.

  I'm sorry, we can't give out information like that.

  Take a look at the scores one sees in google doc found in the Assignment A8 Ed Discussions note. Perhaps you can estimate from those scores how well one can do.
