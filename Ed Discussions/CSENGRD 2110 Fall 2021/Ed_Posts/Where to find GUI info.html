 Since javahypertext doesn't include any information about GUIs yet, is there any site you guys could recommend if we are looking for another explanation about them and their concepts?

  The lectures and A6 handout both recommend Oracle's own
  <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/index.html">
   Swing Tutorial
  </a>
  .
