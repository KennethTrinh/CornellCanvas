<p>
 Also, are assert statements only put in constructor bodies? Or can they be used in the same place as variable declarations as well?
</p>
<p>
 What's the point of putting assert statements inside a constructor body if they can just be used right next to the variable declaration?
</p>

  Assert statements are executable code - they can go in constructor and method bodies, but not with field declarations.  Unlike in some languages, they do not enforce constraints on a field whenever that field is changed; they only perform their check when they are executed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Additionally, assert statements should not be relied upon for validating user input.  Remember - they are completely disabled by default, so
  <b>
   a function's behavior must not rely on them
  </b>
  (we violate this principle in assignment A1 for pedagogical reasons, but after that, assert statements take on a much more narrow role).
 </p>
 <p>
  Assert statements are most helpful for finding logic errors in the implementation of a class or library - an implementer uses them to confirm that things they think should always be true really are.  Since a precondition is something that an implementer assumes to be true, assert statements are a great fit for verifying preconditions during development.

    You're welcome!  I noticed that this question is marked "private", but I expect other students are wondering the same thing and would benefit from this discussion.  I encourage you to make your posts public as long as they don't contain assignment code (you can still make your name anonymous if you like).
