 I was confused about this part of TODO 5 because I don't know how to check if the last target for the current game has been shown. Right now I believe I should be doing something with the targetCount variable in my if statement, but I can't quite figure it out.

  Remember that "last" does not mean the previous element, use the fact that you know how many targets
  <i>
   should
  </i>
  be shown along with a counter that tells us how many
  <i>
   have
  </i>
  been shown.
