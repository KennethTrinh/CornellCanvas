  On a past prelim the question and answer are as follows:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  It is possible for a method to be both overridden and overloaded. true
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Doesn't a method need to have the same signature to be overridden and a different signature to be overloaded?

  Method toString() is declared in the superest class of them all, Object.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Certainly, a class can override toString(), you have seen that done many times.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  However, a class could also declare a method with this header:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  public String toString(String v)  { ... }
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  That would overload the name toString
