 On a past prelim the question and answer are as follows:
</p>
<p>
 It is possible for a method to be both overridden and overloaded. true
</p>
<p>
 Doesn't a method need to have the same signature to be overridden and a different signature to be overloaded?
</p>

  Method toString() is declared in the superest class of them all, Object.
 </p>
 <p>
  Certainly, a class can override toString(), you have seen that done many times.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, a class could also declare a method with this header:
 </p>
 <p>
  public String toString(String v)  { ... }
 </p>
 <p>
  That would overload the name toString
