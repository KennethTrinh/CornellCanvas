  On the seed, 2805343804353418701, once the ring is found, essentially the entire map is filled with wall tiles, it is very different from the original layout during the seek phase. Is this something we caused, or is it an error? There are also no coins.

  Definitely not something you caused, I got the same result.

  My code seems to be working on every random seed it has encountered so far except for this one.

  Oh that's weird I don't get the same coin map when I run that seed, I get this one:

  Interesting seed: 2805343804353418701. Never saw it before.

  Your scram should work on it.
  <break>
  </break>
  Try your initial attempt at scram, the one which just calculates the shortest path to the exit and traverses it. Does it work on that? Mine does.

  Yes, ours works as well, it just came as a surprise and we wanted to make sure there wasn't a issue with our code. Thank you!
