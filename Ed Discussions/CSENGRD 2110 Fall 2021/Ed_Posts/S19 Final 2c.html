 Hi!

 I was a little confused about the explanation for worrying about concurrency with hash sets. If we are adding the same element at the same time, why would this be a problem? Is it because if both threads think the element they are adding is not added, then both add the element, and it causes a duplicate?

 Thank you very much!
