 For Recitation 1 problem 5 I am attempting to use the method indexOf. The error I am receiving is saying the method is undefined. I have an import statement at the top which is import javax.swing.*;
</p>
<p>
 I also saw in the Recitation slides that we are also supposed to have a package statement on line 1. the statement is supposed to be package pack1;
</p>
<p>
 however, we were instructed not to name the package we created, so I'm not sure how to call the package in order to access the indexOf() method.
</p>

  indexOf is a method in class String. You don't need to import anything for it because String is in package java.lang. You won't need to import javax.swing in this class. How are you calling indexOf? Are you using the dot notation with the string variable?
