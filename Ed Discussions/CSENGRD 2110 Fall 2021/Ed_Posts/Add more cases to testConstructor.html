 We're given this in the instructions. I was wondering if we have to add more test cases to it.
</p>
<p>
 Since we didn't implement the constructor, and the instructions tell us to only test the 5 methods we implement, I'm assuming we don't have to add more test cases to testConstructor?
</p>
<p>
 Just wanted to make sure.

  What other test case would you possibly add?
 </p>
 <p>
  Doesn't that one test case suffice?
