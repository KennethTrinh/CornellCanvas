  We're given this in the instructions. I was wondering if we have to add more test cases to it.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Since we didn't implement the constructor, and the instructions tell us to only test the 5 methods we implement, I'm assuming we don't have to add more test cases to testConstructor?

  Just wanted to make sure.
