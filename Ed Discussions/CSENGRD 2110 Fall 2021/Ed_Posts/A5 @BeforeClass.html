 In our a5 boilerplate code that we use I see that some methods are using @BeforeClass annotation for testing. However it is giving me an error, saying that that annotation does not exist in JUnit 5. According to JUnit 5 documentation we should be using @BeforeAll which is "analogous to JUnit 4â€™s
 <code>
  @BeforeClass
 </code>
 ". When I changed that annotation to @BeforeClass my boilerplate code finally started to work.
