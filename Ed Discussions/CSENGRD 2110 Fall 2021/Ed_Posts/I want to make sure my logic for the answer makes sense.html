 Is it true that Java evaluates from left to right, so it deals with f(n-1) exclusively until an answer is returned before dealing with f(n-2), right? I don't understand why f(0) is ever called because shouldn't f(1) return 1 so f(0) is never called?

  Yes, F(n-2) is not called until evaluation of F(n-1) is complete and its value is known.

 <p>
  You are right. F(0) should not be called after F(1) returns its value.

   The answer says that F(0) is called though?
