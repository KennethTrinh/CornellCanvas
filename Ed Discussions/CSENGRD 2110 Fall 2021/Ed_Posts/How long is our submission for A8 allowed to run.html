  In the pinned ed post, it states that our submission runs for 10-12 seconds. Currently, my method averages 7.8 second run time over 100 runs, but has some runs in those hundred that took upwards of 30 seconds. Is this acceptable?

  No. If any single map takes longer than 10-12 seconds, it is considered unsolved for that map. The submission should run for less than 10-12 seconds on every map.
