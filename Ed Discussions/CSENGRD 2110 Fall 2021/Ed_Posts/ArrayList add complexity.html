 If I have an ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; called aL of size n, then aL.add(0,5) takes O(n) time because it needs to shift n elements, which takes linear time.
</p>
<p>
 What if I did aL.add(1,5)? Would that be O(n-1) time? If so, does that simplify to O(n) or O(1)?

  It takes amortized time.

  Please read this Java Hyper Text entry:

  I would link the lecture but I forgot which one talked about amortized time :(((
