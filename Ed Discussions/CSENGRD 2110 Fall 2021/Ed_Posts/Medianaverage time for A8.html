  We did not make an average accessible. We are not asking for the time spent.

  That is because people spend quite different times on it.

  You can do the minimum and get a grade of 85. Many people choose this option.

  Others have a great time trying to optimize.

  Ok, I was curious so I can plan how much time I should spend on the assignment in order to complete it fully.
