 If A8 was offered in previous semesters, what was the median/average time for completion of the assignment?

  We did not make an average accessible. We are not asking for the time spent.
 </p>
 <p>
  That is because people spend quite different times on it.
 </p>
 <p>
  You can do the minimum and get a grade of 85. Many people choose this option.

  Others have a great time trying to optimize.

   Ok, I was curious so I can plan how much time I should spend on the assignment in order to complete it fully.
