 Just to confirm, would the correct answer to this question be:
</p>
<p>
 f(3), f(2), f(1)? or, would it be f(3), f(2), f(1), f(1)?

    I'm pretty sure the answer given is correct.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     F(3)
    </b>
    is called first. Since 3 is not equal to 0 or 1 you evaluate F(n-1) + F(n-2). Call F(n-1) where n = 3, which is
    <b>
     F(2)
    </b>
    , first. Since 2 is not equal to 0 or 1, then evaluate F(n - 1) where n = 2 first, which is
    <b>
     F(1)
    </b>
    . 1 equals 1, so F(1) returns 1. Then you evaluate F(n - 2) where n = 2 which is
    <b>
     F(0)
    </b>
    . F(0) returns 1. Then 1+1 is returned by the call of F(2). Now call F(n-2), where n = 3, which is
    <b>
     F(1)
    </b>
    . That returns 1, so F(3) returns 2 + 1, which is 3.
   </p>

    <p>
     In solving F(n-2), shouldn't n start out as 3? So it calls F(1), not F(0)?

      Not quite, remember that a full method call must terminate before the code that called said method can continue. This means F(2) must finish executing before F(n - 2) where n = 3 can be called. For F(2) to finish executing, both F(n - 1) where n = 2 an F(n - 2) where n = 2 must be called (i.e. F(1) and then F(0))

        Is this definitely the right answer? Gries saying the answer was incorrect makes sense to me so i just don't want to train myself to rethink this whole thing if it could potentially be wrong - is there somewhere else I can look too?

         Yes this is definitely the correct answer. Follow the train of thought in my explanation and hopefully that should clear up any confusion
