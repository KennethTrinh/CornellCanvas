  The answer key doesn't state both of these tests so I was wondering if testing them both is considered redundant and not unique enough

  In the implementation of isReverse, you usually first check lengths of each string and if they are not equal, you immediately return false. In this case, your two test cases are not unique because they test the same condition with the same outcome.
