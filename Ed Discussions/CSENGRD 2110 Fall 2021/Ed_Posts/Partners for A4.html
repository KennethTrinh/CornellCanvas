  Hi!

  On the A4 instructions sheet, it says that we can work with one partner. However, on CMS, there is no place to "group" with another student as usual, are we allowed to work together for DList and DListTest? If yes, do we submit seperately?

  Thank you!

  A4 was set up to allow 2 students to work together.

  A4-autohelper was not set up to allow 2 students to work together.

  There was no need for that, since A4 is not being graded. So it doesn't matter who submits.

  However, to remove confusion, I just fixed A4-auto-helper to allow 2 students to work together.

  A4 is not being graded? What do you mean by that? Is it just a completion grade or something or is it just for practice?
