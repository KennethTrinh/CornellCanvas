  It says: 1. TESTING METHOD SIZE. To do test size adequately, you have to create a tree with lots of nodes and see whether size() returns the right value. METHOD makeTree1 CREATES A "LARGE" TREE! USE IT TO TEST METHOD size()!

  Are we only supposed to use makeTree1? I made a new tree as well, but are we restricted to using makeTree1?

  You are not restricted, I made my own trees to test on as well as testing makeTree1().  However, using makeTree1() is simpler as it has been created for you as well as a diagram.  Also, you do not need to submit your own test cases.
