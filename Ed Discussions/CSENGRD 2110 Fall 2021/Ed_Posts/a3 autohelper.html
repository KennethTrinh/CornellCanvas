 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 A3Test.java was successful for all 6 methods in a3 and yet when I turned it in earlier, the autohelper feedback says "your A3.java does not compile". WAs wondering why it would say that? Can't seem to get into any office hours rn to ask. Thanks
</p>

  Are you sure you are running A3Test correctly?  The code you submitted should not even allow those tests to compile (unless you have additional code in your Eclipse project).
 </p>
 <p>
  Have you gone through the checklist in the "A1 #Autohelper" pinned note (adapting for A3 as necessary)?  The second bullet point in particular may apply to your situation.
