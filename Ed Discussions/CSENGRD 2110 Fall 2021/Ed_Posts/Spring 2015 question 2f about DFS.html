  I have a question about question 2f for prelim 2 Spring 2015 5:30. I attached the question and the referred graph. This is my logic for answering the question:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For DFS, the first thing we do is mark the node we're on as visited. So we mark node A. And then we go look at the children in a for loop. Since the question prompts us to do it alphabetically, we go look a B first and see if it's visited. Since it's not visited, we call DFS recursively on the subtree starting at node B. That gives us children D and F. We first check D since we're going alphabetically, realize its not visited, and recursively call DFS on the subtree D. We do this a couple more times until we get to node H, which is the final node with no children. So far we've visited in order: A,B,D,E,H. So now that we've reached the base case, the call stack will now go backward and complete each call i.e DFS on subtree E will end and then DFS on subtree D will end. The issue I have comes when I get to DFS on subtree B. Technically, we haven't finished our call of DFS on subtree B since we've only looked at one child and B has two children. By this logic, I thought F would be the next node visited,  and then after DFS on F, DFS on B would end and then DFS on the original tree A would continue by visiting C and G for a final visiting pattern of: A,B,D,E,H,F,C,G. However, the answer key states that node C is visited before node F for a final order of A,B,D,E,H,C,F,G. I was wondering why C is visited before F and if the reason I got that F is visited first is a result of a flaw in my logic. Thank you.

  I agree that the nodes will be visited in this order:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  A B D E H
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  At that point, the call-stack contains frames for all those calls, with the frame for
  <break>
  </break>
  H at the top of the stack.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Next, H has an unvisited neighbor, C, so a frame for the call on C is put on the stack.THe visited nodes are now
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  A B D E H C
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  That is why the sequence is as shown.

  Ah I see I forgot that the graph was undirected so that you could travel from H to C.Thank you!
