 Sorry if this has already been asked before.

 How do I take the A3.java and A3test.java files from canvas and put them into my newly created a3 package? I've forgotten how I did it with A2.

  A class's package is determined by the
  <code>
   package
  </code>
  line at the top of the file, so to put class
  <code>
   A3
  </code>
  in package
  <code>
   a3
  </code>
  , you would write
  <code>
   package a3;
  </code>
  as the first line of "A3.java".  It should also go in a folder named "a3".
 </p>
 <p>
  There are many ways to do this graphically in Eclipse as well, such as creating a new package and dragging the files into it.  But ultimately all that matters is the
  <code>
   package
  </code>
  line in the source code (and being in the right folder can be important when compiling larger projects).
