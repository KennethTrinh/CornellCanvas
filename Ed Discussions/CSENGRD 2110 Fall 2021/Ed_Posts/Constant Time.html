  Hello, I was wondering if it was acceptable if the insertAfter function called function append in some cases. Since append takes constant time and insertAfter takes constant time, it would be fine if one was called by the other, correct? I don't recall seeing anything about constant time functions calling other constant time functions and just wanted to make sure. Thank you

  If it works and you find it reasonable, fine.

  It is still constant time.
