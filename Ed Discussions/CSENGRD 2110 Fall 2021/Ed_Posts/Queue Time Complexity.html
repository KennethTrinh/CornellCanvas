 I am confused with the time complexity for the add() method of priority queue.   If it can be implemented with a linked list, would that mean add() can take O(1) instead of O(logn)?

  If you were to use a linked list, add() wouldn't be O(1) because you would have to bubble up to the correct priority (which would be O(n) and worse than a heap's implementation). For a heap, adding and bubbling up would take O(log n).
