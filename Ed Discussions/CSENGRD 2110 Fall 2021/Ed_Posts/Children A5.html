 This might be a silly question on something I missed, but in a loop like this:
</p>
<p>
 for (H1N1Tree tree : children)
</p>
<p>
 how do you access the person at each child? I tried children.person() and it had an error so I'm assuming it's something else.

  children is a set, not an H1N1Tree. Instead of declaring variable tree in that for-each statement, I suggest you use   child   , which give more meaning
