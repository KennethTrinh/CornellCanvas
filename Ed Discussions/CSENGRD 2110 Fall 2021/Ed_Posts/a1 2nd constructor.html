  that the elephant has mother a mother ma, and father pa, which I would assume to mean that mom and dad can't be null? But it wasn't in the precondition so I wasn't sure if we need to assert it, but in the case that the mom or dad is null, then the gender precondition can't be checked.

  The Precondition, shown below, says that ma is a female. It could not be a female if it were null, so it must be non-null as well. Yes, you have to check the latter case.

 <paragraph>
  Precondition: n has at least 1 character, y &gt;= 2000, g is 'F' for female or 'M' for male, m is in 1..12, ma is a female, and pa is a male.
