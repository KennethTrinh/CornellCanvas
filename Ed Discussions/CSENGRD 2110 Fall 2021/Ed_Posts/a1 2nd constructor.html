 For the 2nd constructor, do we need to assert that the mom and dad can't be null? Thank you

  The Precondition, shown below, says that ma is a female. It could not be a female if it were null, so it must be non-null as well. Yes, you have to check the latter case.
 </p>
 <p>
  Precondition: n has at least 1 character, y &gt;= 2000, g is 'F' for female or 'M' for male, m is in 1..12, ma is a female, and pa is a male.
 </p>

   What does the specification of the second constructor say?

    that the elephant has mother a mother ma, and father pa, which I would assume to mean that mom and dad can't be null? But it wasn't in the precondition so I wasn't sure if we need to assert it, but in the case that the mom or dad is null, then the gender precondition can't be checked.
