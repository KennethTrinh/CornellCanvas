  I tried to execute the demo of four seasons  but I can't see the picture popping up after I click the corresponding button. I think it's probably due to my package and file structure.

  Does it look right? Where should I put AvaSwing.java and where should I put all the jpgs. Thanks!

  The jpgs should not be in directory CS2110. They should be in directory GUIDemo2.

  Try dragging them over the main project, GUIDemo2.
