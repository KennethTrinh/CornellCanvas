 Hi! I am not sure the difference between paint and repaint? Is it one function that called automatically and one that we could manually called to see the changes made in frame ASAP?  Or is there any more important difference?
</p>
<p>
 Thanks!

  repaint() calls a paint function to get a component to repaint itself after a given change to the component.  If no change has been made to the component, repaint() makes no visible changes.
