 Why don't we have to change the methods if we are using quadratic probing? Shouldn't k=k+1 be changed to something like k = k + h, with h ranging from values (1, 4, 9, ...)? How would we account for quadratic probing then if nothing is changed in the iterator?

  All the array elements have to be checked:
 </p>
 <p>
  a. If b[k] contains null, the null is not enumerated.
 </p>
 <p>
  b. If b[k] contains something that it not null, it is enumerated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since this object is implementing a set, the order in which elements is up to the implementor. It has nothing to do with what kind of probing is used.
