  For all of our tests, to test for correctness, my partner and I just tested the value of the node to make sure it matched the intended value. Thus, we never used DList&lt;&gt;.Node to test the actual node object. Is this ok, or should we also test for the node object and not just the value? Thanks

  You need to be sure that it got the right node. You can test either it's address (pointer) or its value --but checking value only works if all values in the list are different.
