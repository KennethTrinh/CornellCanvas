  Why is that executing Kruskals algo on an unconnected graph with n components produce a forest of n spanning trees?

  By unconnected you mean undirected?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  From what I wrote down in office hours last Friday, Kruskal's algo picks the edge with the lowest weight that does not produce a cycle.  Spanning trees do not have cycles, so Kruskal's algo would produce spanning trees.

  unconnected does not mean undirected.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Prim and Kruskal always operate on undirected graphs.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The graph shown above has two unconnected components: nodes (A, B, C) and nodes (D, E).

  Oh thank you, I did not know what they meant by unconnected.  Thank you professor.

  Below is a graph consisting of two connected components.
  <break>
  </break>
  One contains nodes A, B, and C and one contains  nodes D and E.
  <break>
  </break>
  All the edges are shown.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  You can also see that each connected component is already a spanning tree.
  <break>
  </break>
  Isn't this a forest of two spanning trees?
