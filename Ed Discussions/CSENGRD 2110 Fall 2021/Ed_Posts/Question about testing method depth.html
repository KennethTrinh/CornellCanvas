 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 In the notes for "testing method depth" in A5, I'm a bit confused because it talks about testing the contain method:
</p>
<p>
 This is what it says:
</p>
<pre>    /* TESTING METHOD DEPTH.
     * Take a look at the tree produced by method makeTree1. We have:
     *    personA is at depth 0
     *    personB is at depth 1
     *    personC is at depth 1
     *    personD is at depth 2  and so on.
     *
     * Array people already contains personA, personB, personC, ..., personL
     * What if you constructed an array
     *
     *    int[] depths= {0, 1, 1, 2, ...}
     *
     * that contained the depth of each person in array people (including those
     * that are not in it)? You could then write a loop in method test3Contains
     * to test ALL of those people:
     *
     *    for (int k= 0; k &lt; people.length; k= k+1) {
     *        assertEquals(depths[k], a suitable call on contains, for you to do);
     *    }
     *
     * This is the work that has to go on to do adequate testing
     */</pre>
<p>
 I'm confused especially on this line:
</p>
<pre>assertEquals(depths[k], a suitable call on contains, for you to do);
</pre>
<p>
 because the contains method returns a boolean value which wouldn't line up with the values in "depths." Can this be explained to me please?
</p>

 <p>
  That should be a suitable call on depth, not contains.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks.
