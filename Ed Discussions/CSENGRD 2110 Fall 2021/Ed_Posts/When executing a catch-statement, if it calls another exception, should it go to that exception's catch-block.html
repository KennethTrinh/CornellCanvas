  In other words, can statements in a try-statement be caught by multiple catch-blocks?

  Exceptions are
  <italic>
   thrown
  </italic>
  , not called (though they can be constructed).
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  When an exception is thrown, it will be handled by the
  <code>
   catch
  </code>
  block associated with the nearest
  <bold>
   enclosing
  </bold>
  <code>
   try
  </code>
  block.  A
  <code>
   try
  </code>
  block does not enclose its own
  <code>
   catch
  </code>
  blocks.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Exceptions can be (re-)thrown in a
  <code>
   catch
  </code>
  block.  Such exceptions would have to be handled by a different try/catch statement higher in the call stack.

  Got it, okay then I am confused on the question I put in post #628 - if the exception can still be thrown, why isn't it caught by the RuntimeException?
