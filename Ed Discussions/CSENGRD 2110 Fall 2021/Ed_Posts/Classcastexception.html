  Why does Animal a = (Cat) new Animal(); throw a classcastexpression when a cat is a type of animal? I get it when a classcastexpression is thrown because animal was earlier declared as a dog and then Animal a = (Cat) new Animal(); because a dog is not a cat but I don't understand why a classcastexpression when animal is not already declared as a subtype

  Below is an object of class Animal. Does it have a partition named  Cat?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  No. Therefore, casting it to Cat can't be done.
