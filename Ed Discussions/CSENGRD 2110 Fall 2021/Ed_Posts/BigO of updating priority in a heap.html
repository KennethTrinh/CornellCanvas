  A7 says that the worst case time complexity of changePriority(T v, double p) is linear in the size of the array and the expected complexity is O(logn). Its method body uses a hashmap to retrieve the index of the value (constant time) before executing bubbleUp or bubbleDown as needed (logarithmic). When would this result in a linear time complexity? Or does this linear worst case complexity refer to when there is no hashmap so each node must be traversed to find the node specified?

  Its method uses a HashMap to retrieve something. The expected time for HashMap is O(1) but the worst-case is O(n) ---e.g. when the hash function turns all values into the same integer.
