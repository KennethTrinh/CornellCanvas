 If the doubly linked list is sorted could the time complexity be O(log n) (use binary search to get to the node)?

  How much time does it take to find a node i in the doubly linked list?

   O(n). Not sure what you mean, but are you trying to say that it's also O(n) for when the list is sorted?

    You asked whether the binary search could be log n. I asked you a question that helped you answer your own question, that is all. How could it be O(log n) if it took O(n) to look at a particular element?

     Thanks for your help. Still I'm not sure that I understand. Could it be that since I don't know if the array is being search using binary search then I can only assume it's a linear search which runs at O(n).

      Basically, since it already takes O(n) to search
      <i>
       one
      </i>
      element, there's no way it can take O(log n) to do a complete binary search (which involves searching a bunch of elements)
     </p>

       Binary search through an array is O(log n) because finding an element given an index i is O(1). Remember that indexing an array is O(1). Indexing a doubly linkedlist is not constant time. Going to a particular index i will take i/n-i traversals(whichever one is less), since there's no way to simply jump to a specific index. We would have to start at the tail or head and count our way to a specific index(doing something like node = node.next or node = node.prev inside a loop most likely if that helps). So definitely O(n).
