  Should we have 2 base cases for depth() where one returns 0 and the other returns -1? Right now, I only have a base case that returns 0; how do I write the one that returns -1 if we can't use node() or contains()?

  Don't consider the case of returning -1.

  Just write the base case that returns 0.

  If recursively calling all the children doesn't terminate the loop in its repetend, then, after the loop it is time to return -1.

  Does that mean we should terminate the recursion when our value is not equal to -1? If we do sum = 1 + depth of p in c and return the sum, then the sum would never equal -1 right?

  I don't have to answer this. Figure it out.
