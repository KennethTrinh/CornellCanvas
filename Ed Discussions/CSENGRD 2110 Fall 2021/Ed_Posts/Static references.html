  What's it mean when the IDE says: "cannot make a static reference to a non-static method".
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I know I can fix that by tacking on "static" to the non-static method I'm trying to use, but why is it that referencing something non-static from a static method an issue?

  Thank you

  What does non-static mean? Where is a non-static method?

  When hover my mouse over the red lines, I'm told that I can't make a static reference to a non-static method.

  Yes. A non-static method is in every single object. So how can you reference a non-static object if you don't have an object to point to? Make the method static.
