 Java Hypertext says that as long as an objected can be constructed that has a c partition and a name partition, then the code will compile. So will the two lines below both compile?
</p>
<p>
 Dog d = (Animal) d;
</p>
<p>
 Animal d = (Dog) d;
</p>

   Please read the other note you just posted. I answered that and that should help here.

    Does the same rule apply for casting? I can only cast an Animal to a dog but I can't cast a dog to an animal?
