  Java Hypertext says that as long as an objected can be constructed that has a c partition and a name partition, then the code will compile. So will the two lines below both compile?

  Dog d = (Animal) d;

  Animal d = (Dog) d;

  Does the same rule apply for casting? I can only cast an Animal to a dog but I can't cast a dog to an animal?
