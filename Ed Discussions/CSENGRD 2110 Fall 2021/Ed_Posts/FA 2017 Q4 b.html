 For the first case when both p and q are null why is that true? Is that true because either p and q are pointing to null (i.e is there only one null object in memory?)  or we've reached the end of both trees and we only expect null to be attached to the leaves?

  The definition given says that trees p and q are the same if they have the same structure and value. Two empty trees have the same structure so it is true that they are the same.
