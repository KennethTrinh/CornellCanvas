 Hello friends,
</p>
<p>
 We are a bit confused about wrapping our heads around BTrees and what it means to "print the values of this BTree in ascending order".
</p>
<p>
 We are also confused about the second diagram, node1, node2, and node3. If node1, node2, and node3 are lists of integers (keys), then what is 22? Should it not be a list as well, since it is  BTreeNode, and if so, where is 22 coming from?
</p>
<p>
 Thank you!
</p>

  BTrees were not taught this semester and won't be on the final.
