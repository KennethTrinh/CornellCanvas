 Do method names matter for collection classes and ADTs? What I mean is how in one the method is called "insert()" while the other has "add()", would it matter if we mixed up the names as long as we knew how each performed?

  You should know the most common method names for Java Collection classes (
  <code>
   add()
  </code>
  ,
  <code>
   remove()
  </code>
  ,
  <code>
   size()
  </code>
  ,
  <code>
   get()
  </code>
  ,
  <code>
   poll()
  </code>
  , etc.).
 </p>
 <p>
  For more abstract settings you should have a sense for what an "insert" operation would do, for example, but you don't need to memorize specific names; we'll either give you the desired API (with hopefully obvious names), or we'll accept any answer in English that makes it clear what operation you are referring to.
