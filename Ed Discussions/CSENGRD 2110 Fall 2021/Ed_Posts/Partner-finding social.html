  You are allowed and encouraged to work with a partner on the programming assignments in this course.  But you may not know your classmates well enough yet to find someone with similar interests and a compatible schedule.  To help with that, the college is sponsoring a partner-finding social next Thursday, Sept. 9 - we hope you'll check it out!
