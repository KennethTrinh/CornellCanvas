  At what point do exceptions are errors actually cause termination? For example if we have a call that throws an exception (with no try-catch block implemented, the exception gets thrown out of that method call to where it was called. At what point does this actually terminate the process? Similarly, if we have a method call throw an error, does that instantly terminate or also get thrown out of the method call and terminate later? Thank you!

  If an exception is thrown and not caught, the program halts.

  So in this case, is it thrown out of the call of foo in p, and THEN the program halts?

  If foo() doesn't catch the exception, then it is thrown all the way up to until it is either caught by a method in the call stack or not caught by any of them at which point the program halts
