  The instructions in A1 recommend we test the preconditions for "(1) In the first constructor, the nickname of the element is at least one character long. For this, be sure to read carefully the section on “Using the Java assert statement” on page 2. (2) The precondition of procedure addMom()."

  Is it okay if these are the only assert statements we test or should we test others?

  It's up to you how many Preconditions you test for.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  In total, there are 15-20 individual preconditions. If you don't test, and you get 4-5 of them wrong, you will lose only about 1/100 points on A1
