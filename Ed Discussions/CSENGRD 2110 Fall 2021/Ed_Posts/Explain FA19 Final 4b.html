 Can you explain. I selected B but the answer is C. My answer was pretty much a guess. I believe I understand why A and D are okay, but not why B is okay and C is not.

  Yes, another way, to look into it is to observe the sequence. Initially, I tried in that way, just a thought.

   For B you stack up to D then pop, push E, then pop 4 times. For C you stack up to D, pop twice, then push E, pop, and you're left with no more pushes, so the only thing you can do is pop, but that would give you B, A, so this is invalid.
