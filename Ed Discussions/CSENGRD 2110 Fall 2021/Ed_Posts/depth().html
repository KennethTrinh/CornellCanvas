 I'm having trouble understanding how to design this. I know I need to be using a searching method but the examples given are for returning of type Node. In this scenario, we need to keep a global track of the depth and then somehow exit the recursion as soon as we find our value, but I don't see how you can do that under the current constraints. Any return value has to be an integer, so what do you return so that the loop will terminate? I also know it will probably look something like 1 + depth() but then I get confused because leaves in the tree can break the recursion because I can't come up with a proper base case.

  You are thinking too hard about this. I have no idea about why the thoughts you are express are arising.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yes, it's a searching method. What does the return type have to do with it?
 </p>
 <p>
  First, what is the base case? In what case do you now the answer immediately?
  <break>
  </break>
  Write that down in your code.
 </p>
 <p>
  Second, look at the searching pattern and have your method have essentially the same.
  <break>
  </break>
  You call the method recursively on the children. and stop the recursion when one of the calls returns something not -1.
 </p>
 <p>
  Use the recursive definition we give you:
 </p>
 <p>
  // Here is recursive insight:
  <break>
  </break>
  // ... Let child c of the root contain p.
  <break>
  </break>
  // ... Then the depth of p in the root = (1 + depth of p in c)
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
