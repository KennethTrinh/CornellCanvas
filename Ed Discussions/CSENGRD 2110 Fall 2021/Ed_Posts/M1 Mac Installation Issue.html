  I'm trying to install Eclipse on my new M1 Mac, but it keeps crashing even after I downloaded the old Eclipse version (12-20) and after I got Rosetta 2. Is there a way to fix this issue?

  : If you have a new Apple MacBook with the M1 chip, Eclipse may crash when you open it. Some got around this problem by using Eclipse 2020-12:

  I downloaded the Mac installer file in this link and Eclipse still crashes for me. Is there a reason why it's crashing?

  You'll have to see a staff member in person for this.

  This is the first time we have seen this. Google the internet to see if others have had this problem.
