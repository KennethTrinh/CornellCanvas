  What should we be reading in JHT for hashing? The schedule just says "tutorial on hashing." Does that mean the tab that says "Hashing" in JHT?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thank you for the clarification!

  At the very end, the JavaHypterText reading says only "tutorial on hashing."

  Yes, the tab at the top of JHT that says "Hashing" leads to the Hashing tutorial - click Prof. Gries's face to watch the videos.  Parts of the tutorial will walk through an actual implementation of a hash table, which can help make the lecture concepts more concrete.

  At the end of the tutorial are several links.  The one on linear probing, quadratic probing, and double hashing is good to read.  The others are only there if you are interested.
