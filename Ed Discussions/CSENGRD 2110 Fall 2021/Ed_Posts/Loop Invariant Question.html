 Why does the segment b[k...n] say inside of it original b[t + 1...n]? Doesn't b[t+1...k-1] contain don't cares?

  No, b[k..n] does not contain any dups. There are potentially dups in the b[0..t] part. This can be accomplished by processing from right to left. It's done this way so that your final array can look like the post condition provided.

   Right, but I'm not seeing quite why b[t+1...n] includes don't cares and the original without dups
  </p>
  <p>
   They're also saying the original b[t+1...n], so what's included in there? don't cares and original without dups?

    It might be easier to think of b[t+1...n] as two separate regions where b[t+1..k-1] is don't cares which holds the duplicates you want to remove from the original list and b[k..n] is the part of the original array but without the duplicates.

    I don't think I fully understand your question so let me know if I can clarify my answer.

     So the duplicates get moved to the don't care segment?

      Yes, the don't care section is where all the duplicates from the b[k..n] section go.
