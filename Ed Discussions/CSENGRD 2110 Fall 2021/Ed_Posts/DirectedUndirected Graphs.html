 Why can't directed graphs be converted to undirected graphs while maintaining paths? Can't the vertices be extracted from the pairs, put into 2 element sets and added to edges (if the same set hasn't already been added)?

  Ithaca has some one-way streets.

  How are you going to indicate that on an undirected graph?

   Thanks, this now makes sense! I was only thinking about implementation, not about application.
