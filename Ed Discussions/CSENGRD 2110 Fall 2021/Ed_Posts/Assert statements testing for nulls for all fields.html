 Hello,
</p>
<p>
 I was wondering if we needed to add a conditional testing that every field is not equal to null. I know we have to test for n, but I was wondering if that applied to every other field. Do we only have to test for nulls for strings?
</p>
<p>
 Also should we use a new assert statement to test each field or is it acceptable to condense all of them into one statement?
</p>

  1.  Please look at each precondition and make that judgement yourself --whether you have to test for null.
 </p>
 <p>
  2. You can go either way. Either put a separate assert statement for each precondition for put them all into one assert statement. You decide, based on which (in each case) is easier to read and which takes few lines.
