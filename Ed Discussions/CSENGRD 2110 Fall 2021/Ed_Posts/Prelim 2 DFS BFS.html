  Should we try to know all of the algorithms for DFS and BFS (recursive, iterative, optimized iterative)? Also, does "being able to write" the algorithms for DFS and BFS mean that we should know how to write them using high-level statements, like with the sorting algorithms?

  We wrote two recursive dos methods in class. You should be able to develop them yourself, using high-level statements as done in lecture.

  You should be able to write the iterative versions of DFS and BFS as well. Just know the loop invariant, e.g. for DFS:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Every node that is to be marked a visited is reachable along
  <break>
  </break>
  an unvisited path of nodes from some node on the stack.
