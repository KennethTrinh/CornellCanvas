 If I choose this class for "audition" ( I am an graduate student), then do I need to finish every-week assignment and final exam as they appear on my to do list?
</p>
<p>
 And also, what about the "Disscussion" on every Wednesday afternoon I enrolled? Do I need to drop it or take this course on time?

  If you choose this class for "Audit" (not "audition"), then you do not have to do any homework or assignments and you do not have to take Any tests. You do not receive a grade, except "Audit". You do not receive official credit for the course. You are just there to listen and learn and do whatever you want.

    In that case, will my homework/assignments/tests still be checked/graded? Can I still do the project with the class?

     Yes, as long as you are enrolled, we will grade and provide feedback on any assignments that you turn in on time.
