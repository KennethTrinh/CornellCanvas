 Hello. I had a lot of fun with the sewers project. But I was hoping to just make a suggestion for next semester considering we don't have the feedback slot for this project.
</p>
<p>
 It's not clear, at least to me, that one step is NOT equivalent to traversing one node on the graph. Considering that McDiver on the GUI is literally stepping from tile to tile in a constant number of steps, this is very confusing. Yes, A7 has sumofPath, but since I assumed one step = moving one tile, I wasted A LOT of time bug testing since I just did dijkstra(start, end).size(). Obviously, there are some ways to realize this, as I eventually was able to figure it out, but I think is a rather glaring miscommunication. I think it would be in everybody's best interest to either change the wording on the project, or make a note of it in the handout.
</p>

 Apologies if this was discussed elsewhere, or in a lecture I missed, but I did not see mention of it. Super fun project in total, but this is my two cents.

  Thanks for the comment!

  We will make sure that this point is made clearer next time we have a similar assignment.
