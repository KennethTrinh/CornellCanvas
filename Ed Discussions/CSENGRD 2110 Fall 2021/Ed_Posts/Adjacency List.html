  On the slides I found that the time complexity of finding if v1 is adjacent to v2 is v+#edges leaving v1. If we implement the adjacency list using an array or an array list instead of a linked list, would the complexity just be the #edges from v1 instead?

  Answer that question yourself, giving an explanation, and then we will look at your answer and comment on it.

  Using an array will take #edges of node v1 time because finding node V1 in the array is constant time. In a linked list finding a specific node requires going through the list. If this is true, when would a linked list be preferable over an array list? Does it have to do with space complexity?

  Why does using an array or ArrayList make it constant time? That array or ArrayList contains a number of nodes. You still have to search that array or ArrayList for the node.

  I thought in an array the nodes would be numbered so if we want the node labeled 4 we just go to v[4] but the answer is probably that the nodes can also have strings as labels or something else. But then how does an adjacency matrix take constant time to do the same thing?

  Assume that the nodes are not numbered --they could be objects. You have to look through the array or ArrayList looking for the one you want.

  Got it. In that case, how does an adjacency matrix take constant time to perform the same action?

  With an adjacency matrix, the nodes have to be numbered 0..n-1 or 1..n!
