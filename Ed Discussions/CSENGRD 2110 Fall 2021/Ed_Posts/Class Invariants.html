  I'm a little unsure how to apply class invariants to A1. The rubric says:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  "The class invariant is not correct â€”not all fields are properly defined, along with necessary constraints, and/or it is not given in Javadoc comments."
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  What exactly do we need to comment with regards to class invariants, and where does this comment go?

  You can wait until we cover class invariants in next lecture, or at least until we make the slides for the lecture available (by tomorrow afternoon).

  Also, look up "class invariant" JavaHyperText.
