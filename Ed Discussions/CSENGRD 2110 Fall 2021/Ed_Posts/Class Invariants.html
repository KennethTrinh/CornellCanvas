 I'm a little unsure how to apply class invariants to A1. The rubric says:
</p>
<p>
 "The class invariant is not correct —not all fields are properly defined, along with necessary constraints, and/or it is not given in Javadoc comments."
</p>
<p>
 What exactly do we need to comment with regards to class invariants, and where does this comment go?
</p>

  You can wait until we cover class invariants in next lecture, or at least until we make the slides for the lecture available (by tomorrow afternoon).
 </p>
 <p>
  Also, look up "class invariant" JavaHyperText.
