 I didn't find any submission on CMS. Is this because I am auditing this course?

  When did you add the course? The CMS does not automatically have every student in it that is enrolled in the course. Once a day, we have to manually synch the Cornell system, and the CMS. I just added you to the CMS now. So you should see the CMS for CS21110 now.
