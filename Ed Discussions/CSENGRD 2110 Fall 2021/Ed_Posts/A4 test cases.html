  Hi, I had a question about test cases. If I call prepend multiple times in my test case, do I have to test with toString, toStringR, and size each time I call prepend? Or can I just test once at the end with the three methods?

  It is best at the beginning to put those three after each test case.

  However, once you gain some confidence that your method is correct, you can for the rest of them put the m put the three calls on toString, toStringR, and size only after the last.
