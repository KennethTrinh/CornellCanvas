<pre>results1.txt:
Checking DListTest.java:

Using your version of DListTest to test our implementation of class DList.
There should be no test failures and no extraneous output, and the number of
tests executed should match the number that you have implemented.

Passed 4 / 4 tests
Code-under-test wrote 20 bytes of extraneous output</pre>
<p>
 What does extraneous output mean in relation to the testing file?  Or is it not related to the testing file?  I believe the later is the case as the amount of output increased on my second submission on the auto helper when I added assertion statements on the main file but did not change the testing file.

  Not 100% sure and you should wait for an instructor to answer, but do you have a print statement in either of your java files?

   Good interpretation - this feedback suggests that your DListTest class contains print statements and produces console output.  Extraneous console output tends to cause issues when code is integrated into larger systems, so we discourage it in code that you submit.  (Printing is still a very useful debugging strategy, but temporary debugging code should removed before release.)
