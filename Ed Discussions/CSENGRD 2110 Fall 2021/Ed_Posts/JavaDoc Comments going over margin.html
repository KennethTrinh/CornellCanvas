 Is keeping our lines, such as the JavaDoc comments, before the 80 character margin something we should concern ourself with, and will we have points taken off for lines that don't do this.
</p>
<p>
 This was the case for cs 1110, so I assume it's the case for this class. I ask because some of the javadoc comments, especially for the constructors, tend to go over the 80 character margin. When i try to format them so that none of the lines go over the margin, and I save, the automatic editing that occurs when saving changes it so that some of the lines go over the margin again. I am pretty sure I have all of the preferences imported and changed like I'm supposed to, but i might be wrong.

  Try to keep them short. Place

  which is the html tag for "line break" where you would

  like to begin a new line. For example, when you type the following in a javadoc comment and then save the file,
 </p>
 <p>
  Here are words, &lt;br&gt; but line should not be too long,
 </p>
 <p>
  It will be changed to

  but line should not be too long,

    It's OK if lines are a bit longer than 80 chars.
