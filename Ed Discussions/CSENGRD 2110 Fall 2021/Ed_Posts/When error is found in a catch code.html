 For part c, does this mean that "catch (Throwable e)..." doesn't catch the Throwable? and if so why?

  Have you memorized (or do you have it before you) the steps in executing the try-statement?

  Only exceptions that are thrown in the try-block are caught by the catch clauses. S4 is not in the try-block; S2 is.
