  Yes, those types are always converted to
  <code>
   int
  </code>
  when performing mathematical operations.  This can be a bit surprising, but fortunately we don't use the smaller integer types very much.

  I am still confused... I thought byte can also be converted to a character?

  Any primitive type can be converted to another (possibly with a loss of information) by using a
  <italic>
   cast
  </italic>
  .
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  However, Java will also
  <italic>
   automatically
  </italic>
  convert some types to wider ones in certain circumstances.  For example, when adding an
  <code>
   int
  </code>
  and a
  <code>
   double
  </code>
  , the
  <code>
   int
  </code>
  will first be converted to a
  <code>
   double
  </code>
  , and then the
  <code>
   +
  </code>
  operator will act on two
  <code>
   double
  </code>
  values.  The rule is that all operands are converted to the type of the widest operand.  This rule works well for
  <code>
   int
  </code>
  ,
  <code>
   long
  </code>
  ,
  <code>
   float
  </code>
  , and
  <code>
   double
  </code>
  .
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For the other types, an additional rule comes into play.  Those types don't actually have any mathematical operators of their own - there is no
  <code>
   +
  </code>
  operator that adds two
  <code>
   byte
  </code>
  s and returns a
  <code>
   byte
  </code>
  , for example.  In those cases, Java again automatically converts operands to a wider type that
  <italic>
   does
  </italic>
  have the requested operation.  The narrowest such type is
  <code>
   int
  </code>
  , so those types will all be converted to at least
  <code>
   int
  </code>
  in order to do math on them, even if there is no other
  <code>
   int
  </code>
  operand.
