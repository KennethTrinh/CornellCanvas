  Hello,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I could not understand what was meant by this. What's the difference between a field and a local variable? Don't both use
  <code>
   private
  </code>
  ?

  Did you try typing     field       and       local   into JavaHperText? You would have found your answer much more quickly
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  A field is a variable defined as non-static in a class. In what's below, f is a field. A local variable is a variable declared in a method. Below, v is a local variable
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  class C {
  <break>
  </break>
  int f;
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  void m() {
  <break>
  </break>
  int v;
  <break>
  </break>
  ...
 </paragraph>

  }
  <break>
  </break>
  }
