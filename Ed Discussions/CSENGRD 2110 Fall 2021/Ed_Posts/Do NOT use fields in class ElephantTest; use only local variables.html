 Hello,
</p>
<p>
 I could not understand what was meant by this. What's the difference between a field and a local variable? Don't both use
 <code>
  private
 </code>
 ?
</p>

  Did you try typing     field       and       local   into JavaHperText? You would have found your answer much more quickly
 </p>
 <p>
  A field is a variable defined as non-static in a class. In what's below, f is a field. A local variable is a variable declared in a method. Below, v is a local variable
 </p>
 <p>
  class C {
  <break>
  </break>
  int f;
 </p>
 <p>
  void m() {
  <break>
  </break>
  int v;
  <break>
  </break>
  ...
 </p>
 <p>
  }
  <break>
  </break>
  }
  <break>
  </break>
 </p>
