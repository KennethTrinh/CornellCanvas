 Hello everyone! I just took Quiz 1, and afterwards, I saw that we are not able to see our scores. I understand why we cannot see what questions we got wrong. However, without seeing my score, I am unable to gauge how well I understand the material, and then "fix" my understanding before the quiz deadline. Is this an intentional feature? I was just wonder if we were supposed to be able to see our scores after the first attempt. Thank you!
