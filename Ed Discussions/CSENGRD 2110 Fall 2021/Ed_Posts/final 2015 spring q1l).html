 Relatively simple question but why is this false? If two strings are the same sequence of characters which I would think it means is two strings that are essentially the same length and same characters. Why would they not be equal in value?

  You have to show us the question!

  If it is using  s1 == s2, that is true if and only if s1 and s2 point to the same object.

   So if we have two different string objects that have the exact same value and we use ==, it would still return false, correct?
