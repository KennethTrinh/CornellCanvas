 Title: Can you only use "this" to delegate to another constructor if the other constructor has the same name (ie. the constructor is overloaded)?

  The question is a bit unclear. Can you try providing an example?
 </p>
 <p>
  But from what I understand, if you are asking if you can have an overloaded constructor that only contains a this statement, then yes. For instance:
 </p>
 <pre>class Book {
    public String title; 

    public Book(String m_title)
    {
        this.title = m_title;
    }
    
    public Book()
    {
        this("Untitled");
    }
}
</pre>
 <p>
  Using the above example, if one were to create two book objects:
  <code>
   Book a = new Book();
  </code>
  and
  <code>
   Book b = new Book("Intro to Python")
  </code>
  , book 'a' would have a title of "Untitled" and book 'b' would have a title of Intro to Python.
 </p>

   Yes, use only "this". But you are getting ahead of everything.

   Please don't ask questions about a lecture contents before the lecture is given.
