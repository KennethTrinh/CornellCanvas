  The directions of routeTo() (which I am considering to be a searching function) state that we can't use a new expression to make a list in the recursive case. But if we don't make a new list, then how are we supposed to add elements to a list that doesn't exist? I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do.

  It does not say that you can't declare a List variable, it just say you don't need an expression like
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  new LinkedList&lt;Person&gt;
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Suppose you have a recursive call on function H1N1RouteTo. What does it return?

  The recursive call returns the path from root to the desired node.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  So, would I be able to initially declare a variable like:         LinkedList&lt;Person&gt; thepath;
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  and then just append/prepend to it? Would that work?

  Well, make that an assignment declaration --assign to it the results of a recursive call.
