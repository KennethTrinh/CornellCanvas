  For example, before declaring int y in my constructor, am I expected to write an assert statement that says "assert y &gt;=2000"? I know my question is similar to #3 on post #105, but I'm still confused.

  Why are you declaring   int y;   in the body of the constructor?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  y is declared as a parameter of the constructor; you should not be declaring it again.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Yes, because of the Precondition, put in the assert statement "assert y &gt;=2000;"

  Whoops, thank you - I used the wrong terminology in saying I was declaring it again. I was just setting this.y = y in the body of the constructor.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Why can't the assert statement be put above the variable declaration of y? is there a reason it has to be above where I assign parameter y to field y in the constructor body ?

  There IS not declaration of y in the body. Please use correct terminology.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  this.y= y; is NOT a declaration of y, it is simply an assignment.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  We prefer that the assert statement be placed BEFORE this assignment statement. But note that the assert statement must use parameter y and not field this.y.
