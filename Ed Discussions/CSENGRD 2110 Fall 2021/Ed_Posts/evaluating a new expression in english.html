  I know this isn't in the exact words that it is on Java Hypertext, but I was wondering if this would also be a valid way to explain how a "new" expression is evaluated (I sometimes find terminology  to be be tricky so I just want to be sure I don't have this wrong):
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1. create a new object of the class name with default values
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. fill in the values according to constructor call
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  3. store name of folder as the name of the object that variable should point to
 </paragraph>

  1. This is OK.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. This is wrong. You don't know it is going to fill in values. If the call is new C(...),
  <break>
  </break>
  you should write:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Execute the constructor call C(...) .
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  3. This is wrong. There is no variable to store it into. all you have is a new expression.
  <break>
  </break>
  Suppose the new-expression was used like this:   (new C()).toString();  The value of the new-expression is not being stored anywhere. Here is how to write step 3.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Use as value of the new-expression a pointer to (or the name of) the new object.
