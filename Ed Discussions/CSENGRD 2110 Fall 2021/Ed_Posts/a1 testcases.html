  i know we're expected to try to make our testcases cover
  <italic>
   all
  </italic>
  potential inputs for each method, so does that mean we should be creating a ton of new different types of elements with different qualities (for ex, one elephant will have everything 'normal' except its name will be an empty string while another elephant will have everying 'normal except its birth-year will be 3000 etc.)?

  i just feel like there are so many possible 'weird' inputs that i should test for and that means creating a LOT of elephants in each of my testing units (the constructor units in particular)

  I think the best answer here is to use your judgement to cover the cases. In this week's recitation, we are covering a couple of approaches to testing, which you can definitely apply to answer this question, so if you have recitation tomorrow, it might be helpful to approach testing here using one or multiple of the types of testing discussed.

  And if you have already had recitation, think about the types of testing we talked about in recitation. Which of them can you apply to the project?

  What you want is good code coverage: Each part of the program must be executed or evaluated in at least one test case.
