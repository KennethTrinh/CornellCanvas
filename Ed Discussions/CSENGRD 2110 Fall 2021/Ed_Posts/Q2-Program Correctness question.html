  I look at look at the quiz on CMS due tomorrow and we did not cover this in discussion sections at all. Were we supposed to cover this during discussion or use JavaHyperText to do this quiz?

  You were supposed to do the tutorial on program correctness this weekend. If you did that tutorial, you should have no trouble with the quiz.
