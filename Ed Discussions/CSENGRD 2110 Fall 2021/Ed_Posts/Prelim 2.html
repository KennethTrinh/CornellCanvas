  I do not understand the base condition. I thought s==t is comparing s and t's pointers, and we are interested in checking if the trees have the same shape and values. I thought the base case would be:  if (s==null &amp;&amp; t==null) return true;

  The base case is a null check. If both are null, then return true. If only one is null, return false.

  Why does s==t yield true when they are both null? I thought s==t will only be true if they point to the same node

  If they both point to some node (which is not null), then they won't pass the test, the program goes to the recursive calls.

  Oh so if they are both null they don't point to anything and s==t is true?

  Yeah I think "null == null" evaluates to "true". The reason we have to implement this equals method is that we don't want reference comparison when they both are not null. They could be different objects in memory, but they may have the same shape and values.

  I am assuming that   null   represents the empty tree. If both are null, then both are the empty tree and equal.
