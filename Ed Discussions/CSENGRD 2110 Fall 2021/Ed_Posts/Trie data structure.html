  I am having some trouble trying to reason through this solution. I think the biggest trouble I am running into is understanding that is meant by "n strings with a maximum length m." Does this mean there are a maximum of n nodes in this trie structure, with the maximum length of each node being m?

  The maximum length m refers to the longest path from the root to a leaf. In this example, it is 3, for example the string "inn" fits this. As you can see, the number n of strings have nothing to do with the answer.

  When searching for a string of length k that is in the trie, well, it takes time O(k) to see that it is in.

 <paragraph>
  When searching for a string that is not in the trie, well, at most one would have to look at m branches.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Hence the time min(m, k).

  And just to confirm, the "n strings" is referring to the total number of complete words, or simply just the number of nodes?
