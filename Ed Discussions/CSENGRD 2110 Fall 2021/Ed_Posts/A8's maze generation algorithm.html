 Anybody have any idea what the algorithm used to generate random mazes in A8 is? I wonder if finding an optimal solution would be easier if we knew how the mazes were generated. I can't really tell by looking at the code in Sewers, though, it doesn't look anything like Prim or Kruskal's or any maze generation algorithm I've come across.

  That's an interesting idea. Hadn't heard it before. But I don't think it will help. At least at this stage, with A8 due tonight.

  I looked once at how the maps were constructed. It's not easy to understand. I doubt whether knowledge of it would be of benefit in finding an optimal solution.
