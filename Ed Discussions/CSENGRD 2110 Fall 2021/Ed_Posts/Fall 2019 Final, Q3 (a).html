  Is this also accepted? Especially for the repetend, since it worked for the test cases I tried with? Thanks:

  The loop condition must be:  t &lt; j.
  <break>
  </break>
  If t = j, the    ? section is empty and nothing more should be done.

  Look at the invariant. It says that b[h..t-1] contains B[h..j-1] with 0's removed. Therefore, during the iteration, ONLY b[j] should be looked at. And if it is not 0, it should be placed in b[t] and t should be incremented. Then, in all cases, in crease j by 1.

  You are not looking carefully enough at the invariant and what it means. Sorry.
