 How do we go about finding the amount of time our program takes to complete each seed? I have run quite a few seeds but I cannot find the value associated with the amount of time it took.

  It doesn't print that information. You can print the elapsed time yourself.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you don't know how to do that, type
 </p>
 <p>
  elapsed
 </p>
 <p>
  into the JavaHyperText Filter Field and you'll see simple instructions there.
