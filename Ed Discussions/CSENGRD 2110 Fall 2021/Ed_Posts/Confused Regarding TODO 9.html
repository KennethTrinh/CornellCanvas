 I am asking this question on ED because no one showed up to consulting hours today during 6-7pm.
</p>
<p>
 The GUI handout states:
</p>
<p>
 "Start with TODO 9 in GameMain for showing the score in the score label. As with TODO 3, the work to be performed should be specified in an anonymous function, which is passed to a method of the object that will be generating the events (in this case, the GameComponent game). Search the documentation for that object’s superclasses to find an appropriate method; look for an overload that will only listen for changes to the “GameScore” property."
</p>
<p>
 By "object's super classes," does this mean GameComponent's superclass like Jpanel?
</p>
<p>
 And for addPropertyChangeListener, would I have to add scoreLabel as one of the parameters?  I did not understand the documentation for said method very well.
</p>

  If you plan on invoking a method on
  <code>
   game
  </code>
  in order to register a new listener, then yes, the target's superclasses would be those of
  <code>
   GameComponent
  </code>
  , namely
  <code>
   JPanel
  </code>
  ,
  <code>
   JComponent
  </code>
  ,
  <code>
   Component
  </code>
  , etc.
 </p>
 <p>
  Re
  <code>
   addPropertyChangeListener()
  </code>
  , what are the types of its input parameter(s)?  Is
  <code>
   scoreLabel
  </code>
  's type a subtype of any of those?  In general, when registering a listener, one argument will be an anonymous function (or other implementation of the appropriate Listener interface).  If there are additional parameters, the documentation should clarify what they are (e.g. a property name to filter for).

  I'm sorry to hear that no one appeared to be serving the consulting queue this evening; we've asked our consultants to double-check their calendar appointments to ensure that the calendar is accurate; I hope this doesn't happen again.
