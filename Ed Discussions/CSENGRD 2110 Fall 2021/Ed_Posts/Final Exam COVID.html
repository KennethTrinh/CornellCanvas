 I know you are all being inundated with Ed posts right now, the student body is in crisis. Many of my friends have tested positive this week, let alone within the last 24 hours.
</p>
<p>
 I am requesting the course staff consider a note sheet for everyone on the exam. I do not care whether the exam is in person or online, today or next week, I just want a notes sheet on the exam.
</p>
<p>
 Students right now are in crisis, many of us stressing that we will give COVID to their family and friends and for many that can mean serious consequences. Not a single student right now has their head screwed on right, but there are two hours until the exam still which is enough time for everyone to write down those few lines they would be cramming in their heads in this moment if we were not in a crisis.
</p>
<p>
 Please, please consider helping students out here. I have yet to see any sense of care for mental health here at Cornell. Professors who show kindness in the eleventh hours are the only people who can help.

  Also another important point: Some students may use a note sheet anyway during the exam even if it is remote proctored. It would probably be best not to disadvantage students who would like to take the exam legitimately (like me)

   I'd rather be curved down on the average of my previous two exams than take an online final in this class

    Apparently there wonâ€™t be an online final and the staff are drafting an announcement email to everyone right now

     Perhaps we are going retro CS2110 style, with an optional final?

      I think that this is an equitable option given that I know many students don't currently have an environment suitable for taking an online exam. Those planning to leave for home tomorrow may also not have the proper resources.

       Worst case scenario would be it being rescheduled to after the break or after a lot of us have left
