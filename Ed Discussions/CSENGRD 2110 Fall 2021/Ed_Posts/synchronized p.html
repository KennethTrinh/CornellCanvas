  Oh yeah, it is there. Guess I never noticed it lol. You need not worry about it too much since you are not allowed to alter the code of that function.  But here is a definition of it that I found on the web.

 <paragraph>
  "
  <code>
   synchronized
  </code>
  methods enable a simple strategy for preventing thread interference and memory consistency errors: if an object is visible to more than one thread, all reads or writes to that object's variables are done through synchronized methods."
