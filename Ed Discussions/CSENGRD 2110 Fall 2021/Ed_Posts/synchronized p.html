   Oh yeah, it is there. Guess I never noticed it lol. You need not worry about it too much since you are not allowed to alter the code of that function.  But here is a definition of it that I found on the web.
  </p>
  <p>
   "
   <code>
    synchronized
   </code>
   methods enable a simple strategy for preventing thread interference and memory consistency errors: if an object is visible to more than one thread, all reads or writes to that object's variables are done through synchronized methods."
