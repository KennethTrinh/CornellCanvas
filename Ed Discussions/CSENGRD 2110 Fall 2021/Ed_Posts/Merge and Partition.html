 I know we need to know the algorithms for Quicksort and Mergesort, but I was wondering if we also need to know the algorithms for their helper methods, partition and merge, or if we just need to know the ideas behind these helper methods?

  You should know a partition algorithm and the implementation(which is on JHT). For mergesort's merge() algorithm, we only need to know what it does, but not the exact implementation.
