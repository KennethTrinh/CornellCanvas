 For #2, I got 3 and 5, but am wondering how you can get 4? Thank you!

  Do you know how to get "4" for question 1?  If so, the same applies to question 2.  One of the threads is not synchronized, so in the analogy, it ignores the "occupied" sign on the door and barges in through the broken latch.

  Synchronization is an opt-in, cooperative mechanism for preventing race conditions in critical sections of code.  If a thread doesn't cooperate, then no protection is provided.  This is why encapsulation is critical when writing data structures for safe concurrent use.

   so it would only be 3,5 if both processes were synchronized?

    What sequence of execution would yield 3 if both threads synchronized before incrementing the shared variable?

     Ohhh I think I understand. If both were synchronized, it would only be 5.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, if only one is synchronized is it basically this same as neither being synchronized?

      There is a distinction if you consider a hypothetical third thread, which could be synchronized.  But looking only at the two threads in this example, what you say is valid.
