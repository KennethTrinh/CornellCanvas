  Dear students,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  We have just heard that Cornell has moved to Alert Level Red and that our in-person final this afternoon at 2PM is canceled.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <italic>
   <bold>
    Note that ALL scheduled finals for CS2110 are canceled --the one in a quiet room, online ones, makeups, etc. Do not attempt to attend a scheduled 2110 final until we announce when it will be
   </bold>
  </italic>
  .
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Given the turmoil induced by this announcement, we will not attempt to move the final online this afternoon. Instead, an online final will be scheduled at a later date. This cancellation affects us all, for some of you, quite drastically. Therefore, we are making some substantial changes on how the final will be handled.

   <paragraph>
    We are making the final optional. We will compute a preliminary course grade for you and post it on CMS by Wednesday evening. You can accept that grade, and you don't have to take the final.
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    The performance of students who do take the final will not affect your accepted course grade.

   <paragraph>
    Taking the final can lower as well as well as raise your grade. In the past, when we experimented with an optional final, this did happen, though only for a few students.
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    Cornell is deciding when the new final will be scheduled. We have yet to determine the online format of the final (as it depends on staff availability), but we hope to decide that soon.
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    Those who opt to take the final but then cannot take it, for whatever reason, will receive an INComplete grade. This INC will be completed by taking an in-person final sometime during the Spring 2022 semester. We can't at this time specify the date (it may just be the final for next semesterâ€™s offering of the course).
   </paragraph>

  We are sorry for the significant stress that this outbreak has caused. Please stay safe, support one another, and be flexible as we try our best to provide a fair conclusion to this course.

  Your instructors,

  Does preliminary grade mean that is the grade we will definitely get in the course given that we do not take the final?

  Can we expect our computed final grades to match the total weighted score on CMSX right now?

  I was wondering if grades are determined according to the mean in cms or the median? Thanks!
