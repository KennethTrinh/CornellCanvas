 Why doesn't the call to E.m(-1, false) print 1 and then print an exception message because of the Arithmetic Exception on to the console. So, shouldn't an exception message also be part of the output?

  The first call does throw an Arithmetic Exception, but the question asked strictly what was printed by the println statements in the code. On the exam, the instructions will clarify this.
