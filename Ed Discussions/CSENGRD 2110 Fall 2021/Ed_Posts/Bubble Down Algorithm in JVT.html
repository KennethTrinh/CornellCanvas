 <paragraph>
  For this bubble down algorithm,
  <break>
  </break>
  I'm assuming int h is describing the parents position in the array, but what about int c? How is it that that is the smallest child of b[h]?  I didn't think the max-heap shared the same properties of a BST (i.e left is the smallest child and right is the largest child).
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I'm a bit confused about what's going on inside the while loop

  The comment
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  // c= larger child of h (return if h has no children)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  is implemented by the following three if-statements.
  <break>
  </break>
  1. h is set to the index left child.
  <break>
  </break>
  2. If h &gt; k-1, then h &gt; the index of the last element of the heap.
  <break>
  </break>
  No further bubbling needs to be done, so return.
  <break>
  </break>
  3. If the right child (as well as the left child) exists and its value if bigger
  <break>
  </break>
  than the value of the left child, set c to the index of the right child.

  You should be able to follow the rest.
