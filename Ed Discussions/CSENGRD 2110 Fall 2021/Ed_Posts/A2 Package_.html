 Do we need to create a new project for A2 and put both files in? My A2Test.java just couldn't run.

  For any assignment or homework that you do in Eclipse, ALWAYS start a new project for it and then copy the files into it.

 <p>
  What do you mean by "couldn't run? Did it compile?
 </p>

   Oh sorry I didn't copy it into the project. It works now. Thank you.
