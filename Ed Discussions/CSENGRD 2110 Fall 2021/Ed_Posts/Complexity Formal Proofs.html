 How formal do our proofs need to be? In the answer keys it has the &lt; &gt; notation with things like &lt;definition of f&gt; and &lt;arithmetic&gt;. Do we need things like this?

  As long as we can understand your proof, you don't need those. Those things within &lt;&gt; give explanations that make the proof easier to  understand.
