 Can we use the
 <code>
  break
 </code>
 statement in our loops for A8 or is it not allowed since it is not a good programming habit?

  I presume so since they do not check your code on A8 if your code is above 85% but I am not completely sure on that.  I used break in my code in try-catch statements.

   Do anything you want. We don't expect to look a code unless the grade is very low. And in that case, if we can't understand easily, we just won't look.
