  If you're given a maxheap in the form of an array and heapsorting it then does it matter if you decrement k after the swap or before? Does it matter since your largest value is always at position 0 and your smallest value is always at the last position of the array?

  What's
  <code>
   k
  </code>
  ? How it matters depends on the definition of
  <code>
   k
  </code>
  and the loop invariant.
