  In preparing for the final, I came across this statement: To make several instances of a class execute concurrently, it is sufficient to implement interface Runnable.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  My understanding after reading the Javadocs for Thread is that the class must also implement method run(). Is this understanding correct?

  Thank you!

  Interface Runnable has one abstract method, run().
  <break>
  </break>
  Therefore, if a class implements Runnable, it must override method run().
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thus, you are right; run() must be declared in the class.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  However, we don't have to mention it because if a class implements an interface, it must override all methods declared in that interface.

  One thing that might be confusing you is that, if you write a class containing instructions that you want to execute concurrently, and you decide to
  <italic>
   extend
  </italic>
  class
  <code>
   Thread
  </code>
  , then you must
  <italic>
   override
  </italic>
  <code>
   Thread
  </code>
  's
  <code>
   run()
  </code>
  method and put your instructions there.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  However, the more flexible way to do this is to write a class that implements
  <code>
   Runnable
  </code>
  , in which case the compiler will require you to override
  <code>
   run()
  </code>
  .  Then you can pass instances of that class to the constructor of generic
  <code>
   Thread
  </code>
  objects.
