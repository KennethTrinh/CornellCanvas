  In my copy of A2.java I have two specifications for loop5 the read the following:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  /** Any positive integer n can be written in this form: c*2^y, where &lt;br&gt;
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  * c is positive, c is odd, and y is greater than or equal to 0. &lt;br&gt;
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  * Return the value c. &lt;br&gt;
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  * Precondition: n &gt; 0 */
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  public static int loop5(int n) {
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  /*
  <bold>
   TODO
  </bold>
  13: Write a while-loop that continually divides n by 2
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  * until n is odd. Then return n.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  *
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  * Use  n%2 == 0  to test whether n is even.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Are these related in some way? If they are could anyone explain how?
