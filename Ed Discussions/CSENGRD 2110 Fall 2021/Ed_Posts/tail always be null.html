  This suggests that your implementation of
  <code>
   prepend()
  </code>
  is buggy or incomplete.  If you have not yet implemented
  <code>
   prepend()
  </code>
  , then you need to do that before you can make use of it in a test case.  If you have implemented it, then try "executing" your implementation with pencil and paper, drawing variable boxes for
  <code>
   DList
  </code>
  's fields and subdivided boxes for Nodes.  Is
  <code>
   tail
  </code>
  correctly maintained when you do this?

  Separately, look carefully at the arguments you are passing to
  <code>
   assertEquals()
  </code>
  .  What are their types?  If their (dynamic) types are not the same, can they ever be considered equal?
