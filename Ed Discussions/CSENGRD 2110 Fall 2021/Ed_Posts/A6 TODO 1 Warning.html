 After implementing TODO 1 got this warning but it still compiled and ran correctly. Should I be worried about this or just move on.
</p>
<p>
 Warning: the fonts "Times" and "Times" are not available for the Java logical font "Serif", which may have unexpected appearance or behavior. Re-enable the "Times" font to remove this warning.

  Hmmm. We haven't seen that. Could be specific to you operating system.
 </p>
 <p>
  Don't be concerned, as long as everything appears where it should. For example, did the score label appear?
