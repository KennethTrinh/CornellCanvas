  After implementing TODO 1 got this warning but it still compiled and ran correctly. Should I be worried about this or just move on.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Warning: the fonts "Times" and "Times" are not available for the Java logical font "Serif", which may have unexpected appearance or behavior. Re-enable the "Times" font to remove this warning.

  Hmmm. We haven't seen that. Could be specific to you operating system.

  Don't be concerned, as long as everything appears where it should. For example, did the score label appear?
