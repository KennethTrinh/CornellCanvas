  You will do better on these it you take the time to draw the objects.

  Second line: b is class B. Class b implements I2. Therefor, and upward cast, or coercion, from B to I2 will inserted.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Third line: This would require a cast from i1 to I2. that is not an upward cast, so it won't be inserted automatically, and this is illegal.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Fourth line: Here, the expression (I1) i1 has (static) type I1. So this is similar to the second line; a cast from I1 to I2 will not be inserted.

  So would i1 point to the same object as b? If so, wouldn't i1 be able to implement I2?

  It has nothing to do with that. Only upward casts are inserted when necessary, and a cast from i1 to i2 is not an upward cast. PLEASE draw an object of class b.
