 I'm curious why this function is not O(n^3)? If add() is O(n), and remove is O(i) where i goes from [0,n], and the outer loop runs n times, wouldn't the runtime be O(n^3)?
</p>
<p>
 Thank you in advance!

  The for loop will loop through n-1 elements, which is O(n).  Every element in the for loop will be treated with the list.add(0, list.remove(i)) line of code, which  is O(n).  Thus, n*n = n^2.  Therefore, this function takes O(n^2)

   But the solution key says list.remove(i) itself takes O(i), wouldn't that mean list.add(0, list.remove(i)) takes O(n^2)?

    The operations remove and add are sequential in this case. You first remove, which takes O(n) time, and then you add, which takes O(n) time. So list.add(0, list.remove(i)) takes O(n) time. Remember when you add, it's O(n) because prepending shifts all the elements down the array, but we're not removing an element each time we shift. We remove,

     then

    we add.

     Just to confirm I am understanding you correctly, you are saying list.add(0, list.remove(i)) technically takes f(n) = 2n time, which is thus bounded by O(n), instead of taking f(n) = n * n/2 time?

      Without getting into the formal proof, roughly yes.

     Sorry I am really tired I skimmed over your question quickly.  I believe O(i) means amortized time, which I think is technically constant time?  It depends on what i is.

     You could also see it as 2n, which would result in 2n^2.  That would still be O(n^2)
