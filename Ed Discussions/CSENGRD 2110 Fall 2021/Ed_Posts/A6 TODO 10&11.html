 After I move the sliders, I have to click on the dot once for the size and speed of the dot to be updated. Should the size and speed update instantaneously throughout the game, and if so how can I fix this?
</p>
<p>
 Thanks in advance!

  Yes, the size should update immediately when the slider is dragged, and the speed will change when the dot next respawns.  If you use the appropriate methods in
  <code>
   GameComponent
  </code>
  to change these settings, then you shouldn't need to do anything else for this to happen (those methods already call
  <code>
   repaint()
  </code>
  ).
