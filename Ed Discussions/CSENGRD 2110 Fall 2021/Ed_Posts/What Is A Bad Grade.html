 I did below average so obviously I will be changing my habits regardless of how below average my grade was.
</p>
<p>
 But, ballpark, what range of grades would be considered meet-with-the-professor-immediately, grades?
</p>
<p>
 And what range of grades would be considered study-more-work-harder, grades?
</p>
<p>
 Also, in general, what are these ranges in terms of standard deviation?
</p>
<p>
 Just doing damage control.

  Students scoring below ~35% are especially encouraged to meet with an instructor to ensure that they have a realistic plan for success in this course.

  Any student who is not satisfied with the level of comprehension of material indicated by their grade should take some time to reevaluate their study habits.  This can include meeting with the instructors or TAs, forming study groups, finding project partners with more comparable (rather than asymmetric) prior experience, and conducting more independent experimentation in Eclipse.  I know that most students already work and study extremely hard, so "study different" may be more productive, and both peers and staff can provide tips there.
