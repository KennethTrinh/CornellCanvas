  Is it possible to make a hashmap into a max heap, where the heap is sorted based on the value of the key in the hashmap, but the actual type of the nodes in the heap is of the item that is in the key of the hashmap? The key with the largest value will be stored in the root of the heap and so on. Or would another data structure work better for this?

  Iâ€™m trying to order the value for each coin based on their location on the map from greatest value to least, and then return the nodes that those coin values relate to so that I can move the diver to those nodes
