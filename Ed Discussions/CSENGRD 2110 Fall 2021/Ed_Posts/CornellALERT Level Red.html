  So I just got an email from CornellALERT saying that "Ithaca campus moving to alert level red". Does this change anything in terms of taking the final?

  This part of the email is very concerning: “ In addition, the university’s COVID-19 testing lab team identified preliminary evidence of the highly contagious Omicron variant in a significant number of Monday’s positive student samples.”

  Even with extraordinary concern, I don't know if it is too late for CS to cancel the in-person exam?

  I agree. I am very concerned about taking the test in person, in addition to the mental stress the uptick in COVID cases has caused.

  We are communicating with administrators now to understand the academic implications of this announcement (history suggests a clarification message will be coming shortly).  Your instructors do have a "Plan B" if the university determines that the risk of taking exams or of a continued student presence on campus is too high.  We will make an announcement to the class as soon as we have confirmation one way or the other.
