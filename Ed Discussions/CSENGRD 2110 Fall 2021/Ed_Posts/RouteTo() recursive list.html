 I have read the other posts about this but I am still confused on how we can complete H1N1RouteTo() if the linked list is created in the base case. If I assign a list variable to the recursive call then I need to cast to a linked list anyways to make sure everything is being added in the correct order, which doesn't seem correct.

<p>
 I think I am misunderstanding something fundamental

  You do not need to cast a list into a linked list for your recursive case.  Anyways, you can not convert from List to LinkedList.  I just tried in eclipse and got an error.

   In the recursive case, assign what the recursive call gives you to a variable of type List&lt;Person&gt;.
  </p>

   That is fine.

   If that variable is not null, you indeed have a List&lt;Person&gt;, and you may want to prepend something to it. Look throw the methods of interface List to see how you could do this.
