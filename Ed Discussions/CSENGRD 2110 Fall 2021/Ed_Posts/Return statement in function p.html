 Hi, the comment for this function(the 6th one) says that it should return using a return statement even though it is void. And if I add an empty return statement, the moment I save it, it disappears. Is this an error with the comment or am I understanding this part incorrectly?

  Within a procedure. -a method with return type  void , use the statement
 </p>
 <p>
  return;
 </p>
 <p>
  to terminate execution. There is no expression.

  You could have found this out in two seconds by typing     return    into the JavaHyperText Filter Field!  That would have save you time. Get in the habit of looking at JavaHyperText first.
