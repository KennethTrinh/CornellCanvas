 I see different instructions for testing toStringR.
</p>
<p>
 In the a4 pdf:

<p>
 So, am I supposed to create test procedures for both append and prepend and use toStringR in both?

  They are not contradictory. Do what makes sense:
 </p>
 <p>
  1. toStringR has to be tested. But it can't be tested until you can create nonempty lists. So, test Prepend and toStringR together, in ONE testing procedure with @Test before it.
 </p>
 <p>
  In A1, you wrote one testing procedure for the first constructor. To get at the fields, it had to use the observer functions. So, as a byproduct of testing the first constructor, you also tested the observer functions.
 </p>
 <p>
  In A4, you write one testing procedure for prepend. Aa a byproduct, it also tests toStringR.

   Oh I see. So, I am supposed to test toStringR in both prepend and append which will be their own test procedures? Also, I saw in the A4 pdf you had testConstructor and tested toStringR there as well. Am I supposed to test the Constructor in its own test procedure for other things too like the fields?
