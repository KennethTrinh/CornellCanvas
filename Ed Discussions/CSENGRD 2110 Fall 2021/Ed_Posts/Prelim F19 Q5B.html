 For this answer on the F19 Prelim 7:30 exam, I'm a little confused on what the red line of code does, as the value idx is not used anywhere else after this. It's also not assigning a value to idx, so I'm not really seeing the purpose of this line of code. Any help would be appreciated, thanks!

  TODO 2 is asking you to write out the invariant, so this idx is basically k. What the invariant is saying is that we need to make sure those elements that already got iterated through will not appear, and those elements that are located in index larger than k/idx will get iterated or will get return by next().
