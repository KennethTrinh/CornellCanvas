 If we want to get the value of the field, can't we just say "return &lt;class&gt;.&lt;field&gt;;
</p>
<p>
 If we want to set or change the value of the field, can't we just say "&lt;class&gt;.&lt;field&gt; = new value"?
</p>

 I've looked at hypertext and it explains what getters/setters do and I understand that. I just don't understand why we'd bother creating these functions when we can get access to them or change them using other ways

  If the field is private, you can't reference directly outside the class.
