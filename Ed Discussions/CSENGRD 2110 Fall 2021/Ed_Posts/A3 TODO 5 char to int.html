  I got stuck at converting a
  <code>
   char
  </code>
  that is an integer to an
  <code>
   int
  </code>
  , but managed to do it two different ways:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1. One way was to use a method from the
  <code>
   Integer
  </code>
  object to convert, but this goes against the rule "Rely only on methods of class String"
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. Another way was to manipulate the integer by subtracting '0' from the
  <code>
   (char) int
  </code>
  but I'm not sure if this counts as breaking the rule "Do not use magic numbers."
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Is one, both, or none of these methods of converting a
  <code>
   char
  </code>
  to an
  <code>
   int
  </code>
  valid for this assignment? Thanks.

  Did you look at JavaHyperText and type   char   into the Filter Field?

  There, you see this:

  This
  <link href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/JavaAndDS/files/char.pdf"/>
  pdf file explains type

  and the unicode representation of characters. That link is to

  READ that pdf file, especially the section titled "Casting to and from a characterâ€™s code point".

  Please, use JavaHyperText. It is your course textbook
