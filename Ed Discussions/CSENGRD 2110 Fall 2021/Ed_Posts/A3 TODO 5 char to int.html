 I got stuck at converting a
 <code>
  char
 </code>
 that is an integer to an
 <code>
  int
 </code>
 , but managed to do it two different ways:
</p>
<p>
 1. One way was to use a method from the
 <code>
  Integer
 </code>
 object to convert, but this goes against the rule "Rely only on methods of class String"
</p>
<p>
 2. Another way was to manipulate the integer by subtracting '0' from the
 <code>
  (char) int
 </code>
 but I'm not sure if this counts as breaking the rule "Do not use magic numbers."
</p>
<p>
 Is one, both, or none of these methods of converting a
 <code>
  char
 </code>
 to an
 <code>
  int
 </code>
 valid for this assignment? Thanks.

  This goes back to the first lecture!
 </p>
 <p>
  Did you look at JavaHyperText and type   char   into the Filter Field?
 </p>
 <p>
  There, you see this:
 </p>
 <p>
  This
  <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/JavaAndDS/files/char.pdf">
   pdf file
   explains type
   <b>
    char
   </b>
   and the unicode representation of characters. That link is to

 </p>
 <p>
  READ that pdf file, especially the section titled "Casting to and from a characterâ€™s code point".
 </p>
 <p>
  Please, use JavaHyperText. It is your course textbook
