 This question is from a past prelim "If a graph has a thousand vertices, each having at most 5 neighbors, you should implement the graph using an adjacency matrix instead of a adjacency list."
</p>
<p>
 The answer for this question is "False."
</p>
<p>
 I thought it would be true since this would be a large graph, and using an adjacency matrix would be better as you can find an edge between two nodes in O(1) while it would be O(n^2) for this dense graph.

  You misunderstand the word "dense".
  <break>
  </break>
  Type     dense       into JavaHyperText and you get what you see below.
  <break>
  </break>
  Please study this.

  A graph is
  <i>
   dense
  </i>
  if the number of edges is close to the maximum. A graph is
  <i>
   sparse
  </i>
  if the number of edges is close to the minimum.
  <break>
  </break>
  These terms are not well defined in the literature. So we use these definitions:
  <break>
  </break>
  A graph with n nodes is
  <i>
   dense
  </i>
  if the number of edges is proportional to n*n; it is
  <i>
   sparse
  </i>
  if the number of edges is O(n).
  <break>
  </break>
  A map of a city is generally a sparse graph because the number of edges leaving each intersection is generally 4 or less.

   Suppose there are n vertices. How many edges are there? At most 5n.
  </p>
  <p>
   Therefore, the adjacency list implementation requires only space O(n) (for the vertices) plus O(5n), which is a total of O(n).
  </p>
  <p>
   But the adjacency matrix representation requires space O(n*n).
  </p>
  <p>
   Further, many operations, like processing the nodes adjacent to a particular node, requires constant time --at most 5 nodes have to be processed. But to even find the nodes adjacent to a particular node with the adjacency matrix implementation requires time O(n) to find those nodes.

    This screenshot is from Java HyperText.  I thought the graph for this problem would be a "dense" graph) since there are an enormous amount of vertices and each having 5 neighbors.  How can you tell between a "dense" and a "sparse" graph?
