 The following was sent by email to all CS2110 students from the CMS yesterday, Sunday, 12 December, at about 12:40PM. It appears that not all students saw this email, so we are repeating it here:

 Hello CS 2110 students,

 We know many of you have questions about final exam logistics and whether anything has changed with the university's move to Alert Level yellow.  As announced in the provost's message, "in-person exams will continue as planned, as there has been no evidence of classroom virus transmission."  And Barton Hall is among the safest group exam spaces on campus.  Still, there are a couple of details and reminders we'd like to share with you.

 If you are in QUARANTINE, or if you are SYMPTOMATIC and awaiting test results from Cornell Health, we will remotely proctor your exam.  Please e-mail our course admin, Corey Torres (ct635), so we can communicate the procedures (we are also monitoring official SDS notices).  You will need a computer, blank paper, and a second Zoom-capable device with a scanning app.  Your exam will still start at 2pm on Tuesday if you are healthy enough to take it.

 If you have SDS authorization for additional time on the exam, your exam will still start at 2pm in Barton Hall.  If you additionally have SDS authorization for a reduced-distraction testing location, your exam will take place in Gates 122 instead (still starting at 2pm); you will receive an e-mail from Corey on Monday confirming this room.

 Most of you will take the exam in Barton Hall, which is a large, high-ceiling space where you can work socially-distanced from one another (only 1 or 2 students per table).  We are in the CENTER and EAST sections (4 sections total); do not sit in the west section unless you want to take a statistics exam instead.  When you enter the field house, please find a seat _quickly_ and sit down.

 The semester is not yet over, and you MUST continue to abide by Cornell's public health requirements: wear masks, stick to your surveillance testing schedule, and contact Cornell Health if you exhibit symptoms indicative of COVID-19.  We know we can keep each other and our communities safe by following these simple protocols; let's keep it up here for a few more days.
