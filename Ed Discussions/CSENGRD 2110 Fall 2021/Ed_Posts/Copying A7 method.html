 When I copy my djikstra method from A7.java in the a7 file to A7.java in the a8 file, it does not work properly. It does not highlight properly and I think it copies the imports from the original a7 file. I'm not sure how to address this problem.

 Thank you.

  We'll have to see more. Please post some code.

  You CAN do this differently. In A7, the only difference is the short-path method. Try copying your method from your solution into the A7.java that is already there with that method subbed in.
