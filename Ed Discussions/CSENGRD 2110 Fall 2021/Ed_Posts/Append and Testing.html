  When testing getNode, I want to append 10 nodes so I can test different positions of the node.  I know on the bottom of the A4 PDF it says that you must test
  <italic>
   every
  </italic>
  method call that changes the linked list.  So, if I want to append 10 nodes, does that mean I need to write 30 assertEquals expressions, or can I just use  3 at the end to test the final appended string, reversed string, and size?

  If you are testing getNode, that means that prepend and append are already tested and working.

  Therefore, in testing getNode, you don't need ANY tests for append and prepend.

  To require testing of append and prepend when testing getNode makes no sense.
