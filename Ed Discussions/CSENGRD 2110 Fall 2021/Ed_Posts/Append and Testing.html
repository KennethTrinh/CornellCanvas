 When testing getNode, I want to append 10 nodes so I can test different positions of the node.  I know on the bottom of the A4 PDF it says that you must test
 <i>
  every
 </i>
 method call that changes the linked list.  So, if I want to append 10 nodes, does that mean I need to write 30 assertEquals expressions, or can I just use  3 at the end to test the final appended string, reversed string, and size?
</p>

  If you are testing getNode, that means that prepend and append are already tested and working.
 </p>
 <p>
  Therefore, in testing getNode, you don't need ANY tests for append and prepend.

  To require testing of append and prepend when testing getNode makes no sense.
