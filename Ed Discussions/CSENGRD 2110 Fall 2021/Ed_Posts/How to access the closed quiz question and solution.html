  Which quiz are you referring to? We've just updated Canvas Quiz: Lec 11..14, so you should be able to see the correct answers for that quiz now.

  I could only see a line that says "Answers will be shown after your last attempt" for quiz: lec 11...14,  I just used 2 attempts but it's closed now, so I don't think I am able to submit the last attempt to see the answer. And I skipped the former quizzes (I chose Audit for this course), for those quizzes I skipped, I could only see that it is closed and I am really confused about how can I access them.

  Canvas Quiz: Lec 11..14 has been updated so that the answers should be displayed even if you did not use up all your attempts. The other quizzes have a similar setting, so I am not sure why you're unable to access them. It might be because you did not complete them?

  I have one complete attempt for Quiz:Lec11..14 but not for others. Is there any way for me to access them? Currently I am accessing by canvas -&gt; quizzes module -&gt; clicking into each quiz. I don't know whether I am accessing the right place

  I'm sorry, unfortunately with the current state of Canvas, if you did not complete a quiz you are unable to see the answers.
