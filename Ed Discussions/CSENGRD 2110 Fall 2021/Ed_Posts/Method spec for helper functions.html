 How do we write a method spec for the helper function? Will it  not be the same spec as the method its helping?

  Is this for the seek phase?
 </p>
 <p>
  No, it needs a different spec. Please follow the guidelines in Ed Discussion Note #1121 on the seek phase.
 </p>
 <p>
  For the scram phase, if McDiver is just getting out as quickly as possible, not much is needed.
 </p>
 <p>
  If McDiver is going to look around and get more gold, you will want to write something in the spec and have comments to help anyone reading it to understand the strategy.

  If your submission always succeeds and gets &gt;= 85, then no one will look at it.
 </p>
 <p>
  If your submission get a low score and someone looks at it to see whether more points should be given, if things are not suitably documented they will not look at it.
