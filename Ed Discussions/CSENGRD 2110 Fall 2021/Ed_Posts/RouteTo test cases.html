 I'm a little bit confused about the expected outcome of the function.
</p>
<p>
 When I use "[A,B]" as the outcome it will throw an error and if I use "[A, B]" (add a space) instead it passes. Are there suppose to have spaces between each node? Thanks in advance!

  This you should have been able to find out with just a little bit of thought and searching.
 </p>
 <p>
  Look at class H1N1TreeTest and down torpocedure test6H1N1RouteTo.
 </p>
 <p>
  You see many calls on getNames. Hover your mouse over one of them, and the specification of that method should pop up. Read it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Another way to it. Just search for method getNames and read its specification
