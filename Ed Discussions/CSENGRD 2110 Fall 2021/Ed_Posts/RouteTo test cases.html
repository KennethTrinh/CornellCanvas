  I'm a little bit confused about the expected outcome of the function.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  When I use "[A,B]" as the outcome it will throw an error and if I use "[A, B]" (add a space) instead it passes. Are there suppose to have spaces between each node? Thanks in advance!

  This you should have been able to find out with just a little bit of thought and searching.

  Look at class H1N1TreeTest and down torpocedure test6H1N1RouteTo.

  You see many calls on getNames. Hover your mouse over one of them, and the specification of that method should pop up. Read it.

  Another way to it. Just search for method getNames and read its specification
