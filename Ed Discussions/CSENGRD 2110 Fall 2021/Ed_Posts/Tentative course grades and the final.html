  The following was emailed through the CMS to all students and staff of CS2110. We copy it here in case some students did not see that email:

 <paragraph>
  ==============
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <italic>
   PLEASE READ THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY BEFORE YOU POST OR EMAIL QUESTIONS ABOUT FINAL GRADES! We know you are inquisitive, but we really need to focus on adapting the final exam; answers to all your relevant questions should be found within.
  </italic>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  In a few minutes we will release the tentative Course Grades on the CMS. On your CMS home page, look near the top and click "SHOW Final Grade:". If it does not show a grade, then you have to take the final because you missed a prelim.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  There is a survey on Canvas for you to fill out to say whether you accept the tentative grade (which will become your course grade) or whether you will take the final; it is called "
  <link href="https://canvas.cornell.edu/courses/29519/quizzes/77357"/>
  Accept Course Grade". Complete the survey before midnight on Saturday, December 18, so we know how many exams to prepare.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  We'll say it again because students have asked in the past: if you accept the tentative course grade, that IS your course grade. How others do on the final will not affect your grade.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The online final is scheduled for Tuesday, December 21, at 2PM. If you have a valid conflict on that date, we
  <italic>
   may
  </italic>
  be able to schedule one makeup opportunity. If you choose to take the final but cannot take it on the 21st or on the potential makeup date for a valid reason, then you will receive an INComplete grade for our course and will take the final sometime during the Spring 2022 semester (we do not know when).
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Once you start taking the final, you must finish; you may not decide not to take it after seeing it. Taking the final may raise or lower your grade. (The latter doesn't happen often, but it does happen.)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Please read the "
  <link href="https://canvas.cornell.edu/courses/29519/pages/grading-notes"/>
  Notes on grades" Canvas page about how grades are calculated.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Statistics on grades
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Below, we give statistics on tentative course grades:
 </paragraph>
 <list style="unordered">
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    A-, A, and A+: 33%
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    B-, B, and B+: 43%
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    C-, C, and C+: 21%
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
 </list>
 <paragraph>
  We cannot entertain emails (although our replies may be entertaining) that say your tentative grade should be higher because you did better on assignments or that YOU calculated the total and, based on that, you believe the course grade should be higher. We believe the statistics show that we have assigned grades fairly and "leniently". We have also taken into account unique circumstances affecting individual students; to us, you are not a number but a person.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Finally, we cannot answer individual questions about how high your grade on the final has to be to give you a higher course grade, or where the grade cutoffs will be. We just can't tell. (But it is reasonable to assume that, in order to raise your course grade, you must perform better than you did on the prelims.)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Grade information
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  We give information below that lets you see roughly where you lie in your grade range. We do not publish “cutoffs,” as we consider your performance holistically - especially near grade boundaries. Instead, we share the median total score in each grade range. These are not percentages, but are instead comparable to the “Total Weighted Score” you can see in CMS. (Your tentative grade takes more into account, including dropping your lowest Canvas quiz and extrapolating your exam scores, but these operations are not supported by CMS; for most students, the results correlate well with the CMS total.)
 </paragraph>
 <list style="unordered">
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    The highest A+ has a total score of 73.1.
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    The median A (content A-, A, and A+) has a total score of 69.2. Half the As have a lower total score, the other half a higher total score.
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    The median B has a total score of 63.8.
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    The median C has a total score of 56.9.
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
 </list>
 <paragraph>
  About the Final
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If you take the final, it will count for 26% of your total score (unless you missed a prelim, in which case it is worth proportionally more). The exam is timed, with a style similar to past in-person finals, but its questions will be adapted for the online setting.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The distribution of scores on the final exam will be affected by a strong selection bias. For example, most students whose Tentative Grade is an A will not take the final. Thus, we expect the mean and median on the final to be much lower than typical. We recognize this when interpreting exam statistics, so do not count on the final exam scores being "curved".
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  That is all we have to say for now. Please look at your tentative grade and fill out the Accept Course Grade survey ASAP. Safe travels,
