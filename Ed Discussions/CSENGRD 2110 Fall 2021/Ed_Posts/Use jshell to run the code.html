 How do I use jshell to run the code I'm writing like in the class we run Fraction1, etc.? What is that command?

  The command demonstrated in lecture was
  <code>
   /open
  </code>
  ; it takes one argument, a filename (like "Fraction1.java"), and it acts as if you had copy-pasted the entire contents of the file into the terminal.

 <p>
  JShell can also make use of pre-compiled Java classes and libraries (".class" files) as long as they are on the "classpath."  However, it does not support classes in the "default package," so you must put code in a package for this to work (this is why all assignment code is in a package named after the assignment).  This is a more advanced, but more flexible, way of working.

   Please type jshell into the JavaHyperText Filter Field.
  </p>
  <p>
   You will get a pdf file with instructions on using jshell.
