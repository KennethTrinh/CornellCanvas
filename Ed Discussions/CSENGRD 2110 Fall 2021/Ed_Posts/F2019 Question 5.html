 Hi!
</p>
<p>
 I was wondering why is this graph not planar? I don't think it contains K33 or K55.

  Yeah, it's a rearranged K33 + 2 extra nodes on the end I believe, what Derek said. I see it by looking at the two groups consisting of three nodes that don't point to each other and instead point to the other three nodes from the opposite group. Like if you're looking at the nodes of the hexagon, it's every other node that's part of a group. Not sure if there's a better way to describe it though.

    Wait what does K33 mean and where did we learn that?

     If a graph contains K33 or K5 graphs that makes it nonplanar. Here's a picture of what they look like:

     .

    <p>
     K5 is a graph with 5 nodes and all of them are connected to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
     K33 is a bipartite graph with each node from one group of 3 connecting to all three nodes from the other group.

   If you move the nodes around a bit, you could see it contains K33 + 2 extra nodes, though I think it's much more convenient to just try to draw the plane without any edges crossing, and observe that it is impossible.
