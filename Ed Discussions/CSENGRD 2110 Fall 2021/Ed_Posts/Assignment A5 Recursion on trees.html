  0. Typo in describing test on depth
 </b>
 . About line 108, it should be:
</p>
<p>
 assertEquals(depths[k], a suitable call on depth, for you to do);
</p>

  1. Studying and using the two patterns
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 In the two videos we asked you to read and study, two patterns were described:
</p>
<list style="ordered">
 <li>
  <p>
   Count the nodes with a property.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Find one node with a property.
  </p>
 </li>
</list>
<p>
 In the past, on similar assignments, some of the methods we are asked to look at on the course Ed Discussion did not show the structure of either of these. And of course they don't work. We ask that you do the following:
</p>
<list style="bullet">
 <li>
  <p>
   Study those two videos and learn those two patterns!
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Note that the return type of a method has
   <i>
    nothing
   </i>
   to do with determining what kind of pattern your method needs.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   When writing a recursive A5 method, identity for yourself which of the two patterns is to be used and follow that pattern!
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   When you show us a method on the course Ed Discussion that is not working and you ask for help, tell us which of the two patterns you were trying to use on this method.
  </p>
 </li>
</list>
<p>
 Doing this will help YOU as you develop the methods, and it will help the staff respond more quickly to your questions.
