  for insertAfter, there is a precondition that "n must be a node of this list". How can we assert this without looping through the list and checking each node against n, as that would no longer be constant time? Thanks

  There is no requirement in this assignment that Preconditions be checked using assert statements.

  Use your own judgment on this. We will not deduct points because assert statements were not used.
