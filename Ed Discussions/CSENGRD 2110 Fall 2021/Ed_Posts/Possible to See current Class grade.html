  Yes, you can see them now. It's been always available.
 </p>
 <p>
  When you get on the CMS, look at the body for a red "Show Grades".
 </p>
 <p>
  Let us know if you have problems seeing this.
 </p>
 <p>
  That being said, there are a few things to remember.
  <break>
  </break>
  1. Not everything has been graded or moved from Canvas to the CMS
  <break>
  </break>
  2. The total score at the moment includes all Canvas Quizzes; for the final calculation, the lowest one will be dropped.
