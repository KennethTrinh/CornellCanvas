 Is there a exam conflict form to submit for this class if we have another final exam scheduled at the same time or three final exams in one day?

   If you have a conflict or have 3 exams in 24 hours, then you should fill out the future CS final conflict survey.  Also you should fill it out if you have SDS accommodations.
