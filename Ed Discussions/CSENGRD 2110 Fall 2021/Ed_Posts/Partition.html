 What does a partition of a class really mean? I can't seem to find a definition on JavaHyperText's pdf that matches what test questions seem to be asking for. In other words, how can I determine the partition of a given class? Thank you.

  I typed    partition   into the JavaHyperText Filter Field and got two entries.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first was:  partition, of an object
 </p>
 <p>
  That entry has a link to a pdf file. Below is the link. Read that whole pdf file carefully.
