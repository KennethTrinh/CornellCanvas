 <paragraph>
  from reading the spec for equals() it seems like this and ob could have children in different positions (at least horizontally)? is this accurate interpretation?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  i think this because the method isIn() only looks if 2 trees have the same children anywhere in the set of children, rather than in the same place within their sets.

  We defined the children of a node as a SET.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Therefore, there is no idea of "position", or "ordering".
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Had we defined the children of a node as a LIST, then there would be an ordering.
