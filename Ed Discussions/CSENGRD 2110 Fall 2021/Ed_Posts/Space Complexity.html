  Is the space used to store any output such as an array considered in the big O notation space analysis?

  Yes.

  Consider insertion sort. An array is used to hold the values to be sorted, but it is not extra space used in sorting. Insertion sort uses only a few local variables, and its space requirement is O(1).

  Consider merge sort. An array is used to hold the values to be sorted, but it is not extra space used in sorting. However, during the linear-time merge operation, half the values are moved to another array. This IS extra space, so to sort to sort an array of size n, merge sort requires O(n) extra space.
