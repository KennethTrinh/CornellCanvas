 How do we test for the preconditions and error cases in the methods?
</p>
<p>
 I have tried writing anonymous classes for the method on insert, for example, and using assertThrows for the IllegalArgumentException.class but it is not working. Same for NullPointerExceptions. Is there something syntactically wrong with writing test cases like this or is there a different method for testing these cases all together?

  You do not have to do that if you do not want to.

  Save yourself some time.
