  Prepare for the final as usual.

  We will probably have an online option for those who are in isolation.

  We'll probably send out a notice tomorrow (Sunday).

  If the online option isn't available to everyone, wouldn't that give an unfair advantage to those who are in isolation? If the option is available to some, shouldn't it be available to all because taking it online has the advantages of notes?

  CS 1110 had online prelims last semester but were proctored on zoom and you couldn't use notes

  I still feel like it would give a substantial advantage, the fact alone that you're able to take it isolated in a more relaxed setting. Also a bit nervous about covid transmission in a large room with a bunch of students (not nervous about myself, but my mom is immunocompromised).

  No I totally feel you, Omicron (more infectious than delta) got detected in Tompkins County and I will be meeting my at-risk parents when I leave for Winter break

  I assume online exams would be very strictly proctored and closed-book, just like in person exams, though there would be an advantage in that students who take it online might be in a less stressful setting (their own home)
