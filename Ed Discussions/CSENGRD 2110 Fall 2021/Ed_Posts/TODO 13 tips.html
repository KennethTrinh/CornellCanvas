  I'm having trouble figuring out how to change the font size of the title for the new panel. I checked out setFont for TitleBorder, but it looks like I can only set the title and not update the size.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Also, do we need to split the title at the newline to get "size" and "speed" separately?
 </paragraph>

  Thanks

  Size is for one slider, speed for the other. Handle them separately.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  To figure out to change the don size for a panel, look around in the already written code for something similar.

  Use whatever font is already being used, just change the point size.
