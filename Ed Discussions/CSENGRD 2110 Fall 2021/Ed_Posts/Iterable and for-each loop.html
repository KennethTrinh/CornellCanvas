  I am a little confused as to why this is true? Wouldn't we still be able to use a for-each statement on objects that do not implement Iterable, for example ints of int[], chars of String, etc.

  Consider your assignment on LinkedLists. You could not initially use a foreach loop to enumerate its elements. But once interface Iterable is implemented in that class, the foreach loop could be used.

  One cannot use a foreach statement over chars in the String because String does not implement interface Iterable.
