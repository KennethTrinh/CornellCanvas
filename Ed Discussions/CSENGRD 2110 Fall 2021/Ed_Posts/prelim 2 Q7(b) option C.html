  Sorry, we don't have time to look for that question. Put it here if you want your question answered. For "anonymous class", look it up in JavaHyperText. That's easier than giving a long explanation here. I will say this:
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as Java now allows functions without a name --anonymous functions-- Java also has classes without a name --anonymous classes.
 </p>

    Aah, thanks for putting in that question. Now I understand.
   </p>
   <p>
    Anonymous classes were mentioned in the recitation on anonymous functions as well as, very briefly, in the lectures on GUIs.
   </p>
   <p>
    In order to add a listener to something like a button or an event like moving a mouse, as in this question, you have to give the add-listener method (e.g. addMouseMotionListener) an object that contains the methods required by an interface (e.g. MouseMotionListener). This can be a bit awkward, to declare a class just for that purpose.
   </p>
   <p>
    To make it easier, Java has what is called an anonymous class, which you can give as the argument. This is not a good place to explain the anonymous class. Please look it up in JavaHyperText.
   </p>
   <p>
    For this question, even if you did not know what an anonymous class is, you could have guessed that  C  was a correct answer. All three answers A, B, C mention "implementing or extending MouseMotionListener". That was the clue to use.
