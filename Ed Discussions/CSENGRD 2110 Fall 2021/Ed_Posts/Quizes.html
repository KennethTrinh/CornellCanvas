 Hello,
</p>
<p>
 Just a little confused on when the quizes are due. Is there one due on Friday and one due on Sunday? Thank you for clarifying.

  2. A1 is due Saturday night.
 </p>

  3. A SHORT quiz (4 questions) on program correctness is due Monday night by midnight. It will be released Sunday afternoon.
