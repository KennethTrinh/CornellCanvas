 Hello,
</p>
<p>
 Are we supposed to receive an email if we have accommodations for extended time?
</p>
<p>
 Thanks.

  If you have accommodations for extended time but not for a reduced-distraction testing location, then you should not expect to receive an e-mail.  Your exam will begin at 2pm in Barton Hall.
