 I used e.getXOnScreen() - getX() to get cx and e.getYOnScreen() - getY() to get cy. While cx accurately captures the mouse event position, cy constantly deviates downward by 60 px. Can anyone figure out the reason?

  I had a similar problem- there is a method getX() in MouseEvent which helped me.
