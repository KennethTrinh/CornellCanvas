  Dear Professors, TAs, and All,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I hope you are safe during this particularly difficult time; the combination of finals, the Omicron variant, and volatile plans to get home, have amounted to uncertainty and immense stress.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  We have seen 214 new positive cases yesterday, totaling 469 cases, according to the school's COVID-19 Tracking dashboard. Despite the high vaccination rate, we are experiencing a 3% rate over the week, and 7% over the last two days. It is understood that Balch Hall, as well as hotels, are at our nearing their capacity. According to the dashboard, Red Zone (High Risk) is "significant increase in incidence with limited quarantine, isolation and/or local hospital capacity."
 </paragraph>

  I know many peers who are leaving early to protect themselves and their family members. At this point, many of us know of at least one friend who was contact traced. As advised by Housing Residential Life, newly positive students are now being instructed to isolate themselves in their rooms - an unideal situation for any suite/floor member. Clearly, the situation has dramatically worsened.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Many students have the opportunity to take their exams online, or not at all. This allows them the flexibility to safely return home without having to remain on campus a moment longer.
 </paragraph>

  Respectfully, I am wondering what the plan for tomorrow's exam will be. There are over 350 students in this class, and I, as well as others I am sure, do not feel comfortable spending hours in the same hall, no matter the "precautions" put into place.

  I would also like to add that a new variant, the Omicron Variant, has been detected in Tompkins County and on-campus.  This variant has been proving to be more infectious than the Delta Strain, and I will be extremely anxious taking my exam tomorrow because there is very little data on how Omicron can spread despite everyone being socially distanced and wearing masks.  I will be going home to my at-risk parents who both do not have health insurance, and I am very worried about them.  If one of them gets COVID, my life will be extremely difficult over the winter.  I also come from a poor family, and any I cannot afford any sudden changes in my travel plans for the winter.  All my other classes made changes to their final exams in order to preserve student health; for instance, my math final was made optional the evening before the exam.  I hope that our honorable Professors understand the current struggles and anxiety we are facing in these uncertain times before a lot of us leave for home during winter break.

  I agree as someone who is personally immunocompromised and is traveling home to a family who is also immunocompromised, I feel uneasy about sitting in an exam with people who are told to attend despite being close contacts of infected individuals. (Let alone people who aren't even scheduled for surveillance tests until after this exam and may be carrying it asymptomatic).
