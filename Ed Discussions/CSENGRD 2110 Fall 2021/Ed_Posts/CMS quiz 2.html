 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 I was just going over the three week schedule and it appears that we are scheduled to have a CMS quiz on program correctness due next monday. I just wanted to check to see if the current CMS quiz due tonight was mistakenly posted with a due date a week too early?
</p>
<p>
 Thanks!
</p>

  No, it is correct. Look at the 3-week schedule. It shows that the CMS quiz on program correctness is due tonight. It is a short, 4-question quiz designed to inspire you to do the tutorial on program correctness before section tomorrow and Wednesday. The tutorial was announced last Friday. It is still on the 3-week schedule.
