  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I was just going over the three week schedule and it appears that we are scheduled to have a CMS quiz on program correctness due next monday. I just wanted to check to see if the current CMS quiz due tonight was mistakenly posted with a due date a week too early?

  Thanks!

  No, it is correct. Look at the 3-week schedule. It shows that the CMS quiz on program correctness is due tonight. It is a short, 4-question quiz designed to inspire you to do the tutorial on program correctness before section tomorrow and Wednesday. The tutorial was announced last Friday. It is still on the 3-week schedule.
