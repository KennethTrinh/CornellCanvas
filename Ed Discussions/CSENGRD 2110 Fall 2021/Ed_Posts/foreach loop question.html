<p>
 if I have a foreach loop : for(H1N1 Tree dt : children){...}, what happens when the node doesn't have any children? My guess is that it would look like for(H1N1 Tree dt : null) and so it would just skip over the loop entirely. is this correct?

  There is a difference between an empty list and
  <code>
   null
  </code>
  .  If the list object exists, but its size is zero, then the loop body will execute 0 time and move on.  However, if the list object itself is
  <code>
   null
  </code>
  , then a
  <code>
   NullPointerException
  </code>
  will be thrown.
