  I understand what the first four invariants are saying based on the reading, but I'm a little confused by the wording of the fifth invariant. Is it saying that for each node, there is an equal number of null descendant nodes as black nodes?

  Red-Black trees are not in scope for this class nor will they be tested in the exam. They are covered in CS 3110

  Part 5 of the invariant means that, if you start at any node in the tree (e.g., consider only the subtree rooted at that node), then every path from that node down to a leaf in the tree will contain the same number of black nodes.  For example, the path from "A" to "C" might contain two node, both of which are black; then, if the path from "A" to "D" were to contain three nodes, one of them would have to be red so that the number of black nodes along that path is the same as the number of black nodes from "A" to "C".

  Red-black trees are a very interesting data structure, but they are no longer part of the CS 2110 syllabus; you can learn more about them in CS 3110.
