 After completing todo 8, my game stops after 3-4 targets are clicked, or 7.5 seconds, whichever comes first. Isn't the game intended to run for 15 seconds? If so, is this an issue in my code?

  The game should stop after displaying 10 targets, which, at the default speed setting, should take 15 seconds.  If fewer than 10 targets are shown (regardless of how many are clicked), then there is an issue with your code.
