   If you see stray lines in the figures, please use another PDF viewer. Adobe Reader, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Apple Preview are all known to render these graphs correctly.

   Question 2. Loop invariants. The two arrays being used are already declared and created. Do not attempt to create them.
  </p>
 </li>

   Question 3, part c: If your exam mentions an array
   <code>
    d[0..6]
   </code>
   , then says "Initially,
   <code>
    b
   </code>
   contains no elements", then says "Draw array
   <code>
    d
   </code>
   ", those should all refer to the same array
   <code>
    d
   </code>
   (so the
   <code>
    b
   </code>
   in the middle sentence is a typo).
  </p>

   Question 7, part a: If your exam mentions lists
   <code>
    listX
   </code>
   and
   <code>
    listY
   </code>
   , then the last line of thread 2 should be
   <code>
    listX.add(...)
   </code>
   (typo was
   <code>
    list.add(...)
   </code>
   ).
