  I am trying to test the error message/catching the IOException and my code does not catch the intended error. I visited office hours and was told that my code was right and maybe it has to do with Read-only files on a Mac. Is there a certain way to make files read-only besides "format" --&gt; "prevent editing"? Any suggestions?

  For MacOS, right click on the file, select "Get Info", scroll down to the bottom, in "Sharing &amp; Permissions", set the privilege of concerned party as "Read only".
