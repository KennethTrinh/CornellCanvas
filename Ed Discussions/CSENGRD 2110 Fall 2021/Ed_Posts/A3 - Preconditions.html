  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I was just wondering if we need to enforce the preconditions with assert statements for A3.

  Quote from the comment at the top of A3:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If a method is called with arguments that do not satisfy the Preconditions,&lt;br&gt;
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  * the behavior is undefined (the method can do anything).&lt;br&gt;
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  * You do not have to use assert statements to test preconditions. &lt;br&gt;
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  * We will not test with test cases that do not satisfy Preconditions.
