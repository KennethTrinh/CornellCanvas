 Hello,
</p>
<p>
 A little confused on where to access the files that are saved in Eclipse when trying to submit to CMS. I have completed the assignment, but can not seem to find where the file a0.java is saved. Thank you so much

  In Eclipse, use
 </p>
 <p>
  Preferences -&gt; General -&gt; Workspace
 </p>
 <p>
  In the pane that opens is "Show Workspace path". That shows you where the Eclipse workspace is on your computer.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now navigate to that place on your hard drive. You will see all your projects there. We demoed this today at the beginning of the lecture
