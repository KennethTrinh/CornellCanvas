  Hi! I am not sure that why can't interfaces have fields? I remember I once read that interfaces could have fields with modifiers public static final? Thanks!

  A "static final field" is just a constant value.  It is not a "member" of any objects, so we don't need to worry about tricky multiple-inheritance issues like the "diamond problem" (see JHT).

  Other kinds of fields are mutable and should generally be encapsulated (private).  But interfaces are all about the public, well,

  that other code uses to interact with an implementing class, and encapsulated mutable state is not a part of that.  So that's another reason on top of the multiple-inheritance concerns for interfaces to not have mutable fields.
