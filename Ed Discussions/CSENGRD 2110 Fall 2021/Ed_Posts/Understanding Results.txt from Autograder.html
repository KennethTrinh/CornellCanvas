  Hi!!
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>

  </break>
  We just submitted our A1 assignment and got the results.txt from the autograder.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  We got a message saying that " Using our version of ElephantTest to test your implementation of class Elephant. Failure in testassert(): org.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: Unexpected exception type thrown ==&gt; expected: &lt;java.lang.AssertionError&gt; but was: &lt;java.lang.NullPointerException&gt;
Passed 4 / 5 tests."
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  We have trouble figuring out which line of our code causes the null pointer exception, what is a good way to troubleshoot our code based on this result?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thank you very much!

  What typically results in a NullPointerException being thrown? Based on that, search for a case like that in an assert statement in one of your methods to see if it is possible for it to throw a NullPointerException.

  You could read the handout on page 2 about Preconditions and assert statements. It might help, depending on what your error is.
