  For those of you who have plans to leave today or tomorrow, leave!
 </p>
 <p>
  Stay safe, get home.
 </p>
 <p>
  We ourselves do not know when our final will be rescheduled, but it will be online.
 </p>

  Please read the email we sent you, or look in Ed Discussion note #1700.

   The CS 2110 exam will not be held online today - we think this sudden announcement has caused too much turmoil for you to focus on our exam, not to mention the number of students who don't have an environment or setup conducive to remote proctoring.  We are drafting a formal announcement right now; check your inboxes again in a few minutes.

     I absolutely agree. My travel plans cannot accommodate a change in exam timing.

       I have 2 exams within 12 hours in the next two days and a bus the day afterwards, it would be very difficult if this was rescheduled

       No offense to anyone but yall do realize course staff are reasonable human living beings who consider the students lifes and thoughts. They will take everyones situations in consideration and give the best possible answer and if that still does not work for your scheudule they will work with you one-on-one.

        I believe we all realize and know this. I think everyone is just really stressed out and the wording of the posts is a result of that.

     I have travel plans that need me to take the exam today and they cannot be rearranged at this point. I don't think my tickets can be refunded now... Please do not change the day of the exam.
