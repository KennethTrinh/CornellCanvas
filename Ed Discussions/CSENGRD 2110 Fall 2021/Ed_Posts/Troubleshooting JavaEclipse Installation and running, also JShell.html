   If you have a new Apple MacBook with the M1 chip, Eclipse may crash when you open it. Some got around this problem by using Eclipse 2020-12:
   <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2020-12/r">
    https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2020-12/

   JShell hangs when pasting. See note #25.

  Hi,
 </p>
 <p>
  I'm having trouble installing the formatting preferences in Eclipse. I have fixed the compiler and encoding issues in Eclipse and have downloaded and unzipped the file containing the .epf formatting preferences file.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I get to the window where I have the option to hit the "Browse" button to select the file the only highlighted part of the Finder window is the file type selector (see attached photo).
 </p>
 <p>
  I am using a MacBook Pro (13-inch, M1, 2020) running OSx 11.0.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks in advance, any insight would be greatly appreciated,
 </p>
 <p>
  Liam

   When you browse for the file, do you have it downloaded in the Documents folder or the Downloads folder? If you go to the appropriate folder, the epf file should be visible and clickable.

   Note: If you are going through "Eclipse Save Preferences" and are using Eclipse 2020-12, the items for "Java Feature" are in the "Unnecessary Code" tab.
