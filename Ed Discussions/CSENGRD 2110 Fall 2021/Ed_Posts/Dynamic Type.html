 Hi, I know this is a topic from a while ago, but I know that if a method is called, the dynamic type is what determines what method will be executed at runtime, but static type will determine what methods are allowed to be called at compile time. What is an example of a pointer that has a static type of b, and a dynamic type of a superclass of b? If I just try to assign b to an instance of a super class, it is not allowed, so how can I get to that situation?
