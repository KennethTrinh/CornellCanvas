<p>
 Are the bounds for the checkHit target supposed to be just the circle or can it be a rectangle?
</p>
<p>
 From the spec, it says "target's circular area" however in #1052, it sounds like we can just leave it as a rectangle which extends beyond the area of the target? Is this a correct assumption?
</p>
<p>
 Thank you!

  a hit should occur only when the click is in the circle, not the bounding box
