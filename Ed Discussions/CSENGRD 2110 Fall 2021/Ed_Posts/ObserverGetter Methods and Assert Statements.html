 If we have our assert statements in our constructors to enforce preconditions, are we required to enforce those same preconditions in the observer/getter methods? (since the information observer methods get has already been run through assert statements in the constructors)

  No, do not put assert statement in the observer methods --they have no preconditions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Remember: If the preconditions are all asserted properly, every method that changes the object keeps the class invariant true. Therefore, the observer methods should assume that the class invariant is true.
