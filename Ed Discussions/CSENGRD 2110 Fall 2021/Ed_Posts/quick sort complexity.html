  Hi! I am a little confused about  why does the quick sort's worst case time complexity is O(n^2) instead of O(n) and why the averaged time is O(n logn)?

  In the worst case, the array is already sorted, and it performs the partition a total of n times because the pivot value is the smallest value so the leftmost section to be sorted is empty.. The partitioning algorithm itself is O(n) regardless of what the array is: we're always going to swap elements for each iteration in the partition algorithm. Combining this with the recursion depth O(n) makes the worst-case complexity O(n^2).

  I don't think we covered the proof of the expected case in lecture and the calculations involved are a bit difficult, so maybe take Prof. Gries' word for it? Hopefully the worst-case scenario made sense though! The proof of average time was worth a PhD back 40-50 years ago!

  While this is true if you always pick your pivot to be the beginning or the end of the array, you can also have a worst case scenario if you pick the lowest or highest value in the array. This would give you only 1 group to sort, and so you will have n groups to be iterated over n times, which gives you O(n^2) complexity.
