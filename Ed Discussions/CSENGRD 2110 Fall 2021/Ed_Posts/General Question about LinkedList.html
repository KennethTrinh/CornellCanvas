  Hi!
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>

  I have a general question about LinkedList after reading the pdf on our textbook! For both singly and doubly linked list, would inserting an element at ith place have a runtime proportional to i (since we have to access the ith element and then change the prev and next field)?
  <break>

  Thank you very much!

  Yes, given I &gt;= 0, one has to search from the head of the list (or the end of list) for node number I, and that takes time proportional to i.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Please do not use "ith". When i is 0, what does "0th" mean? What does "1th" mean?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The first element is element number 0, the second is element 1.

  Thank you very much! I will remember not to use "ith" in the future!
