 Would n^2 + 1 have time complexity of O(n^2) in this example?
</p>
<p>
 If inserting 6, the algo would be looking past 1, 3, 5 for a place to put it even though it's event? Is that why we need 3 tests?
</p>
<p>
 What n + 1 case? Since we're adding integers to the tree from least to largest would the BST degenerate to a linked list? So the algo would do n + 1 steps to figure out where to drop the node and a we see an O(n) time complexity?

  If something takes n^2+1 time, it would be O(n^2).
 </p>
 <p>
  Besides that, inserting 6 will take O(n) time because it would take at most 3 tests as there are three odd numbers in 1..5.  I think it depends on how you code your insertion algorithm for the BST?  The first line of code would be checking if the 6 is an odd number or not, and that would just take 1 test.  And if check 6 towards the bottom of your code, it would take at most 3 tests since there are 3 odd numbers in 1...5.
 </p>
 <p>
  Worst case of insertion in a BST is O(n) time.  You will be searching n+1 elements, which is basically the whole BST.  n+1 takes time proportional to what the value of n is.
 </p>
 <p>
  Also it is important to know that the best case of searching/deletion/insertion in a BST is O(nlogn).  So if you were searching for an element very close to the root of the BST, it will probably take O(nlogn) time.
