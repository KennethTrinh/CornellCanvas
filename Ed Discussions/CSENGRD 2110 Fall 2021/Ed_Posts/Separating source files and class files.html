 We are told to separate source files and .class files in different folders, but aren't all class files saved as java files? Could someone clarify what is meant by this?

  A file like  A0.java  contains Java source code, in this instance, class A0.
 </p>
 <p>
  This file is compiled (translated) into the Java virtual machine language and stored in file A0.class. It is this version of the program, A0.class, that is actually executed.

  The following image shows my Eclipse package explorer, showing project Recitation 01

  All the files for this project are stored on my hard drive. If I navigate to where Eclipse store the files, in a
  <i>
   workspace
  </i>
  , it looks like this:

  You can see that directory  src. contains  the file for class Rec01. If you click directory bin, you will see file Rec01.class. You can open it in a text editor, but most of it will appear as gibberish or ???
 </p>
 <p>
  Please DO find out where your workspace is on your computer and compare the Eclipse Explorer pane with that workspace on your hard drive.
