  The grading scheme on canvas says that Assignments are worth 36% of our grade each in range 1..6. There are 9 assignments (A0 through A8), so does this mean that 3 will effectively be dropped?

  I believe this means they each contribute somewhere in the range of 1 - 6% of our grade respectively, depending on their length/difficulty

  The thing is that row in the table on Canvas contains the quantity of assignments. Like right next to it it says "5 of these" for canvas quizzes and "3 of these" for CMS quizzes, not the % weight of the assignments.

  I don't think so. You can see the weighting of each assignment on cms, they are not weighted equally. I see on cms that A0 is 1%, A1 is 5%, A2 is 2% and so on. Together, all assignments should add up to a weight of 36%.

  I understand it's different from what's on CMS and they should add up to 36%, I was just curious what was meant by the quantity each in 1..6 which implies we're only graded on 6 assignments.

  Each assignment is between 1-6% of your grade, and there are 9 of them.  It does not mean you will be graded on only 6 assignments.  "Each of these" implies every assignment.
