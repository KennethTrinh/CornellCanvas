<p>
 when an assignment to a variable is calculated each iteration of a loop (it changes each time), i understand that the variable should be assigned inside the loop, but should the variable be declared before the loop starts or just at the same place it is assigned?
</p>
<p>
 for example:
</p>
<p>
 int x;
</p>
<p>
 while(condition){ x= something;}
</p>
<p>
 OR
</p>
<p>
 while(condition){int x= something;)
</p>

  If the value of x is needed from one iteration to the next, then it should be declared before the loop and
  <i>
   Its meaning should be placed in the loop invariant!!!
  </i>
 </p>
 <p>
  If it can be written as you say,
 </p>
 <p>
  while(condition){int x= something;    )
 </p>
 <p>
  then the value is NOT needed from one iteration to the next and the declaration should be in the repetend and not before the loop.
