 <paragraph>
  when an assignment to a variable is calculated each iteration of a loop (it changes each time), i understand that the variable should be assigned inside the loop, but should the variable be declared before the loop starts or just at the same place it is assigned?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  for example:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  int x;
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  while(condition){ x= something;}
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  OR
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  while(condition){int x= something;)
 </paragraph>

  If the value of x is needed from one iteration to the next, then it should be declared before the loop and
  <italic>
   Its meaning should be placed in the loop invariant!!!

 <paragraph>
  If it can be written as you say,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  while(condition){int x= something;    )
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  then the value is NOT needed from one iteration to the next and the declaration should be in the repetend and not before the loop.
