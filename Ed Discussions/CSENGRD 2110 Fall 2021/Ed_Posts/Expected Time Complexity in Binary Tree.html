  Is the reason that the time complexity is not O(n) is because the question does not specify if this is a binary search tree?

  The time complexity is O(n) because you have to search the whole tree to find a value in the tree.  Even as a binary search tree, the complexity could be O(n) when the tree is not balanced. Suppose you have a binary search tree where all the values are added to the tree in ascending order. In that case, the tree just acts like a linked list and the complexity to search that tree would still be O(n)
