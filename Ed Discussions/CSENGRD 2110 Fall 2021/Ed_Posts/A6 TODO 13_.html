  For TODO 13 my partner and I were able to center the titles for the sliders and have them fit all available space. However the font size doesn't become bigger, are we supposed to write in the increase in size or is it supposed to happen automatically.

  The font size for the labels you add above the sliders will not automatically be larger than the default; you must increase that size yourself.
