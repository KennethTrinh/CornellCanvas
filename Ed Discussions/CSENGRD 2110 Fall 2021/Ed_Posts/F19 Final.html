  Itâ€™s possible to have f(x) in O(g(x)) but f(x) &gt; g(x) for all x. True. e.g. 2 in O(1).
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I don't quite understand the reasoning provided to explain why the answer is true.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Is it because 2 &gt; 1?  As in f(x) = 2 and g(x) = 1? Wouldn't O(2) degenerate to O(1)?

  Yes, f(x) = 2 and g(x) = 1 is a goo example.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  But remember the definition of f(x) in O(g(x)): There exists  c&gt;0 and N&gt;0 such that f(x) &lt;= c*g(x) for x&gt;= N.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  So, take c + 3, for example, and
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  f(x) = 2 &lt;= c*g(x) = 3*1 = 3 for all x.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  O(2) and O(1) are the same sets
