  All classes in Assignment 3 should be in a package named "a3".  In general, you should avoid putting any code in the "default" (unnamed) package - in a production environment, this leads to "namespace pollution" where you risk using the same name as someone else for different code, and some tools (including JShell) don't work with pre-compiled code in the default package.  It's fine for demos, but not for deliverables.
