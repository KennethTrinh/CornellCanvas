 How do I check loop invariant questions on the practice prelims since there are multiple ways to draw them for some of the questions? Since this also effects the rest of the answers, I want to check but I'm not sure how.

  If you have a slightly different answer to a question like that, you can post an Ed question with a screenshot of the prelim question and your answer and we'll tell you if that answer is correct/works. Most prelim questions with multiple possible correct answers will include them
