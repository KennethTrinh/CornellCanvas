 I submitted the prelim accommodation quiz before the deadline because I have a lab class from 2:55pm-9:55pm every Thursday that I cannot miss.  However, under my CMS comments it still says that I should report to Kennedy Hall from 7:30-9:00pm on Thursday.

 Will this be updated or should I reach out to someone to discuss about the conflict?

 Thanks!
