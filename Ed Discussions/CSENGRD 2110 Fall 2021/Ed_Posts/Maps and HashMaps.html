 I remember reading in a previous ED post that Hashing would not be on Prelim 2. If Hashing is not on Prelim 2, are Maps and HashMaps still a possibility?

  Look at the Java API documentation for Maps. You have to know how to USE a HashMap, not how it is implemented. Maps WERE discussed in a recitation.

   Yes, according to the prelim study guide, you should be familiar with Java collections framework and HashMaps is listed under that.

    How should we go about studying HashMaps if hashing is not on the prelim? In other words, what components of HashMap should we be familiar with?
