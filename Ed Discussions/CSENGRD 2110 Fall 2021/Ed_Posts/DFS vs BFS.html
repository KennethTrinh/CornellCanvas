  Would the converse be true? If not, what would be a case where DFS is faster than BFS, and vice versa?

  If we’re looking at the same graph, DFS and BFS have the same time complexity (according to the slides). The only way you could maybe make one faster than the other is if you use a list representation for a dense graph (which would make it slow) or a matrix representation for a sparse graph (which would make it fast). But whether you use DFS or BFS specifically doesn’t make one faster over the other.
