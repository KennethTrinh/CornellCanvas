 I was just curious on why we needed to use anonymous functions in assertThrows() instead of calling the function/method directly.

  Check out the documentation for assertThrows(). It takes a Class&lt;T&gt;, and an Executable, which is a functional interface. Trying to call the method will give you a compile-time error, since assertThrows() expects an Executable, nothing else.
 </p>
 <p>
  When you use an anonymous function, you are essentially creating a class that implements the Executable interface, and then defining the method using the anonymous function(the body of the anonymous function is where you insert your method call). The Executable is used here like a wrapper to test code that can throw some kind of Throwable.
