 since we can't use getParent, should we be working from the root of "this" H1N1Tree down to Person c rather than starting at person c and working back up? i remember an example we did at one point where it was easier to work backwards, is that not the case here?

  Well, you are not using the specification of the method to help you.
 </p>
 <p>
  Suppose the Tree is as shown below. Suppose the initial call is  A.H1N1RouteTo(F).
 </p>
 <p>
  B is a child of A. What does the recursive call  BH1N1RouteTo(F)  return? Give the
 </p>
 <p>
  answer exactly, according to the method specification. And what do you have to do
 </p>
 <p>
  to that returned value to get the answer for the initial call?
 </p>

          /   \
         B       C 
       /  \      \  
      D    E      G
           |
           F

   Use recursion.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the recursive case, call the method recursively on the children of the root node.
  </p>
  <p>
   The difficult thing for people is wondering how the list of Person's gets constructed. Don't think about this. Think only about What the recursive guarantees to return --its given in the specification.

    i guess i don't really understand what else to think about than how the result is constructed.
   </p>
   <p>
    my thinking is the recursive call looks something like this--
   </p>
   <p>
    path to ch (from root) + path from ch to c
   </p>
   <p>
    -- but it is either incompatible with my base case, or i just don't know how to implement it correctly
