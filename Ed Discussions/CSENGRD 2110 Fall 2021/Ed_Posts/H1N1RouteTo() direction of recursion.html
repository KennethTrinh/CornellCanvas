  since we can't use getParent, should we be working from the root of "this" H1N1Tree down to Person c rather than starting at person c and working back up? i remember an example we did at one point where it was easier to work backwards, is that not the case here?

  Use recursion.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  In the recursive case, call the method recursively on the children of the root node.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The difficult thing for people is wondering how the list of Person's gets constructed. Don't think about this. Think only about What the recursive guarantees to return --its given in the specification.

  i guess i don't really understand what else to think about than how the result is constructed.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  my thinking is the recursive call looks something like this--
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  path to ch (from root) + path from ch to c
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  -- but it is either incompatible with my base case, or i just don't know how to implement it correctly

  Well, you are not using the specification of the method to help you.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Suppose the Tree is as shown below. Suppose the initial call is  A.H1N1RouteTo(F).
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  B is a child of A. What does the recursive call  BH1N1RouteTo(F)  return? Give the
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  answer exactly, according to the method specification. And what do you have to do
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  to that returned value to get the answer for the initial call?
