 I just submitted hw1 and was wondering how long it typically takes to get a response after submitting to CMS. Also, if someone responds after the deadline, could I still make changes and get the full credit since I originally submitted the assignment on time?

  For HW1, you should not expect a response from the grader until after the deadline.  They will grade everyone's submissions as a batch, and then e-mail those who need to iterate more.  Those exchanges will take place over e-mail, so you don't need to worry about the CMS submission window after that point.

  If your original submission is sufficient, then your grade and feedback will become visible in CMS once grades for this assignment have been released.

   You don't get a response from CMS after submitting. All you have to do is check if it says submitted in the UI.
