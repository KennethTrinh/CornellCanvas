<p>
 <b>
  1. The two files belong in the default package.
 </b>
 The two files we gave you do not have a package statement at the top.
</p>
<p>
 Therefore, they should be placed in the default package. After you have started a new project for A2, copy the two files, place your mouse over the directory src in the project, and paste.
</p>
<p>
 Or, drag them from your hard drive window to src and release.
</p>
<p>
 Class A2Test.java may show errors because JUnit 5 (Jupiter) is not on the build path. An easy way to fix that is to create a new JUnit Test Case class; when it has been created, delete it.
