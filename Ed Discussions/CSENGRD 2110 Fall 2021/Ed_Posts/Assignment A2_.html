   1. The two files belong in the default package.
  </bold>
  The two files we gave you do not have a package statement at the top.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Therefore, they should be placed in the default package. After you have started a new project for A2, copy the two files, place your mouse over the directory src in the project, and paste.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Or, drag them from your hard drive window to src and release.

 <paragraph>
  Class A2Test.java may show errors because JUnit 5 (Jupiter) is not on the build path. An easy way to fix that is to create a new JUnit Test Case class; when it has been created, delete it.
