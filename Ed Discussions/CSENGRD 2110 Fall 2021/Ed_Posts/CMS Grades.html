  Are the current grades on CMS an accurate representation of what our assignment, hw, and quizzes grade would be with the given weights?

  All weights have not been finalized. That will happen this weekend.

  Not all grades have been downloaded to the CMS from Canvas yet.

  Remember that we said that one Canvas Quiz would be dropped.

  That is not and cannot be indicated on the CMS.
