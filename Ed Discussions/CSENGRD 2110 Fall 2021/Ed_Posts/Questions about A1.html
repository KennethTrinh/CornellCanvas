  1) When writing Javadoc comments, is it ok if we just copy the ones given in the directions? Would this constitute an academic integrity infringement?

  2) To help with any method that involves incrementing a parent's number of children, are we allowed to write a giveBirth() method for class Elephant? I'm aware that we are forbidden to write any extra methods for class Elephant, but my partner and I can't think of any other way to increment another Elephant's number of children since the numChildren field is private.

  It is BEST if you copy. This has nothing to do with academic integrity infringement.

  No, you may not add any methods.
