<p>
 For testing insertAfter(), should we include a test case where n is the tail node? Thank you!

  It's up to YOU to determine what test cases you create.
 </p>
 <p>
  You have had a recitation on testing.
 </p>
 <p>
  You know about black box testing and white box testing and getting goo code coverage and checking corner/extreme cases. Use all this to develop your test cases.
