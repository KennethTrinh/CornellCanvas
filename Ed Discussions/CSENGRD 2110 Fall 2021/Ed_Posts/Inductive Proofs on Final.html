  Hi, I just wanted to confirm that inductive proofs will not be on the final? It appeared on some of the practice finals (S15), but was not explicitly listed on the study guide.

  Did we talk about inductive proofs in CS2110? Is that topic on the study guide?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  No. No.

  Therefore, inductive proofs will not be on the final.
