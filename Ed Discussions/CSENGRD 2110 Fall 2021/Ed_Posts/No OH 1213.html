  Hi everyone,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Hope you are all doing well. I'm scheduled to have office hours on Monday, 12/13 from 2:30pm - 4:30pm, but I have to leave for home that day, so unfortunately I can't do them then. I will be holding makeup office hours on Zoom at the same time (2:30-4:30) tomorrow, 12/12, at this link:
