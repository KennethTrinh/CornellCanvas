  What does the following sentence mean?
 </paragraph>
 <pre>The sum of an empty set is 0; its product 1. This is because 0 + anything = anything and 1 * anything = anything.
</pre>
 <paragraph>
  I still don't know how to get the state of b given this sentense.

  Suppose you have a bag of coins, and it contain two: a quarter and a dime.
  <break>
  </break>
  The sum of the bag is 25 + 10: 35.  Its product is 25* 10 = 250
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Suppose the bag contains only a dime.
  <break>
  </break>
  The sum of the bag is 10. Its product is 10.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Suppose the bag is empty.
  <break>
  </break>
  The sum of the bag is 0. Its product is 1.

  I don't see Rec Problem set Q2. We all should not have to look it up. Please place the question here.

  But if it is something like this: Initialize s and k so that:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Invariant: s = product of the elements in array segment b[0..k-1].
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Then, it's best to make b[0..k-1] empty.  That means having the assignment:  k= 0;
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  But s is then the product of an empty bag, so use:  s= 1;
