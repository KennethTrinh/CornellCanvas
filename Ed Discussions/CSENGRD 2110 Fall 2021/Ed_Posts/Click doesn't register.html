  Sometimes when I click the circle it doesn't register, but other times it will change color to red and update the score. I realized that it only works if I click the top left portion of the target. What is affecting this?

  Perhaps you are not calculating correctly whether the click is in the circle.

  I recommend that you use the sliders to make the circle as big as possible and to slow down the speed as much as possible. Now you can test your calculation a bit more thoroughly and carefully. If you click in the circle, it should turn red. If you click anywhere outside but still in the circle's bounding box, it should stay blue.
