  My partner and I are trying to follow the "pair programming" instructions found on the Canvas homepage. However, it says that there should be a "saros accounts" assignment on CMS with our passwords to login into our Saros accounts. However, my partner and I do not see this assignment. Where can we find our Saros account passwords or when will that assignment be posted?
