  I got my sliders to work now. I can see the radius of the circle changing and the speed of the circle when it is moving also changing. When the I restart the game by clicking start button, the size and the speed stay the same as what it was at the end of the last game. I guess that is because the sliders stay at that same spot. When I close the application and run the main method again, everything goes back to the initial stage. I just wanted to make sure this is how everything should work.
