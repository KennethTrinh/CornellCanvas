 For the first test case set where we are testing the constructor, should we only include the test provided to us in the pdf file about the assignment? Should we be testing for anything other than instances of empty lists for this first test? The rest of my tests already check to ensure nodes are properly added to DList after DList is first initialized as an empty list.

  You need only that one test.

  The constructor was written by us. And tested.
