 Hey, was making a program to solve matrices, and in trying to load the GUI keep getting a problem where its just literally not running what I'm typing into eclipse, using some old code I wrote a while ago instead of the new code. I tried making the Jframe a local component instead of a field and not using the swingUtilities.invokeLater function, but it isn't working. Here's a screenshot of the code, as well as the output.

 Also, if anyone knows how to get setIconImage to actually work that would also be greatly appreciated.
