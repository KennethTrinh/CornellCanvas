  I'm not quite getting what the parent Component should be for showOpenDialog. I figured it was GameMain based on some things I saw through some Google searches, but I'm not sure. or frame?

  What TODO are you doing?

  As I peruse my two files, I don't see a need for ShowOpenDialog.

  If you are doing TODO 15, it's supposed to show a "save file" dialog.

  The spec says to use parameter frame as the parent of any dialogs.
