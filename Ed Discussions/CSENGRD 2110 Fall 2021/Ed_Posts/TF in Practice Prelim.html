 Why is this statement false?
</p>
<p>
 "A binary search tree to implement a set of ints is faster than a hash tables in practice."
</p>
<p>
 My reasoning was that because hash tables have the possibility of collisions, it is slower in practice than a binary search tree.

  How can they be when they are part of hashing and hashing is not on the prelim?

   The expected times to add a value to a hash table and to look for a value in a hash table are both O(1).
  </p>
  <p>
   The expected times for the same operation on a BST is much more --if it is balanced, then O(log n) for a tree with n nodes.
  </p>
  <p>
   We haven't discussed hashing yet, and it is not on prelim 2.

    Thank you for the clarification! Just to confirm, this means like topics such as collisions and linear probing will not be on Prelim 2 either?
