  I don't think I'll be able to make the prelim 1 because I have a soccer match on October 5th from 5:30 to 7:30. I was just wondering is it possible for me to take the exam on another day or after 8pm?

  Thanks for the heads-up on this.

  Soon, we will be announcing the prelim and providing a way for you to tell us about such conflicts in an orderly manner. Please wait until then. Have no fear, we'll handle it appropriately.
