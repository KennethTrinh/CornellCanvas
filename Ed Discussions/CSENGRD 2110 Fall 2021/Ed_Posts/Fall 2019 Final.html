  Why do have the third line of code with the if statement?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Also why is it ob_size-size instead of size- ob_size?

  Read the problem statement carefully - there is a sentence that begins with "if" in it that likely corresponds to the if-statement in the code.  Also, remember the specification of
  <code>
   compareTo()
  </code>
  and think about how that relates to sorting in

   decreasing

  order.  Work out some examples.  You should be able to derive this kind of code on your own after this course.
