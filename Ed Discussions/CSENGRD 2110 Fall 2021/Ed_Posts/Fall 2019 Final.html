 Why do have the third line of code with the if statement?
</p>
<p>
 Also why is it ob_size-size instead of size- ob_size?

  Read the problem statement carefully - there is a sentence that begins with "if" in it that likely corresponds to the if-statement in the code.  Also, remember the specification of
  <code>
   compareTo()
  </code>
  and think about how that relates to sorting in
  <i>
   decreasing
  </i>
  order.  Work out some examples.  You should be able to derive this kind of code on your own after this course.
