  I successfully created the file drop down menu, however now the bannister covers my score. Does this mean that my score is not in the right position? When I comment out TODO14, the score seems to be in the correct place. I added screenshots to show what I mean.

  You are using BorderLayout when you should not, because that would cover the score.

  Ah I see. So does that mean I should use swing constants? I'm slightly confused when to use one over the other
 </paragraph>

  EDIT: I tried to use Swingconstants and that doesn't seem to work. I thought swingconstants would work since the add method for frame is (component, int), however it keeps messing up. Also, reading the specification further, I don't understand why BorderLayout is even allowed in the add method of frame, since it is a string and none of the JFrame add methods that I have seen include (component, string) parameters.

  Are you using any specific method from the frame class that deals with JMenu Bars?

  Ah I see now. I was just using the add method to add the menu and aligning it whereas there is a specific method to add menus. Thank you!
