  I submitted both files in cms and for my test file, I get the line that Your ElephantTest.java does not compile
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  In eclipse, I am able to run the test cases with the green bar and error messages if an assertEquals is false. I don't see any compiler errors pointed out by eclipse, so I was wondering what is a possible reason this is happening. Thanks
