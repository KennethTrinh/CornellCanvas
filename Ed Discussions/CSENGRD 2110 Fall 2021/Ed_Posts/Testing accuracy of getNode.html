 Because getNode gives us a node, how can we check in our j unit test class that the node gotten is correct without having a toString function within the node class? Would we still use assert equals?

  Yes, use assertEquals. Two ways you can test:
 </p>
 <p>
  1. You can test the pointer to the Note. That requires that you save the pointer beforehand to the Node.
 </p>
 <p>
  2. Ensure that all values in the linked list are different. Then you can test for the value in the Node.

   I am having trouble creating a pointer to the node because when I can't create a Node in the j unit test class. Also, I am unable to get the value of the node because toString() does not return the actual value since the Node class does not have a toString() method.
