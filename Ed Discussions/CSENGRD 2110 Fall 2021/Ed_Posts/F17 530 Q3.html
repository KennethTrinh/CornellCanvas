 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 I was just wondering why for E.m(1,false) would lead to 5 being printed out. I thought that 1/0 would lead to an Arithmetic error, but in this case, would it be a RuntimeException?

<p>
 Thank you!

  It would cause an Arithmetic Exception, which is a Runtime Exception. Divide by 0 is an exception not an error.
