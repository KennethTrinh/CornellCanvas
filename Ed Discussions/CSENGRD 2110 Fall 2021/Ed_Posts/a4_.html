<p>
 for my prepend method i got it to work however I used two if-statements in the beginning one for when size == 0 and another for when size == 1 and then an else statement for anything bigger. Is there a better way of doing this method or do you have to include these if-statements? Thanks
</p>

  It's up to you to do it the best way you can. If what you describe is correct --passes good test cases that you wrote-- then that is fine. You do not have to have the "best" way of doing it, if there is a "best" way.
