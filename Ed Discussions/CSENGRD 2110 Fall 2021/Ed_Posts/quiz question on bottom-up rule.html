  For this question, if the printMe() method in Derived was moved below foo(), would the printMe() method in Base be called or would it still be the printMe() method in Derived?

  Before I answer this, tell me what rule or principle you would use to answer this question.
 </paragraph>

  I get the idea that you really don't rely on rules and definitions but are almost guessing. But that will never work well. Memorize the rules and then use them.

  Aah, I see this is about the Bottom-up rule.

  Please tell me how the sequence is executed. Tell me step by step what you think.

  Derived d = new Derived(). This creates a new object d in class Derived. Then when d.foo() is called, it goes to derived foo method and then super.printme(). My question is basically does the super. start the bottom up from above where it was called or does it start from the bottom of the entire class, no matter where it was called from. My guess is that it starts searching from just above where it was called, and so the answer to my question would be it calls the printme method from Base. Is this correct?
