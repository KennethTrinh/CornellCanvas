  Hello! I just want to make sure I understand correctly. When we have a constructor, we MUST start with a call to this(...) or super(...) as the first line. If we do not do this, then Java inserts the default constructor call (e.g. C() {}). My question is, if you are writing the first constructor of a class that does not implement any other classes, we just start the constructor with assigning fields and Java will insert that C() {} call to actually create the object itself? Thank you!

  Every class you write implements the superset class of them all,  Object, if it does not

  So is it correct that after calling the Object constructor in the first line of the method body, you can still write something like this.name = name; as the second line and that will still be executed?

  Why not? Haven't we done things like that?
