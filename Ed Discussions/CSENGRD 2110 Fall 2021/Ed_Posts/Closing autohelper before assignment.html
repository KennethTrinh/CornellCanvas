  Hello staff and students,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I would like to express my displeasure with the current course policy of closing the auto-helper on the day assignments are due. I had worked on this current assignment A4 throughout the week, having it nearly done by Tuesday night, but I didn't want to submit an incomplete version to the auto-helper when I didn't yet expect it to pass all the tests. Now, as the deadline draws near, I have no idea if ANY of my methods work according to grading guidelines.

  It's not that the auto-helper closing yesterday

   incentivized

  me to do the work earlier, it just
  <italic>
   inconvenienced
  </italic>
  me at this final stage of my working process. A student who started today likely wouldn't have finished the project in time to submit anyway - I know I wouldn't have!  Students also have varying levels of busyness across any given week. Last night, I chose to study for my math exam rather than check if my code would earn me a 4/6 or 5/6 on the auto-helper.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  This tool did not and will not make me finish my work sooner. All the early closure policy does is rip away the ease of mind I might have had right as I thought I had a perfect version of this assignment ready.

  I am sorry you feel this way.  However, we have to juggle multiple constraints regarding when the AutoHelper is open, and in this case, leaving it open up until the deadline was not an option.  At least for A4, the closing time for the AutoHelper was shown on CMS (this was never the case in previous semesters - we do try to improve).
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  A reminder about the purpose of the AutoHelper: it is an
  <bold>
   integration smoke test
  </bold>
  .  That is, we try plugging your code into our systems and see if anything catches fire.  Its focus is on
  <italic>
   interfaces
  </italic>
  , not correctness: are your classes in the right package? did you spell your method names correctly? can your source code be read on non-Windows computers?  Catching these mistakes early makes the grading process much smoother - graders can focus on correctness, rather than compatibility.  But passing such a smoke test really shouldn't give you much confidence in the correctness of your code - you need to develop that confidence yourself via careful reading of the specifications and thorough testing.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  There are logistical realities regarding CMS, late submissions, and students' submission discipline that complicate when the AutoHelper can and can't be available (if the AutoHelper were to lead to
  <italic>
   more
  </italic>
  submission mistakes and confusion, then its benefit to smooth grading would be lost).  We have some ideas to improve the situation in the future, but as with any software change that affects a large number of people, we need to act carefully.  And if students are relying on the AutoHelper to give them confidence in their correctness or in the coverage of their testing, that's a worrying sign (it simply is not designed to do that).  Regardless, we always recommend getting an early start on projects, and if the AutoHelper isn't encouraging that, we'll need to revisit it to remove that dissonance.

  I appreciate your response! Thank you for clarifying the purpose of the auto-helper - I honestly had not realized that it was more for interfacing purposes than anything else. I realize that the auto-helper could be passed with a minimal amount of work if you just set up the proper interface and wrote functions that satisfy certain test cases. I still fail to see why leaving it open is problematic, but I guess y'all have thought about it more than I have. Apologies for the tone of my comment - it was more due to my procrastination than anything else.
