 Since 0 is not less than 0?

  0..k are just the
  <i>
   indices
  </i>
  of the elements in the array.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, array b[0..k] refers to the
  <i>
   values
  </i>
  in array b from index 0 to index k.  Those values can be anything.  And that postcondition is that they have to be negative.

    Sorry I should've clarified - my question is in response to that post. You commented that "b[h..k] &lt;= 0 means: Every element of array segment b[h..k] is less than or equal to 0"
   </p>
   <p>
    Since this postcondition reads that b[0..k] &lt; 0, wouldn't that be impossible since 0 is not less than 0?
