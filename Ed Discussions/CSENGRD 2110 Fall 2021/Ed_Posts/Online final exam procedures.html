 If you indicated on our "Accept final grade" survey that you would like to take the optional final exam, then you should have just received an e-mail from CMS with the subject "[CS 2110] Final exam procedures".  Please read that e-mail and follow its instructions to ensure a smooth exam experience on Tuesday.

 If you opted not to take the final, then you may ignore all posts in the "Exams" category from here on out.  Enjoy your winter break!
