  The theorem: For a node f in the frontier with minimum d value (over nodes in the frontier), d[f] is indeed the shortest-path distance from v to f.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  As I understand it, isn't this circular? The frontier node with the shortest distance to v will of course be the frontier node with the minimum distance among frontier nodes.

  NO, it is not circular.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For a node f in the frontier set, d[f] is the length of the shortest path over paths that consist of a bunch of red (settled) nodes followed by ONE blue node:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  (v=s1, s2, s3, ..., sn, f)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  So, d[f] may not be the length of the shortest path over ALL paths from v to f.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  BUT, if d[f0] is the smallest d[..] value for nodes in the Frontier set, the theorem says that d[f0] is the shortest path length over ALL paths to f0.

  So the shortest path may not always be the path of settled nodes followed by one frontier node? For example, the shortest path may be a settled node followed several frontier nodes? But if a frontier node has the smallest d[..] value among frontier nodes, then the shortest path to that node WILL be settled nodes followed by a frontier node? And that would be because no other frontier node could possibly help you get to f0 faster if a frontier node f0 has the shortest distance among those frontier nodes?
