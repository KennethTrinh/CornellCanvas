  Could someone please explain why number (4) is a run-time error? To my understanding, the compiler accepts the cast at compile-time, but does not allow the downcast(?) during runtime because A1 does not implement I2? Much appreciated.

  A new A1 object is created. What partitions does it have? It has a partition for A1, and a partition for I1. The downcast compiles, since A3 is a valid subtype of A1. But the object that was created doesnâ€™t have a partition for A3, so there is a runtime error.
