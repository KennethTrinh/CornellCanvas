 I've got most things done for A5 and an amount of TA confirmation that my functions (at the very least) are conceptually correct.
</p>
<p>
 However, I'm having a lot of difficulties actually testing my work.
</p>
<p>
 When I run H1N1TreeTest, I'm prompted with a pop-up asking if I'd like to run "Ant build" or "And build..."
</p>
<p>
 The selection of either has yet to produce desired results.

  The instructions explained how to put the file in. You can't simply put them into the editing area, they have to be put into package a5.
 </p>
 <p>
  Close them in the editing area. Then copy them and paste them right into package a5, which you see selected in your image above.
 </p>
 <p>
  Also, I do not see directory data.
 </p>

  Please visit a staff member and get some help.

   This often means that the project is not set up properly.
  </p>
  <p>
   Let us see an image of your Project in the Explorer Pane.
  </p>
  <p>
   It sounds like you wrote a lot of your methods and are now beginning testing.
  </p>
  <p>
   That is the wrong way to proceed. We continually say to get one (or two if they form a group of some sort) fully tested and correct before moving on to the next one.

    I created the A5 project and then the a5 package but couldn't figure out how to put files from the A5 Skeleton into the project/package.
   </p>
   <p>
    So, (just to actually start the project and not be halted by my lack of understanding of the software) I elected to drag and drop each file from the A5 skeleton into the editing area, and then actually start the project.
