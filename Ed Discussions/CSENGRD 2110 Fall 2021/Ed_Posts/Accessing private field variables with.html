 If magicShield is private, why is it that we can access it simply with "."? I know this was used in A2 and A3, but I'm still a little confused as why this is allowed. Is it that private fields can be accessed like this because we are referring to an object of the same class?

  Method launchSpell is declared in class FireGateStudent. Parameter opponent  has type FireGateStudent. Therefore  opponent.magicShield is OK. From within a class C, private fields of class C of ANY C object can be referenced.

  You did this in A1, where you added 1 to the children of the mother in addMOm
