 Can the submission deadline for A5AutoHelper on cms be extended? When submitting my assignment today in the regular submission for A5, I didn't get a response from the AutoHelper, and A5AutoHelper had a deadline of 10/19. I was wondering if this could be extended just to submit it and make sure my code compiles with the system.
</p>
<p>
 Thanks in advance!

  Also, the submission for the A5 assignment does not trigger the auto-helper.  You needed to submit to the A5-Auto helper specifically to receive feedback.
