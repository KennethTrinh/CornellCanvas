  Can the submission deadline for A5AutoHelper on cms be extended? When submitting my assignment today in the regular submission for A5, I didn't get a response from the AutoHelper, and A5AutoHelper had a deadline of 10/19. I was wondering if this could be extended just to submit it and make sure my code compiles with the system.

  Also, the submission for the A5 assignment does not trigger the auto-helper.  You needed to submit to the A5-Auto helper specifically to receive feedback.
