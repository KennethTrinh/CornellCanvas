 I am not sure if I understand this correctly.  (i) is legal because B has a partition for C as C extends B?  I am not sure why (ii) is illegal because C extends B.  (iii) is legal because class C extends B which implements I1?  Thanks.

  i is legal because ob3 will be automatically upcast.
 </p>
 <p>
  ii is not legal because ob3 is a subtype of ob2. You would have to explicitly put in a downcast, which might even throw a classcastexception.
 </p>
 <p>
  iii is legal for the reason you have suggested.
