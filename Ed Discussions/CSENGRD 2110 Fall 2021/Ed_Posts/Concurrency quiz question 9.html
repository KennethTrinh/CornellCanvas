 Hello,
</p>
<p>
 Question 9 in the canvas quiz asks whether the system will call wait() and question 9 in the document asks whether the system will call notify(). Which question should I answer?

  Apologies that those were out-of-sync - I remember changing the wording on Canvas, but apparently my edit wasn't saved.
