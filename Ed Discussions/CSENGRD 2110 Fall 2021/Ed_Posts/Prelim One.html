 If I did really poorly on prelim one should I try to meet with course staff to discuss standing in class, or try to submit regrades. I know that somewhere on canvas it says to email to discuss standing. How hard is it to comeback from this is the first prelim is only 12% of the course grade.

  If you performed poorly on the prelim, we strongly recommend meeting 1-on-1 with one of the instructors to discuss your study strategies.  It is still possible to pass the course, but it will almost certainly require changing your habits.  You can either attend Zoom-based office hours or e-mail us to set up a separate appointment.

  As for regrade requests, you should submit one if you believe an error was made in grading (that is, the rubric items that were deducted don't actually apply to what you wrote).  The points associated with the rubric items won't be changed (unless we find a systematic issue with the exam).
