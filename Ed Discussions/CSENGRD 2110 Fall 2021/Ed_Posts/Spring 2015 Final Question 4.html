  Hi!

  For question 4, concurrency, why would there be race condition problems when different threads (buttons) are looking up values in the hash map? I thought that since threads are just "reading" values, not changing the hashmap contents, there wouldn't be race conditions?

  Not entirely sure if this is correct, but the method
  <code>
   downloadWebpage(String address)
  </code>
  is not synchronized, and because that call is done after the address is found (the value reading), you could have a situation where 2 consumers can read the same address, but only one can complete the method and download it. Therefore, I think changing
  <code>
   downloadWebpage
  </code>
  to a synchronized method would remove the race condition?
