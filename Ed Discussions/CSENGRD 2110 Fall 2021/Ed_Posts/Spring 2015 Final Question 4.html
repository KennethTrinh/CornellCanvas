 Hi!

<p>
 For question 4, concurrency, why would there be race condition problems when different threads (buttons) are looking up values in the hash map? I thought that since threads are just "reading" values, not changing the hashmap contents, there wouldn't be race conditions?

 Thank you very much!

  Not entirely sure if this is correct, but the method
  <code>
   downloadWebpage(String address)
  </code>
  is not synchronized, and because that call is done after the address is found (the value reading), you could have a situation where 2 consumers can read the same address, but only one can complete the method and download it. Therefore, I think changing
  <code>
   downloadWebpage
  </code>
  to a synchronized method would remove the race condition?
