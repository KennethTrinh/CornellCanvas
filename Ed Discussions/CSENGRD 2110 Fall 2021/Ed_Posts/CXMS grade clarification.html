 Hello,
</p>
<p>
 I saw that I could check my current class standing after pressing "show grades" (I believe its the bolded number under "score"?). I was wondering if the bolded number under max is the maximum amount of points I can get in the course thus far (so if I have a class standing of 44.6 and the max is 46.1 my raw grade would be 44.6/46.1)? Are the bolded mean, median, and standard deviations from the distribution of current grades of students in the class? I'm just trying to check my relative standing. Thank you!
</p>

  Yes, when you click Show Grades is shows the Score, weight, High, Mean, Median, and Deviation for all Graded items. Yes, we believe those are all based on students who completed each item.
