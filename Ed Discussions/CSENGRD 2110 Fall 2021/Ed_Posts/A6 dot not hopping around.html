  I completed up to TODO 6, and when I run the code only one dot appears in the upper right corner. The game reverts back to the inactive state per the specification of TODO 5, but I don't see the dot hopping around, just the one original dot stays in place. What could be the problem?

  As a follow up, how are we supposed to respawn the target if the respawn() method is defined within the private inner class Target?

  If you have a variable referencing a
  <code>
   Target
  </code>
  object, then you can invoke
  <code>
   respawn()
  </code>
  on that variable in order to activate that behavior.  If the
  <code>
   Target
  </code>
  object for the game board is not respawned each time the timer expires, then I would not expect the dot to move, as that method is the only way to change its position.
