 The instructions say not to include the type of the field in the comment above the declaration of the field. For elephant mother or father, it is null if there isn't one. So should we say "null if no mother or father known" in the comment or would that be considered putting the type in it? (which we aren't supposed to do)

  null is not a type, so saying "null if no mother or father known" would be fine. We suggest using the descriptions given in the handout unless you would like to write your own.
