  Just out of pure curiosity, what is the icon that launches when you launch A6 supposed to be?  Is there any history to this icon?  I tried Googling it but I can't seem to put in the right keywords to get the answer.

  I don't know what it is supposed to be. But it indicates that a Java program is running.

  That is "Duke", the Java mascot.  You can read a little bit of history about him at

  You can of course customize the icon used by Swing frames, but if you don't, Duke is the default.
