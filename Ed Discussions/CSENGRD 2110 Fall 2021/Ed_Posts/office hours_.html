  I would say in general, the office hours and consulting hours schedule seems to be somewhat unreliable.

  It is frustrating to be counting on getting help at a certain time of day, fitting it in to a busy schedule and then nobody joins your zoom which is posted on queue me in when it says online that there are consulting hours at that time. Or for example tonight, I was relying on getting a little bit extra help from the OH 7-9 tonight before the weekend when there are zero OH, and now I have just discovered by searching on Ed that in fact the TA's office hours which are on the google calendar at this time has not been a TA since a month ago.

  I would appreciate an update to the OH calendar. Thank you.
