  In prelim2 16 SPA, it says it is ArrayList's average time of adding &amp; revamping elements from indices clustered near the end of the collection is shorter than LinkedList.

  But I thought for add(int index, element e) / remove(int index, element e), both ArrayList and linkedlist are O(n) ? Or are we referring to amortized time for arraylist which could be O(1)?
