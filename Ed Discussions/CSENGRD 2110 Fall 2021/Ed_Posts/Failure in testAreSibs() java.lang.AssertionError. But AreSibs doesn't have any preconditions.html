 I keep getting the following error: "Failure in testAreSibs(): java.lang.AssertionError." I've looked at post #105 which says this error is likely occurring because I violated a precondition in my testcase, but the A1 PDF doesn't list AreSibs as having any preconditions so I didn't put any assert statements under AreSibs. Is that wrong?

  We would have to see your code in areSibs and also your testing procedure for it. Go ahead, you can post these things in a private note. Copy paste.
