 would it be possible to explain this in a different way? i do not understand how to add a node to the HashMap without creating a new Item for its parameters. or should i just never have to add a node to the HashMap and that is the whole point? i think the last part means that the backpointer is stored as a pointer in an Item, which makes sense, but i do not understand how this is relevant to not having to create new Item objects.

  If there is already an Item object for a particular node w, which do you have to create a new Item object? Just change the existing one.

   i guess i am just confused because when adding a node to the frontier set, it also must be added to the HashMap which requires passing a Item object. for example when i add the first node, v, to the HashMap. it would not already have an Item, so wouldn't i have to create one?
