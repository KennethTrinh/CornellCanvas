 For hm a5, I followed the steps given and when I tried to run H1N1.java with (10, 10, 1, 1, .1), I always get a one-node tree with the guy either immune or dead. Is there any possible mistake in my operation?

  This can happen. Try something with the probability of connection = 1, probability of illness = 1, and probability of becoming immune = .3 or something like that.

   Wait, I realized the tree with multiple nodes was actually printed to the console. It's just the one-node tree in the GUI. So at this point, the GUI is supposed to have only one node right? Thanks for your reply!!

    I've been having the same issue. Did you figure out why it was like this?
