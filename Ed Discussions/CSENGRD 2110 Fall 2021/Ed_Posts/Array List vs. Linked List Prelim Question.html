   Why is the answer for IV Array List and not Linked List?  It takes O(n) time for an Array to insert/delete elements from a collection while it is O(1) for a Linked List.

  If the elements to be inserted or removed are clustered near the end of the ArrayList, then it doesn't take O(n) time to insert or add. To remove an element 2 from the end requires moving on two elements down in the ArrayList.

 <paragraph>
  In order to remove element i from a linked list, you have to search through I-1 elements to get to it. If that i is close to the size of the list, n, that takes time O(n).

  So you need to factor in the time of searching with the time of insertion/deletion in order to solve this problem correctly?  Thank you.
