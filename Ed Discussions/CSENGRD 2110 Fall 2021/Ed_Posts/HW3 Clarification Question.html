  For question 9 on HW3, we are asked to complete the implementation of bubbleDown(). HeapTest.java indicates in line 96 that a bubble down swap should not happen if the priorities of the parent and its child are equal. I was wondering why this is the case? Is it because we would like to prevent an unnecessary extra swap? Or is there a deeper purpose?

  You got it right. There is no need to swap if the two priorities are the same. The class invariant is now completely true. So why swap?
