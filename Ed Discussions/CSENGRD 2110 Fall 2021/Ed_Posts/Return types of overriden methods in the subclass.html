  This is such a simple thing for you to test yourself, and you would gain so much more by learning the answer yourself.

 <paragraph>
  In ANY class in any project that you have a toString() method, make sure you have @Override before the method. Now, temporarily comment out the body, put in
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  return 0;
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  and change the return type in the header to   int . Does it compile? If not, what is the error?

  Once you've determined the answer for unrelated types (like String vs. int), consider what the rules might be regarding subtypes.  Can an overridden method declare a return type that is a subtype of the inherited method?  A supertype?
