  Everytime I try to click Run to test the testconstructor1 procedure in my ElephantTest class, Eclipse keeps giving me the results for A0. I don't even have A0 open. It won't run the tests for ElephantTest at all.

  Select ElephantTest in the Package Explorer pane.

 <paragraph>
  Then select it in the editing page.

  Then try to run.

  Does that help?

  Thank you for your response. Yes, I do have ElephantTest selected. However, even when I hover over the Run button it forces me to run A0 still. There's no option to change it to run ElephantTest.

  Use menu-item  Run -&gt; Run Configurations
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  This opens a window that allows you create, manage, and run configurations. You don't have many projects yet, so this not be too difficult to figure out

  I did try this and was able to select a1, but not ElephantTest specifically. When I try to run a1, it says &lt;terminated&gt; a1 [JUnit] above the console and below it it's blank.
