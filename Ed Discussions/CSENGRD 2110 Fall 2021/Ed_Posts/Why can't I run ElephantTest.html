 Everytime I try to click Run to test the testconstructor1 procedure in my ElephantTest class, Eclipse keeps giving me the results for A0. I don't even have A0 open. It won't run the tests for ElephantTest at all.

  Use menu-item  Run -&gt; Run Configurations
 </p>
 <p>
  This opens a window that allows you create, manage, and run configurations. You don't have many projects yet, so this not be too difficult to figure out

   I did try this and was able to select a1, but not ElephantTest specifically. When I try to run a1, it says &lt;terminated&gt; a1 [JUnit] above the console and below it it's blank.

   Select ElephantTest in the Package Explorer pane.
  </p>
  <p>
   Then select it in the editing page.
  </p>
  <p>
   Then try to run.
  </p>
  <p>
   Does that help?
  </p>

    Thank you for your response. Yes, I do have ElephantTest selected. However, even when I hover over the Run button it forces me to run A0 still. There's no option to change it to run ElephantTest.
