  Hi guys,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I just arrived at Rhodes only to find out that the room I usually hold office hours in (Rhodes 400) is taken until 7 for robotics office hours. Thus, my office hours are going to be held in Rhodes 404 today (the room is currently free so I anticipate it will be for a while). Sorry for letting people know this late.
