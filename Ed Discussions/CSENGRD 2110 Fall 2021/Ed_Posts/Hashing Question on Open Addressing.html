  I'm very confused about the order of insertion for this problem. Why does the solution for start with 9 instead of 1?  Isn't the first element being computed 1?

  So for 1, it's inserted into the third slot, or h[2] since 2*1 = 2. At the same time, 9*2=18, which is modded by 6 so 18 % 6 = 0, therefore 9 is placed at h[0]. While 1 is the first element processed, 9 ends up being the first element in the hashed array.
