  And without being assigned to point at Cat, it could not access Cat's methods before right?

  If the static type of the variable is Animal, it cannot access methods ONLY declared in Cat. For example if you have Animal an = new Cat();, you can access methods in Cat that are declared in Animal or a superclass of Animal (by CTRR), but you cannot access methods only declared in Cat.

  Are you saying I can only access Cat methods that override Animal methods?

  But if I assign the Animal object to now point to a Cat object, can't it then access Cat-specific methods?

  In that case, that’s something like Animal an = new Animal(); an = new Cat(); if i’m understanding correctly.

  No, you still can’t access Cat specific methods since you haven’t changed the static type. To access Cat-specific methods, you would then have to downcast an to Cat and store that pointer in a new variable—so Cat an_cat = (Cat) an;—then you can access cat specific methods using an_cat.

  Search up CTRR in javahypertext for specific examples.

  Well if they’re overriding versions of Animal’s methods, they aren’t Cat-specific (they’re not only declared in Cat), but yes you can access overriding versions in Cat.
