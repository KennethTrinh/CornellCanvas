  You can do anything you want. We will not grade by looking at your code.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, if you have a very low grade because your submission failed on a number of sewer systems, we may look at your submission to see whether more points should be given. If we can't understand what you wrote, if methods don't have specifications, etc, if it not written well, we may decide not to look further.
