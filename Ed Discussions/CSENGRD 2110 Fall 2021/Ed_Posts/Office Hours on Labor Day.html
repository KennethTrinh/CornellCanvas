  Hi everyone! On the schedule for TA Office Hours and Consulting Hours, it looks like there will be Office and Consulting Hours on Monday. Is this a mistake or is this true? Thank you!

  Monday is Labor Day. There are no classes.

 <paragraph>
  Therefore, no office and consulting hours --unless some TAs/consulting want to hold some.

  It is not a "mistake" that hours are listed. In populating the calendar with hours, we put in one hour and indicate that it is recurring weekly, that is all.
