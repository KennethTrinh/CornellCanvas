  In my a8 I accidentally imported something I don't want/need and I realized too late to just undo. Whenever I try to delete or comment it out it just comes back immediately as soon as I hit save. Is there any way for me to remove it?

  If it is not needed, it shouldn't be imported when you click save. Something you did is requiring it. You can post your code, showing what it is, in a private note.
