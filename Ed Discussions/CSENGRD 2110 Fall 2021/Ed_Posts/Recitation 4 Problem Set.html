 Hello, everyone! I was looking for the Problem Set for Recitation 4, and as of 11:12 AM on Tuesday, I do not see it. Does any one else see the problem set posted anywhere? Am I missing something or has it not been posted yet? Thank you in advance!

  Apologies - I'm not sure why those links weren't active.  The problem set should now be available on Canvas.

   I'm sorry, but I still do not see them. This is what I see on the "Tutorial. Loop invariants" page. I am unable to click on loopProblems.docx and the remaining parts. Is there another place where I can find the problem set?

    Try the Recitation 4 page:
    <a href="https://canvas.cornell.edu/courses/29519/pages/recitation-4-loop-invariants">
     https://canvas.cornell.edu/courses/29519/pages/recitation-4-loop-invariants
    </a>
    .  We will update the Tutorial page as well momentarily.  Thank you for pointing out these issues.
