  You insert each element individually and bubble up when appropriate to maintain the max-heap.

  Every time a node is added at index k, bubbleUp(k) is called. If the node is greater (or less if it's a min-heap) than its parent, it swaps with them. I'll show the steps as an array, just remember that the parent of a node at index k is the node at index (int)(k-1)/2
