  You insert each element individually and bubble up when appropriate to maintain the max-heap.

   Every time a node is added at index k, bubbleUp(k) is called. If the node is greater (or less if it's a min-heap) than its parent, it swaps with them. I'll show the steps as an array, just remember that the parent of a node at index k is the node at index (int)(k-1)/2

   1: [31]
  </p>
  <p>
   2: [31, 11]
  </p>
  <p>
   3: [31, 11, 5]
  </p>
  <p>
   4: [31, 11, 5, 24]. 24 is the child of 11, which is smaller than 24. Swap with parent. [31, 24, 5, 11]
  </p>
  <p>
   5: [31, 24, 5, 11, 42]. 42 is the child of  24, which is smaller than 42. Swap with parent. [31, 42, 5, 11, 24].
  </p>
  <p>
   42 is the child of 31, which is smaller than 42.  Swap with parent. [42, 31, 5, 11, 24].
  </p>
  <p>
   6: [42, 31, 5, 11, 24, 11]. 11 is the child of 5, which is smaller than 11. Swap with parent. [42, 31, 11, 11, 24, 5]
  </p>
  <p>
   7: [42, 31, 11, 11, 24, 5, 19]. 19 is the child of 11, which is smaller than 19. Swap with parent. [42, 31, 19, 11, 24, 5, 11]
