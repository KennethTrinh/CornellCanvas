  The height of the left tree is 2, and the height of the right tree is 3. So the tree should be balanced as the heights differ by at most 1, right?

  No, some paths from root to a leaf have length 2 (edges), while others have length 4.

  Do not concern yourself about the exact definition of balanced. It differs for different kinds of trees. Just use that the max depth should be O(size of tree) and leave it at that.
