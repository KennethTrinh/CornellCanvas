  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I am trying to find the value of a coin I know is on a certain tile. Using the methods coins() or originalCoinValue() return erroneously, often to 0. They are contained in the Tile.java class.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Is there a better method or class I should be using?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thanks!

  I use coins() with no problem.  Could you elaborate?  What do you mean "erroneously"?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Also a lot of tiles do not have coins, so checking whether a tile has a coins() value greater than zero would be ideal.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Perhaps you are not accurately using coins().  First, you need to access the tile of a node with a special method, then call coins() on it.

  Thanks for the reply.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I mean the method simply does not return the correct value of the coin, according to the GUI. Often the call will return "0," or a different value that is expected of a different tile.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For example, if I call "map.get(i).getTile().coins()" it simply returns incorrectly.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Could I be accessing the tile incorrectly? Should I try using its ID?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thanks!

  What file is map in?  I access coins in a different way, without calling map.get(i)

  Sorry, Map is the allNodes collection converted into an ArrayList.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  How do you access the coins?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Maybe I shouldn't convert, it could be causing data loss/bad translation?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thanks again!

  I do node.getTile().coins()

  Right, I call that too, but it returns an unexpected value.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Ultimately, I'm trying to find all the tiles with coins and figure out their value.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I do this by creating an ArrayList of just tiles with coins called coinTiles. Then I iterate through allSets() and add tiles of coin value &gt; 0. In theory, the resulting array should contain the nodes where their coin value is greater than 0.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  However, when I print this array and the coin values, many of them show as zero, and none of them are accurate to what the GUI shoes as the tile's coin value.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Would you suggest a better method to do this?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Merci

  This is difficult to see why youâ€™re having this problem without seeing your code because I have done something similar with no problem.
