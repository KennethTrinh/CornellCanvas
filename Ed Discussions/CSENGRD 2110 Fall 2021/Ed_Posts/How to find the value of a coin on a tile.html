 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 I am trying to find the value of a coin I know is on a certain tile. Using the methods coins() or originalCoinValue() return erroneously, often to 0. They are contained in the Tile.java class.
</p>
<p>
 Is there a better method or class I should be using?
</p>
<p>
 Thanks!
</p>

  I use coins() with no problem.  Could you elaborate?  What do you mean "erroneously"?
 </p>
 <p>
  Also a lot of tiles do not have coins, so checking whether a tile has a coins() value greater than zero would be ideal.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps you are not accurately using coins().  First, you need to access the tile of a node with a special method, then call coins() on it.

   Thanks for the reply.
  </p>
  <p>
   I mean the method simply does not return the correct value of the coin, according to the GUI. Often the call will return "0," or a different value that is expected of a different tile.
  </p>
  <p>
   For example, if I call "map.get(i).getTile().coins()" it simply returns incorrectly.
  </p>
  <p>
   Could I be accessing the tile incorrectly? Should I try using its ID?
  </p>
  <p>
   Thanks!

    What file is map in?  I access coins in a different way, without calling map.get(i)

     Sorry, Map is the allNodes collection converted into an ArrayList.
    </p>
    <p>
     How do you access the coins?
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe I shouldn't convert, it could be causing data loss/bad translation?
    </p>
    <p>
     Thanks again!
    </p>

      I do node.getTile().coins()
     </p>

       Right, I call that too, but it returns an unexpected value.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately, I'm trying to find all the tiles with coins and figure out their value.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do this by creating an ArrayList of just tiles with coins called coinTiles. Then I iterate through allSets() and add tiles of coin value &gt; 0. In theory, the resulting array should contain the nodes where their coin value is greater than 0.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, when I print this array and the coin values, many of them show as zero, and none of them are accurate to what the GUI shoes as the tile's coin value.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would you suggest a better method to do this?
      </p>
      <p>
       Merci
      </p>

        This is difficult to see why youâ€™re having this problem without seeing your code because I have done something similar with no problem.
