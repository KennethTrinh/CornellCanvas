 Can we attend any recitation session between Tuesday and Wednesday, or do we have to go to our assigned sessions?

  Please go to your registered sessions. If you need to change sessions, please do so in the student center. If you have things stopping you from attending your section for a certain week, just send an email to the TA who leads the section.
