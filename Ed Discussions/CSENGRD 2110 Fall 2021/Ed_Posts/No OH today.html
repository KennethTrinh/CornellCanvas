 Hi guys,
</p>
<p>
 I'm Dhruv, a first year CS MS student. I normally hold office hours from 2:30 - 4:30 PM in Rhodes 400 on Mondays, but due to Labor Day weekend, I will not be there today. If you guys have any questions about any of the current assignments, feel free to email me at ds844@cornell.edu or comment on this post and I will be happy to answer you guys by EOD today. Thanks!
</p>
