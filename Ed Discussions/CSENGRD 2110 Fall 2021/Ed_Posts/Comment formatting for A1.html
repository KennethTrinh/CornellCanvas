  In this assignment as well as future ones, would points be deducted for any additional, non-Javadoc comments left behind in the code? For example, single-line comments that mark where Part A,  B, C, etc. starts, or that list the plans/purpose of each part?

  No, just don't put so many comments to the point that the code is unreadable.
