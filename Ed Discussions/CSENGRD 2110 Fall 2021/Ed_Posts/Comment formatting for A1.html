 In this assignment as well as future ones, would points be deducted for any additional, non-Javadoc comments left behind in the code? For example, single-line comments that mark where Part A,  B, C, etc. starts, or that list the plans/purpose of each part?

  No, just don't put so many comments to the point that the code is unreadable.

   There is no need for the kinds of comments that you suggest.
