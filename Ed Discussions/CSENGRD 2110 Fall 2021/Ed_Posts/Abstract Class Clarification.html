  I know all subclasses of an an abstract class must implement all of the abstract methods of its abstract superclass (and if it does not, it must be declared an abstract class itself). Say if the abstract superclass has non-abstract methods, the subclass does not have to override them, correct?

  No, the subclass would not have to override them since those non-abstract methods have specified implementations.
