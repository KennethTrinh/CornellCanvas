<p>
 Are the respawn targets allowed to be cut off by the edge of the component (i.e. displaying only half of it on the component, that its center current position is on the edge?)
</p>
<p>
 Or the full circles of all targets must be shown each time it respawns
</p>

  This isn't something you have to be concerned with.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yes, it may be the case, especially when the radius is as big as possible, that the target disk is so big that only part of it shows in the window, the other half being outside the frame.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is OK and not your concern.
