  How do you tell the difference between a compile-time and runtime error when casting? I am still a little confused after reading the JHT page

  Compile-time error: a downcast is made that doesnâ€™t make sense (e.g. casting from Dog to Cat)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Run-time error (aka ClassCastException): a downcast is made that makes sense (e.g casting from Animal to Dog) but the object does not have partition Dog
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Everything runs smoothly: downcast makes sense and the partition exists
