  Hello! Just a small question about A4. In the methods where we use loops in A4, should we write out our explanations of the Loop Invariants and the 4 Loopy Questions as comments or do we just need to write the methods? Thank you in advance!

  Just write the methods.

  If you can put in a loop invariant for the loop, that would be great!
