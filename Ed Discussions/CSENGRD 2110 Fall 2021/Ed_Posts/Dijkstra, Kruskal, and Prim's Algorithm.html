  Will the aforementioned algorithm's be on the prelim? Although they are not explicitly named on the study guide, searching and sorting algorithms are, so I'm not sure if these are thus included.

  Below are two quotes from the study guide. That sure includes Dijkstra, Kruskal, and Prim.

  Sorry! I must've missed that and/or misspelled "Dijkstra" when searching the pdf. Thank you for letting me know.
