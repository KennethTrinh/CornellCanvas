 I'm on TODO 13.
</p>
<p>
 If I've understood the description for this assignment correctly then I'm pretty sure that it's HEAVILY implied that we should just use JPanels for the return type of makeSliderPanel (in fact I can't really think of any other thing we should return.
</p>
<p>
 However, when I type
</p>
<p>
 JPanel out = new JPanel();
</p>
<p>
 into an otherwise empty makeSliderPanel function (save the return statement) I get a red line saying JPanel isn't imported.
</p>
<p>
 Was this intentional? Or did I just somehow accidentally delete the import statement for JPanel?
</p>
<p>
 Sub-question:
</p>
<p>
 The hitbox for my circular targets were squares, meaning the hitbox of each target actually extends a bit farther out than the actual bounds of the target display.
</p>
<p>
 I don't remember this being addressed in the documentation, but do you want a circular hitbox that EXACTLY fits the display area of the target? Or is the square hitbox approximation ok?
</p>

  import JPanel if necessary. If you press your mouse over the red x on the left of the line, you should get a pop-up with several alternatives to fix this issue; use the import one.
 </p>
 <p>
  We call the "hitbox" the BOUNDING RECTANGLE of the circle. Yes, the circle may extend outside the target display area, so you don't see it all. This is normal.
