  I'm on TODO 13.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If I've understood the description for this assignment correctly then I'm pretty sure that it's HEAVILY implied that we should just use JPanels for the return type of makeSliderPanel (in fact I can't really think of any other thing we should return.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  However, when I type
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  JPanel out = new JPanel();
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  into an otherwise empty makeSliderPanel function (save the return statement) I get a red line saying JPanel isn't imported.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Was this intentional? Or did I just somehow accidentally delete the import statement for JPanel?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Sub-question:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The hitbox for my circular targets were squares, meaning the hitbox of each target actually extends a bit farther out than the actual bounds of the target display.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I don't remember this being addressed in the documentation, but do you want a circular hitbox that EXACTLY fits the display area of the target? Or is the square hitbox approximation ok?

  import JPanel if necessary. If you press your mouse over the red x on the left of the line, you should get a pop-up with several alternatives to fix this issue; use the import one.

  We call the "hitbox" the BOUNDING RECTANGLE of the circle. Yes, the circle may extend outside the target display area, so you don't see it all. This is normal.
