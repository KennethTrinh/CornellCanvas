 I don't understand when we can and can't assign variables to interfaces

  In JavaHyperText, click on   Abstract classes and interfaces   in the upper horizontal navigation bar.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the page that comes up, watch the Casting video (or read the pdf file).
 </p>
 <p>
  When you get a question like this, it is always best to draw objects as done in the Casting video. For example, for this question, draw object b of class B. Then it's easier to answer the quetion.
