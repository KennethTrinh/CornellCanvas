  I was going to download the outline ahead of class tomorrow and I couldn't find it on canvas.

  Sorry, I have not had time to make an outline.

  This is the first semester we have had outlines --you have Prof Muhlberger to thank for it! But they take time and have to be prepared ahead of time. From now on, I'll try to produce them but not for today.

  I have just added a quick fill-in-the-blank outline to the Lecture 5 page on Canvas.  We will try to get these posted sooner in the future, but we can't make any promises.
