 Do we have to comment every line (or block of code)?  Or do we only need to comment above the HashMap definition?

  I endorse the above student's answer.

  Please don't litter your method with lots of comments. Most are not needed. Assume the person reading the method (like you) understands the abstract algorithm. That makes many comments unnecessary. Variables like F, f, and w are already known and need no comment.
