  I am reading the document about method getClass() and I cannot find out what JFrame is. I assume it's a class, but I'm confused what JFrame.class would even tell us?

  <code>
   javax.swing.JFrame
  </code>
  is a class in Java's standard library that represents a graphical window on your computer; we will discuss
  <code>
   JFrame
  </code>
  in more detail when we talk about Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs).  In previous versions of this course,
  <code>
   JFrame
  </code>
  was used as a visual example in some early lectures, and as you saw, it is also used as an example in some JavaHyperText documents.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The expression
  <code>
   JFrame.class
  </code>
  evaluates to an object representing the idea of "being a JFrame" (and not something else).  I often think of it as being analogous to the string "JFrame" in that it says what an object's dynamic type is; however, unlike a simple string, a
  <code>
   Class
  </code>
  object is more robust and has additional properties  related to Java's "Reflection" features (so beyond just storing the name of a class, it also lists what public methods are defined, etc.; it lets other code learn about the classes being used in a program and their features).
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For our purposes, we typically only use
  <code>
   Class
  </code>
  objects to ask whether two objects have the same dynamic type.  For example, if you had an object
  <code>
   ob
  </code>
  , and its static type was just
  <code>
   Object
  </code>
  , but you wanted to know whether its dynamic type was really
  <code>
   JFrame
  </code>
  , you would write this expression:
 </paragraph>
 <pre>if (ob.getClass() == JFrame.class) { // ob is a JFrame }</pre>
 <paragraph>
  If you're more comfortable thinking about names and strings, you could write something like this:
 </paragraph>
 <pre>if (ob.getClass().getName().equals("javax.swing.JFrame")) { // ob is a JFrame }</pre>
 <paragraph>
  However, comparing
  <code>
   Class
  </code>
  objects directly is more efficient and more robust than comparing class name strings.
