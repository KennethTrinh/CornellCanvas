 Why is the following true? What if the graph was a dense graph then wouldn't it be O(n^2)?

  The total number of edges in a dense graph may be ~n^2.  However, this question is asking about the neighbors of a single node.  A node can only have n-1 neighbors (if there were more, who would they be?).
