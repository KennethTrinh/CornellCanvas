 This is just something I wanted to add.
</p>
<p>
 Something I want to mention is that taking it online over in-person raises the risk of breaking academic integrity. Obviously, we should aim to preserve it as much as possible. But I feel that there should be a certain boundary that decides at what point in-person exams are really beneficial. I feel that we have went over the line at this point.
</p>
<p>
 I do want to believe that taking it in Barton Hall, which would hopefully be ventilated, would minimize the risk of spread but the consciousness that people who are all vaccinated are easily contracting it worries me. I would think that the actual case numbers reported are highly incorrect. I personally know of many individuals that are having symptoms but not getting tested to avoid quarantining so they can take exams instead of being withheld to take exams in January. I also know of many people who haven't gotten their results back and are all showing symptoms of COVID. This is past the incubation period. I would think the case numbers are drastically higher than what is being reported.

 Actually contracting COVID isn't a personal fear of mine. But it certainly would be something everyone would want to avoid. As for international students, it completely jeopardizes their plans to leave for home. As for any non-international students, we have to carry on the risk that we might spread any invariant that has shown here to our parents at home, parents who may have not been vaccinated or haven't received their booster shots. That's just something people don't want on their consciousness. Dining halls are being overridden. Some dining halls can't follow the regulation for students to take take-out. It's a hotspot for spread and we all have to eat.
</p>
<p>
 It's this state of ambiguity - with the fact that the school isn't showing us accurate live data - and the fact that there is a new variant that we just don't know anything about and how it spreads so far. I would personally rather take it in person. But I just feel like things have to be weighed out and I am questioning if in-person testing is really something we should be looking to go forward with.
</p>

 I just want to say that I am sure the professors and TAs will go forward with the option that is best for all of us as students. I respect their decision. But it certainly is scary and there certainly is a sense of doubt going through many students in every class on whether or not their health is being considered. I honestly want to say the administrators have not shown this.

 I'm not attempting to complain. I'm just presenting the thoughts of Cornell students at this time. These are thoughts I've personally had and I've discussed with many students. We are just frustrated. We just feel like no accountability is being presented by Cornell admins whatsoever.
</p>
<p>
 Whatever the professors or TAs go forward with, I will respect their decision. But I think it's best to present the thoughts of Cornell students. We are obviously in a completely different situation. We've never had cases ramp up this quick. And to simply put it, we're just scared. That's really it.
