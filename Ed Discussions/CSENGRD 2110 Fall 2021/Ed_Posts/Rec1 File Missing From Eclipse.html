 I moved my Rec1 file onto my desktop by searching it in finder. Then I submitted it on CMS. Now I can no longer see it or find it in Eclipse. I am having trouble finding A0 as well. I am wondering why I can't find these classes under rec1 and a0 anymore.

  Well, you moved the file. You have to copy it, not move it. Here is what the Package Explorer pane in Eclipse looks like.

  The actual files are in the   workspace   on your hard drive. Here is what my hard drive (on a Mac) looks like for that Eclipse image above:

  When you upload to the CMS, you should navigate to the workspace on your hard drive and then to the particular project and src on your hard drive. Don't simply move from your Eclipse PackageExplorer pane to somewhere.
 </p>

  Now, I don't know exactly how you moved. It's not a big deal with A0. You don't need that anymore. But to fix everything, it's best to see a consultant or TA in person so they can look and help you.

   Ok, thank you! I understand where to find it next time. I was able to copy and paste the code back in.
