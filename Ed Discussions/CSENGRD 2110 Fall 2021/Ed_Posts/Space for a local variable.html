  Is space allocated and deallocated for a local variable inside a for loop that's not inside a method before the for loop executed?
  <break>
  </break>
 </paragraph>

  JHT says it's allocated before the method is executed, but I'm not sure if that applies to a for-loop as well.

  Answering this question, like so many others, depends on knowing which definition or rule to use. I you don't know this definitions and rules, how can you answer the question?

 <paragraph>
  Please study how a method call is executed. Do you know the four steps? Can you write them down. When you know this, you should be able to answer this question. Let us know what your answer is.

  Here's what I found on JHT:
  <break>
  </break>
  <italic>
   As you will learn when you study how a method call is executed, space for all parameters and local variables is created before the method body is executed and space is deallocated after execution of the method body ends.
  </italic>

  If I'm using JHT's rule above, I guess, it'll be how every many iterations of the loop and then one last time when it terminates.

  I don't understand your last sentence.

  Space is allocated for ALL local variables when the frame for the call is pushed onto the call stack. There is space for all local variables and parameters in that frame for the call. During execution of the method NO space has to be allocated.
