  When I'm going through animation for the Iterative BFS on slide 29, I'm not sure why when we visit 7 that 5 isn't added to Queue again. I expected that to happen when the iterative BFS Algo has been optimized, but on slide 29 it hasn't been optimized yet.

  Is 5 not added because queue recognizes that 5 is already in the queue? When we visit 3, 5 is added to queue.
