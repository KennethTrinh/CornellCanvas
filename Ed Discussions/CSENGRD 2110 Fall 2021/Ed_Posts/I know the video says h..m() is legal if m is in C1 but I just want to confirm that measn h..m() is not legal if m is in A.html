  A is on the same level as C1 in the diagram which makes me wonder if m could also be in there and be legal?

  The video says h.m() is legal if m is declared in C1 but I'm curious if this expression would also be legal if m is in A because C1 and A are on the same level in the diagram

  Got it. So would h.m() be legal if Class A didn't exist  or can you not call methods from an interface since they all have to be abstract?

  If A implements C1, A must all of the methods of C1 I believe.
