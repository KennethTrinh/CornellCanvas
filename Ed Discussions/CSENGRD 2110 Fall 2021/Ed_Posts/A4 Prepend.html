 While writing prepend, I want to call toString written above, but toString calls append. I foresee myself calling prepend while writing append, so I am concerned that this would create an infinite loop. Is this the right track to head down?

  Why do you want to call toString in prepend? Please don't do that.

  I think you mean you want to call toString in your JUnit testing class in the procedure that will test prepend and toString together. Nothing wrong with that.
