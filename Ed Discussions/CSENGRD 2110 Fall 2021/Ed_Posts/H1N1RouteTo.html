 In the recursive case, how do we add elements to our List&lt;Person&gt; variable if all we do is declare its type without the new expression? I tried setting it to null, but that also prevents me from adding elements without an error. I am very confused, please help!

  Is this a searching method or a counting method? Once you determine that, write it to follow the pattern of that kind of method.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here's question. In the recursive case, suppose you call the method recursively on child, like this:
 </p>
 <p>
  child.H1N1RouteTo(c);
 </p>
 <p>
  and save it in a local variable of type List&lt;Person&gt;. Suppose the value returned is not null.
 </p>
 <p>
  WHAT DOES THE METHOD SPECIFICATION TELL YOU IS BEING RETURNED?

   In the method's specification (#2), it says :
  </p>
  <pre>2. The ONLY case in which this method must create a list object (using
        // a new expression new ArrayList&lt;&gt;() or new LinkedList&lt;&gt;()) is the base
        // case, when c is the root. Do NOT create a new list object using a new-expression
        // in the recursive case.
</pre>
  <p>
   So, in the base case, it should actually create a new list object and not just declare its type. I think it would be important to consider what is done with this new list in the base case and also to remember that this method is returning a List&lt;Person&gt; object.
