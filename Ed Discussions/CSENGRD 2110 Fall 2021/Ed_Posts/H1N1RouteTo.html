  In the recursive case, how do we add elements to our List&lt;Person&gt; variable if all we do is declare its type without the new expression? I tried setting it to null, but that also prevents me from adding elements without an error. I am very confused, please help!

  In the method's specification (#2), it says :
 </paragraph>
 <pre>2. The ONLY case in which this method must create a list object (using
        // a new expression new ArrayList&lt;&gt;() or new LinkedList&lt;&gt;()) is the base
        // case, when c is the root. Do NOT create a new list object using a new-expression
        // in the recursive case.
</pre>
 <paragraph>
  So, in the base case, it should actually create a new list object and not just declare its type. I think it would be important to consider what is done with this new list in the base case and also to remember that this method is returning a List&lt;Person&gt; object.

  Is this a searching method or a counting method? Once you determine that, write it to follow the pattern of that kind of method.

  Here's question. In the recursive case, suppose you call the method recursively on child, like this:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  child.H1N1RouteTo(c);
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  and save it in a local variable of type List&lt;Person&gt;. Suppose the value returned is not null.

  WHAT DOES THE METHOD SPECIFICATION TELL YOU IS BEING RETURNED?
