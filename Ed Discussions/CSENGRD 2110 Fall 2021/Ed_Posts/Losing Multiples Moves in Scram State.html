  I'm currently working on A8 and ScramState, I have the shortest path working for it and working on improving the current method.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The current strategy is to move around and collect in a while loop and execute the shortest path after that.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  My problem is that stepsToGo() method isn't using 1 every step and instead multiple steps for no reason between iterations of my shortest path.

  Each time McDiver traverses an edge, the steps-to-go are decremented by the weight of that edge.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  So it doesn't decrement by 1 for each moveTo during the scram phase.

  You can see this information in comments on abstract class graph/SewerDiver.java.
