  I didn't really understand the logical equivalence of the Hoare Triple question in the Program Correctness Question. I interpreted the solution as "{Q &amp;&amp; !B} S2 {R}" as an implication "Q &amp;&amp; !B =&gt; R" removes the need for "else S2 {R}", but I don't really understand why this is.

  Does this makes sense?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  We want R to be true when the method ends.
  <break>
  </break>
  But if B is false, S1 is not executed --nothing is executed
  <break>
  </break>
  so R better be true in the beginning.
  <break>
  </break>
  That is, whenever Q is true and B is false, R better be true also.
  <break>
  </break>
  That means that    Q and !B  implies  R
