  Could you explain why it is O(min(np,nq)) in the first picture and why the second picture, for Q2 , the answer is O(n log n)?

  Just did this question last night.  isSameTree method will return false if both both of the trees don’t share the same structure.  Let’s say that we have tree A and tree B.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Tree A looks like this:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  A
  <break>
  </break>
  B       C
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Tree C looks like this:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  A
  <break>
  </break>
  B
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Once the method detects that one node is null in the second if statement, it will return false.  That means that the method looked at the minimum nodes of tree C.

  For your second question, it looks like the first for loop counter is being doubled after every iteration, so that will give you log(n) time. In the second embedded for loop, it looks like a regular loop that iterates over n elements, so it would be n time. Since it's a nested for loop you multiply the two times together and you get O(nlogn)
