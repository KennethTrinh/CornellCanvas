 I have a question for "The development of the algorithm" with regard to shortest path tutorial.
</p>
<p>
 In loopy question 4, Prof Gries shows a graph in the upper left corner:
</p>

</figure>
<p>
 And in the transcript, it says:
</p>

</figure>
<p>
 Which one is node "w" on the second line? I'm a bit confused because I can only see w0, w1 and w2...
</p>
<p>
 Thank you!
</p>

  The picture shows three possibilities.
 </p>
 <p>
  1. There is an edge from f to w1 in the settled set.
 </p>
 <p>
  2. There is an edge from f to w2 in frontier set.
 </p>
 <p>
  3. There is an edge from f to w3 in the far-off set.
 </p>
 <p>
  You have to figure out how to handle each of these cases. Hint: (1) and (2) can be handled the same way.
