  I have a question for "The development of the algorithm" with regard to shortest path tutorial.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  In loopy question 4, Prof Gries shows a graph in the upper left corner:

 </figure>
 <paragraph>
  And in the transcript, it says:

 </figure>

  Which one is node "w" on the second line? I'm a bit confused because I can only see w0, w1 and w2...
 </paragraph>

  Thank you!

  The picture shows three possibilities.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1. There is an edge from f to w1 in the settled set.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. There is an edge from f to w2 in frontier set.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  3. There is an edge from f to w3 in the far-off set.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  You have to figure out how to handle each of these cases. Hint: (1) and (2) can be handled the same way.
