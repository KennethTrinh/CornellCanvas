  Hi.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I was wondering if there was a due date to submit prelim regrade requests, and if solutions  would be uploaded for us to compare our prelims to help us make these requests?

  Solutions to almost all questions are given in the questions themselves. Therefore, we will not be making solutions available,

  We will the a deadline for regrade  requests. Probably one more day.
