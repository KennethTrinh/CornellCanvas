  Last year, when this class was virtual, we recommended a collaborative coding plugin for Eclipse called "Saros" that allowed partners to edit the same file from different computers.  This semester we expect most partners to work together in person, taking turns between typing and reviewing.  However, there are some situations where remote collaboration may still be helpful, such as if one partner needs to isolate due to COVID symptoms or has to travel unexpectedly.

  Therefore, we have synced our Saros account server with this semester's roster.  Credentials have been posted on CMS, and instructions are on the Canvas

  Pair Programming page.  To be clear, the use of Saros is
