 I'm having trouble asserting that Node n is in the list with constant time for method insertAfter(). Wouldn't we have to make sure that Node n is in the list by going through the entire list. In which case, the time needed to assert it would be dependent on where n is in the list?

  Yes, so don't put in such an assert statement.
