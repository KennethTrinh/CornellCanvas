  for concurrency, if you are executing two processes, does process 1 have to finish before process 2 if it starts first? so for example, could you do the following:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  load x to registerA
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  add one to registerA
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  load x to registerB
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  add 2 to registerB
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  store registerB in x
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  store registerA in x
 </paragraph>

  Yes, a process may be spotted at any time and another one started.

  NO. Where do you see something talking about an order in which they have to finish?
