  I have an issue with my TODO 8 code in which I am able to click one target multiple times and the score increments each time.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  My checkHit function does set isHit to true if the target is hit, so I was wondering why the score would increment even if isHit is true.

  It looks like you are not correctly testing isHit.
