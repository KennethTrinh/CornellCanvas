  It says on CMS that the deadline for late submissions is until tomorrow night at 9 PM. On Canvas, it says they are not allowed.

  The CMS is the ultimate arbiter, since that is where the assignment is submitted.

  We just haven't had time to change Canvas yet. I'll do it now.

  So Canvas now says the deadline is 11:59PM, but CMS says the late deadline is 9:10 PM. Are regular submissions that aren't penalized still allowed right now?
