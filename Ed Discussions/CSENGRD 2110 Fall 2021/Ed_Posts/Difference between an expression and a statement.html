 Someone asked a similar question a few weeks ago but I'm still not clear. I looked at HyperText and the notes and still am confused about what the difference between an expression and a statement is in Java. It seems that many things are both expressions AND statements. Is a statement something that doesn't return something, but an expression has to? And what are some examples of things that are ONLY expressions, only statements, or both?

  An expression is evaluated to yield a value.
 </p>
 <p>
  A statement doesn't yield a value.
 </p>
 <p>
  The statement
 </p>
 <p>
  System.output.println(5);
 </p>
 <p>
  does not give a value, although it prints something out. Therefore, this is not a legal expression:
 </p>
 <p>
  4 + System.output.println(5);
 </p>
 <p>
  A while-loop is a statement to be executed:
 </p>
 <p>
  while (x &lt; 5) { s= s + x; x= x+1};
 </p>
 <p>
  The distinction get blurred in Java because the assignment statement
 </p>
 <p>
  x=  x+1;
 </p>
 <p>
  written without the semicolon, is actually defined to be an expression; its value is the value assigned to x. Therefore, one can write this:
 </p>
 <p>
  y= 5 + (x= x+1);
 </p>
 <p>
  This adds 1 to x and then stores in y the sum of 5 and the new value of x.
 </p>
 <p>
  We NEVER writes such things because it is easy to misunderstand.
