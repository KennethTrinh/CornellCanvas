  Are we supposed to complete method isIn()? There is not JUnit test case for it in H1N1TreeTest.java and it is not listed as being completed in the suggested timetable on the A5 handout, but it does have a TODO comment in the H1N1Tree.java class.

  Here is what the comment in isIn says:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  // TODO 9. Equals must call this method. Test the two methods
  <break>
  </break>
  // equals and isIN together.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Therefore, use the testing method for equals.
