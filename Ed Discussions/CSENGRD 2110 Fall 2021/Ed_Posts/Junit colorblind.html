 Maybe a silly question, but I was wondering if there is a way to make the Junit bar appear as a different color. I keep thinking it is dark green for a second :(

  The color bar is a convenient visual indicator, but the real information is in the text; e.g. "Runs: 4/4  Errors: 0  Failures: 1".  You should confirm that the "4/4" matches the number of tests you think you have written (if it doesn't, you probably forgot an
  <code>
   @Test
  </code>
  annotation) and that the numbers of "Errors" and "Failures" are both 0.  If you have an error or a failure, expand the list of tests in the sidebar and look at the tiny "x" and "checkmark" icons to see which one(s) failed and why.
 </p>

  Knowing exactly what tests are being run and which are passing gives you much more insight into your program than a bar of colors.

   Sorry, Habeeb, but I don't know how to do that. It may be possible, but it would tae too much time to find out. You could google something like
  </p>
  <p>
   Eclipse  JUnit color status bar
  </p>
  <p>
   I did that and found this webpage, which discusses it (a long time ago):
