  Maybe a silly question, but I was wondering if there is a way to make the Junit bar appear as a different color. I keep thinking it is dark green for a second :(

  Sorry, Habeeb, but I don't know how to do that. It may be possible, but it would tae too much time to find out. You could google something like
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Eclipse  JUnit color status bar
 </paragraph>

  I did that and found this webpage, which discusses it (a long time ago):

  The color bar is a convenient visual indicator, but the real information is in the text; e.g. "Runs: 4/4  Errors: 0  Failures: 1".  You should confirm that the "4/4" matches the number of tests you think you have written (if it doesn't, you probably forgot an
  <code>
   @Test
  </code>
  annotation) and that the numbers of "Errors" and "Failures" are both 0.  If you have an error or a failure, expand the list of tests in the sidebar and look at the tiny "x" and "checkmark" icons to see which one(s) failed and why.

  Knowing exactly what tests are being run and which are passing gives you much more insight into your program than a bar of colors.
