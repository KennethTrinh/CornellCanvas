  I don't understand.  Are we supposed to complete method isIn()?  The TODO does not say to complete it (only to use it in method equals()), so every call on method isIn() will just return false.  Am I missing something?

  Yes, of course you must write it. It is part of writing method equals, and method equals should call it and use its result. Sorry it was not clear.
