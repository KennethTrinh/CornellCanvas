 I was planning on taking the exam online anyways since Iâ€™m not feeling well, but seeing that we are now on alert level red and the student body is in a state of panic, would you consider just making it optional? I know this is a stretch, but I think this has now gone from worries of getting covid to a logistical issue of leaving the school as soon as possible and planning out our studying. I also know other people have mentioned that they were planning out their studying knowing they would take this final today. It really seems like perhaps the best option is to make the final optional. Would this be possible?
