 What is meant when a question is asking for the tightest complexity exactly? I interpreted it as the best case complexity, but not sure after doing this question. Is the tightest complexity simply the average complexity?

  It is the best. has nothing to do with average.

  Consider this. The function f(n) = n is in O(n), but it is also in O(n*n) and O(n*n*n). It is not in O(log n). We would say that the tightest is O(n).
