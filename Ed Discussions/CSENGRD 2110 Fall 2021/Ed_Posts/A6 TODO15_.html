 When I run my code for TODO 15, my error dialog only shows the exception's message as its text and the exception's class as its title, whereas the handout also has the exception's class in its text. I am not sure which is correct.
</p>
<p>
 (I did realize that I'm missing an error message icon)

  Printing the exception type in the dialog text before the exception's message is an "embellishment" of the reference implementation.  It is not required by the specifications, but you can add it if you think it makes the error easier to understand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Most of the time in this course we emphasize strict adherence to precise specifications, but GUIs are a good place to express some creativity, so you're allowed some freedom in font sizes, font faces, color shades, and helpful bits of text here and there.  Just make sure you don't contradict what

  required by the specifications.

  <p>
   There is something useful in JOptionPane's attributes/methods that will help you solve this problem; also, you have to print the name of the class
  </p>
  <p>
   Also, there is an error message icon in the correct implementation of TODO 15. (Hint hint: JOptionPane)
