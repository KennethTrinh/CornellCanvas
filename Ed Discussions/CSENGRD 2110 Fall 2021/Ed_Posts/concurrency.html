  are you asking what "synchronized means" I don't understand that part of your question.
 </p>
 <p>
  I don't see the actual question, so I cannot answer your second part.

   sorry for being unclear,  my question is what's synchronized used for. in JavaHyperText, "P1 finished" and "P2 finished" would not be printed and I can't understand why.

    If two (or more) processes are synchronized on the same object, the only ONE of the can be using the object at a time; the others wait. That is the basic idea. Think of the object as an outhouse with a key. Only one person can be in the outhouse at a time.
