  Hello everyone! I just had a quick question about the addMom() and addDad() methods. According to the precondition of addMom(), we must ensure that, "this elephantâ€™s mother is unknown and e is female." The precondition to addDad() is similar, so I won't write it here. I understand that this precondition means that we must assert that these things are true in the method; however, I do not see anything about asserting the birth date. As it stands now, it looks like we could add a "mother" to an elephant that is older than the proposed "mother," which seems impossible. Thus, should we just ignore the birth date of the mother and father we are trying to add? Or, should we find some way to assert that the mother we want to add is older than the elephant we want to add it to? Thank you!

  Good question. You are doing what a programmer should do when presented with an issue about a class they are writing for a client.

  A full-blown class to be used by other programs would have many more preconditions than we give in A1, such as, as you say, restrictions on the birth date. However, we are not creating such a complete, finished product but only a class that introduces you to the basics. A1 has what we consider the minimum features to get you to learn about OO programming. Nothing more should be added.

  Therefore, please use ONLY the specifications of the methods as given, and therefore assert statements only for the Preconditions given in the specifications. Don't be concerned with other things, such as restrictions on birthdates.
