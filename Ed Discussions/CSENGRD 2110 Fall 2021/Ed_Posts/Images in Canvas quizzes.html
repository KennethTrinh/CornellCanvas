 Some Canvas quizzes will have embedded images --e.g. pictures of inheritance diagrams.
 <b>
  Mac users beware: there is a known bug in the interaction between Canvas and Safari,
 </b>
 which can cause Safari not to display embedded images. The fix is easy:
 <b>
  use Chrome instead of Safari for the quiz.
 </b>
 We have confirmed this with Cornell IT.

 If you did somehow start taking the quiz in Safari and did run into this problem,
 <b>
  you can work around it in a way that doesn't lose any significant time on the quiz:
 </b>
 right click on the broken image icon, save the image, and open it up in Preview. But we recommend using Chrome anyway to avoid even this small hassle.
