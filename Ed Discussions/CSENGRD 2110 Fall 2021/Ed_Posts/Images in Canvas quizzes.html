  Some Canvas quizzes will have embedded images --e.g. pictures of inheritance diagrams.
  <bold>
   Mac users beware: there is a known bug in the interaction between Canvas and Safari,
  </bold>
  which can cause Safari not to display embedded images. The fix is easy:
  <bold>
   use Chrome instead of Safari for the quiz.
  </bold>
  We have confirmed this with Cornell IT.

 <paragraph>
  If you did somehow start taking the quiz in Safari and did run into this problem,
  <bold>
   you can work around it in a way that doesn't lose any significant time on the quiz:
  </bold>
  right click on the broken image icon, save the image, and open it up in Preview. But we recommend using Chrome anyway to avoid even this small hassle.
