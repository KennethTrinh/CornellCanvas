 I just want to make sure my reasoning for this answer is correct -- This is illegal because bâ€™s static value does not contain a partition to A, this results in a compile-time error.

  I don't know what a "static value" is. Do you mean the static type of b?
 </p>
 <p>
  At compiletime, only the types of expressions are used; values occur only at run time.
 </p>
 <p>
  So your reasoning is not quite right.
 </p>
 <p>
  The assignment-declaration   A a= b;  is illegal because for the assignment to work, the object must be cast down to A, and downward casts are not inserted automatically.
