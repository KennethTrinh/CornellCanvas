  I am generally confused about the Tile class. do we have any reason to need to know or use the TileType in the seek state?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  the isOpen() method seems useful when finding neighbors to move to but I am just confused how to construct a Tile as a parameter for a Node if I do not know the row, column, TileType, etc.

  Please read the long specification on McDiver.seek.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  One para. says ou know only your current tile's ID and the IDs
  <break>
  </break>
  of neighbor tiles to which McDiver can move, and distances to the ring.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The next para. tells you what functions you should be using:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  currentLocation(), neighbors(), and distanceToRing()
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  and in the next para.  moveTo(long id)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Concentrate on what that all means.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Also, read carefully the guidelines on writing seek that appear linked to from the
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Ed Discussion pinned note for A8.
