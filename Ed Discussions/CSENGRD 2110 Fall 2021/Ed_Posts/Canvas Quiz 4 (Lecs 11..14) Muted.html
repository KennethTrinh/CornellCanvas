  Hello, everyone! After taking Quiz 4, I was unable to see my score (like the problem we had with the first quiz on Canvas). It says my quiz is muted because the instructor has not finished grading it. Could the scores for the quiz please be made available so I can take a look at what I got wrong? Thank you!

  Apologies for this; you should be able to see your performance on your first submission now.
