  I have been trying to debug my code using the GUI provided to us, but using the seeds in the test files yields a different graph than one described in the file. (In most cases, the nodes are the same, but the edges have different values). Is this intentional, or are we supposed to be able to generate those graphs exactly using the GUI if we input the right seed?

  Please don't use the GUI to debug. Use it only at the end, when all tests cases have passed.
 </paragraph>

  Give me more information on the graphs being different so I can check.

  Sure. I have everything working except for a couple cases, so I was curious to visualize my function's behavior using the GUI and cross-reference to the testing output.

  But take, for instance, Seed16.txt. In the GUI pane, I select New Random Map and input the number 16 as the seed. The graph that is generated has the correct number and names of nodes in the correct locations, but some of the edge values are different. As an example, the .txt file states that the edge between PompanoBeach and Cleveland should have a weight of 15, but on the GUI it is 60.

  You are right. There is a discrepancy between the map generated randomly with the seed 16 and the map is Seed16.txt.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I cannot tell you when this discrepancy arose.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  At the moment, attempting to fix Seed16.txt to fix the discrepancy might cause other problems, and we will just have to leave it as is for this assignment.

  Next semester, if we use a similar assignment, I'll look into this issue and fix it.

  Thanks!
