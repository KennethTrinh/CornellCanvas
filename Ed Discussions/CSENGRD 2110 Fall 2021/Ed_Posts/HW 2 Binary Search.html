 Is this question just asking for the max number of comparisons to
 <i>
  find
 </i>
 the target, or is it asking for the total number of comparisons done by the binary search algorithm? I am unsure if I should count the one additional comparison made after the target is found.
</p>
<p>
 Thanks!

  You are being asked for the number done by the binary search algorithm in JavaHyperText.
