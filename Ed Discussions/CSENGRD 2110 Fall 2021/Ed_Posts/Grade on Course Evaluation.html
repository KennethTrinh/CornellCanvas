  On the grading notes on the course, it says that 0.5% of our grade is based on course evaluations.  I am a bit confused about that since I thought they were anonymous?

  For the course evaluation, we can see a list of people who completed it, but we don't get to see the anonymous evaluations until after the course is over and grades are in.
