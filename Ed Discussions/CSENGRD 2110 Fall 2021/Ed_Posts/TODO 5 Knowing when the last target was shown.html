 "if the last target for the current game has not yet been shown, ..."
</p>
<p>
 I guess I need to figure out a way to find out if the last target has been shown. Could I query the time that last target has been shown to tell me that (i.e t = 0) or is it easier than that?

  Review the fields that are maintained in
  <code>
   GameComponent
  </code>
  ; if you knew how many targets should be shown per game, as well as how many targets have been shown in the current game, could you answer your question?
