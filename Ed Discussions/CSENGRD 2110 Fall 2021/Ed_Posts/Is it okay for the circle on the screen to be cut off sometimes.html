 When the circle on my screen keeps moving randomly, sometimes part of the circle gets cut off or it goes underneath the start button or gets cut off on the left or right edges due to the other components. Is this okay, or should the full circle be visible at all times? Also, should the size of the circle remain constant even if the person changes the size of the window? In other words, d we have to consider the getHeight() or getWidth() methods for the size of the circle somehow?

  Yes, that happens. The center of the circle will always be in JPanel.
