 In TODO 2 answer, it says, 0 &lt;= idx &lt;=size.
</p>
<p>
 Why size but not size -1?
</p>
<p>
 Isn't b[size] out of boundary?
</p>
<p>
 Also in todo3, it says idx &lt; size; but if idx = size -1, b[size-1] is the last element, which doesn't have next value.
</p>

  I don't see the question so I cannot respond adequately. The comment on idx should explain. It may be that idx = size means that everything has been enumerated.
 </p>
 <p>
  But again, I don't see the questions.
