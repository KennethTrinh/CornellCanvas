  In TODO 2 answer, it says, 0 &lt;= idx &lt;=size.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Why size but not size -1?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Isn't b[size] out of boundary?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Also in todo3, it says idx &lt; size; but if idx = size -1, b[size-1] is the last element, which doesn't have next value.

  I don't see the question so I cannot respond adequately. The comment on idx should explain. It may be that idx = size means that everything has been enumerated.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  But again, I don't see the questions.
