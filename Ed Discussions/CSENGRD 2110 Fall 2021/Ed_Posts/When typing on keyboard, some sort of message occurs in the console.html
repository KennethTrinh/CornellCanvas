  Are you using KeyListener?  I do not think you are supposed to be using that.  The error seems to be associated with KeyListener, at least from what I can see when searching the internet for your error.

    Nope. I asked in OH and they said to wait for a professor to reply.

     I have no experience with that kind of message - nothing in the assignment code should produce it.  To diagnose, you could compare your environments (what operating system, what hardware vendor, what default language, what JDK, etc.), and then perhaps search the internet.  But it's not something that we can diagnose on a discussion board, I'm afraid.
