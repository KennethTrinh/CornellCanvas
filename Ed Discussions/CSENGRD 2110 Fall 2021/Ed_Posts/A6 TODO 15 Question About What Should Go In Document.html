  Hello! I just had a quick question about TODO 15. When we put the score value in the document, we should simply put the score's value on a new line, correct? Should we add any text with it, like "Your score is " or should we just print the score value (like 5)? Thank you for all of your help.

  Yes, just put the score. No text.
