  The initialization of v=b[n] assumes that the array is of size n+1 at the very least. Wouldn't we want to initialize v as b[0] and define it as the minimum of b[k..n]?

  The invariant is.  v = min of b[k..n] and 0 &lt;= k &lt;= n
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Variables v and k are to be initialized. To do this, you want the range k..n to be as small as possible: b[k..n] should contain ONE value, so k has to be n. Then b is b[n]. So the initialization is. k= n; v= b[n];
