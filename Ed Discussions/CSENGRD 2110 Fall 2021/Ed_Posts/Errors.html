 I've been trying to debug my code for a while now, and I'm not really sure which part of my algorithm I implemented wrong.

  That is difficult to say without information about the code.
 </p>
 <p>
  I suggest you read the handout again.
  <break>
  </break>
  Specifically, look at section
  <b>
   8. Suggestions for getting through A7 quickly
  </b>
  <break>
  </break>
  and especially the last part of that section, 4. Maintain the invariant!
 </p>
 <p>
  Not following that suggestion to maintain the invariant is often a source of error.
 </p>
 <p>
  Let us know if this helps.
