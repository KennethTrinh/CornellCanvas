 Hello!
</p>
<p>
 I realize I've been attending a discussion section that I am not registered in officially on student center but occurs the same as the one I'm officially registered in. Is it possible to stay in the one I have been attending even though the add period is over?

  If you want t stay in it, then change it officially.
 </p>
 <p>
  You should be in the section for which you are registered.
