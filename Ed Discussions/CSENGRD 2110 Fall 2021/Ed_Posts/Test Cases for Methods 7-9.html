  I do not see, in the testing document, any instruction that we need to add our own test cases for these methods on A5. Do we need to do this anyway?

  You must test ALL the methods appropriately.

  We put only one or two test cases in. YOU have to put in you own test cases. Based on all the instructions we gave you in earlier methods, we did not see the need for more guidance on testing.
