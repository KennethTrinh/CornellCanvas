 Is there a suggested timeline for working on A8 like with some previous assignments, given that we aim to get the average grade of 85?

  No, there is no suggested timeline. No need for it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just get the seek phase done soon --if you follow directions, it will be fairly easy.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the scram phase is even easier.
 </p>
 <p>
  Get them out of the way now.
