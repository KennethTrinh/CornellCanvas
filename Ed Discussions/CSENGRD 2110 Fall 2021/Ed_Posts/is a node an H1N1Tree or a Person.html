  in using the counting/searching template methods, in the case of A5, would a Node (per the template) refer to an H1N1Tree object or a Person? I am 99% sure it is an H1N1Tree, but still find the difference hard to conceptualize, so i just want to make sure

  The node who Person field contains Person P1.
