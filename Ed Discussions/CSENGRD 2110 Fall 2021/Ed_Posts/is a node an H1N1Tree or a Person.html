<p>
 in using the counting/searching template methods, in the case of A5, would a Node (per the template) refer to an H1N1Tree object or a Person? I am 99% sure it is an H1N1Tree, but still find the difference hard to conceptualize, so i just want to make sure

  A Node in an H1N1Tree object. Each H1N1Tree object contains a Person.
  <break>
  </break>
  The Person's in the Nodes of an H1N1Tree are all different.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since the Person's in the Nodes of an H1N1Tree are all different, we often abbreviate a long phrase by just saying Node P1 (if P1 is a Person) meaning
 </p>
 <p>
  The node who Person field contains Person P1.

  I hope this helps.
