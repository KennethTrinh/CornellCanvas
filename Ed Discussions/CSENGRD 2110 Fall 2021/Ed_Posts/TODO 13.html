  I added the sliders to the JPanel, and it appears on my screen, but the sliders do not extend all the way down to the bottom of the frame. I tried finding methods to extend sliders or increase the height of the JPanel itself but I was unable to. I'm not sure how to go about this

  The sizes of components in a panel are determined by a complex interaction between the Layout Manager and the preferred sizes of the components in the panel.  To get a component to fill all available space, you want to choose a LayoutManager with that functionality and then add the component with any required flags.

  For example, the CENTER region of BorderLayout will resize its contents to fill all available space, so adding the slider with the CENTER flag to a panel with a BorderLayout Layout Manager is one way to get the slider to fill the height.  Other layout managers have different ways to do this.
