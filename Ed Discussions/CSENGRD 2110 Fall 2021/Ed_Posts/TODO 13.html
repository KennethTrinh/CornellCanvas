 I added the sliders to the JPanel, and it appears on my screen, but the sliders do not extend all the way down to the bottom of the frame. I tried finding methods to extend sliders or increase the height of the JPanel itself but I was unable to. I'm not sure how to go about this

  The sizes of components in a panel are determined by a complex interaction between the Layout Manager and the preferred sizes of the components in the panel.  To get a component to fill all available space, you want to choose a LayoutManager with that functionality and then add the component with any required flags.
 </p>
 <p>
  For example, the CENTER region of BorderLayout will resize its contents to fill all available space, so adding the slider with the CENTER flag to a panel with a BorderLayout Layout Manager is one way to get the slider to fill the height.  Other layout managers have different ways to do this.
