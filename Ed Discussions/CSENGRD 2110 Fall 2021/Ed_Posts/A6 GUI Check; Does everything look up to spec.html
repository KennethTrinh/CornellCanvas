 Hello, everyone! I just quickly wanted to ask about the GUI that I have made for A6. Above I have put in a picture, and it looks very close to what is given in the assignment handout. However, my sliders look slightly different, and my start button is not blue like it is on the assignment handout. I just wanted see if this was difference between systems (Windows vs. Mac vs. Linux) or a problem with the way I coded the GUI. Which do you guys think it is? For reference, I am on a Mac system. Thank you for all of your help!
</p>

  Your GUI looks great!  The stylistic differences are expected on a Mac - the default "look-and-feel" of Swing on Macs is one that tries to emulate native applications, whereas on Windows and Linux, the default look-and-feel is the cross-platform "Ocean/Metal LaF".  It is possible to change the look-and-feel in code (see the Swing Tutorial, or the code in SwingSet2), but for this assignment, the default is fine.  Good work!

   This looks OK.

   It may have been blue in the demo because it was selected. Things turn blue when selected --look at your slider on the right.
