 I joined the Google Meet that was in the details on Canvas for Fausto's virtual office hours from 7-9pm, but no one is there. Is there a different link? Did he cancel his OHs and I didn't see it posted somewhere? I also tried to join an office hours Zoom link around 8pm but no one ever started it.

  Fausto is no longer a TA.
