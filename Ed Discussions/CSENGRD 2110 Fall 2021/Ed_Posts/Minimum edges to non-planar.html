 Is there a trick/formula that can be used to obtain this answer? I'm not too sure how to approach this question other than guess and check.

  The important part here is noticing how you can add edges to get one of the two subgraphs that will always be present in a nonplanar graph. In this case, it takes 3 edges to make this graph look like the K5 graph, which is nonplanar
