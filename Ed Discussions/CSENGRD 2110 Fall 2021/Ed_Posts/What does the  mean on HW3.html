  This might be a dumb question but what does the ? mean within the array on HW3? Is it indicating of an empty node?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For example, for Q3, when we add value 7 to the heap, does it replace one of the question marks?

  Read the assignment carefully. It is explained there.

  There is no such thing as an "empty node".
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Consider an array length 8 containing a heap of size 5.
  <break>
  </break>
  Here is an example:  (5 , 7, 6, 9, 8, ?, ?, ?)
  <break>
  </break>
  The heap is in the first 5 elements: 5, 7, 6, 9, 8.
  <break>
  </break>
  The rest of the array element contain values, but we don't care what they are.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  In such a notation, ? represents a value in the array that is not in the heap, and we don't care what the value is.
