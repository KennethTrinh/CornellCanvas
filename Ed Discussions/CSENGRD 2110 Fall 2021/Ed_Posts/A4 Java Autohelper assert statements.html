  Hello, after submitting our A4, we received the following message from Java Autohelper:

  After removing the assert statements for getNode and resubmitting, we didn't receive an error. Would this be due to an issue on our end with the code, or with the evaluation system maybe not running the assert statements? Thank you!

  I had a same problem, the assert statements are at constant time so I don't see an issue with using them

  I am assuming this feedback was for your version of
  <code>
   DListTest
  </code>
  .  What it is saying is that your test was expecting an AssertionError to be thrown under some conditions, but our reference implementation of
  <code>
   DList
  </code>
  did not throw such an error.

 <paragraph>
  Look carefully at the specifications for
  <code>
   DList
  </code>
  - does it ever specify a situation in which it will throw an
  <code>
   AssertionError
  </code>
  ?  If not, then you should not be testing for such behavior.

  We handled this a little differently for A1; see

  #435 for a discussion.
