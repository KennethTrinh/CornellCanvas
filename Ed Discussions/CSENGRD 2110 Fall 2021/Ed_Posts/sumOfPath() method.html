  Are we required to make use of the sumOfPath() method? I have written dijkstra() without using it by just following the abstract algorithm, but I could probably backtrack and incorporate it if not using it means losing points on this assignment.

  You don't have to use it. It's just there because it may be useful in your next assignment.
