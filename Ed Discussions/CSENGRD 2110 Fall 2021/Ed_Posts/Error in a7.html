  I looked through my error message and there is no mention of A7.java. Does that mean that the code is failing due to one of the other files?

  Sorry, I did not copy the data so that was the problem.

  I meant that the red messages never mentioned anything about A7.java , so I was wondering if I could take that as a sign that the code is failing before it even gets to what I was writing. It turned out to be true but maybe it was just a coincidence.

  You did not show us the error message in full. If you did, we might be able to show you how to read it, how to interpret it, and what it might say about the error.
