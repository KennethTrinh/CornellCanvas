 I am trying to use a compound boolean expression, but the "unnecessary parentheses" are being removed, thereby preventing the expression from evaluating properly. I assume disabling the format isn't a good idea. How can I make eclipse keep the parentheses?

  I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience, I have since realized that a separate assert statement was causing the issue (misread 156 as 165).

   Do not disable the formatting conventions.
  </p>
  <p>
   If the parentheses are being removed, that means that they are unnecessary. Thus, the expression is being evaluated as YOU wrote it with parentheses. This means, perhaps, that your expression is incorrect.

   In what method is this --either of the two Boolean functions isOlder and areSIblings?
