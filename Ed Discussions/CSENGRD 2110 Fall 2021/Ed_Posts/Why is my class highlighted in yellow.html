 When I run my JUnit test case, everything works, but in my main java file, my class is highlighted in yellow. It says that there is 1 of 2 branches missed. Additionally, when testing assert statements, although I tested every individual case when an assertion exception will be thrown, it still says that branches were missed. What can I do to fix this?

  Don't worry if the class declaration line is highlighted yellow.
