  Is the assumption that the graph is a directed one for investigating the execution time, or for the algorithm to work? (I think the algorithm should work whether it is directed or not but the execution time would change. I want to make sure I am not missing something) .

  You can use this version of the algorithm to investigate the time for an undirected graph or a directed graph. The main difference is that for an indirect graph an edge will be processed twice --once in each direction-- while for a directed graph an edge will be processed once.
