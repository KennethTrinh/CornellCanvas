  So I was watching some of the videos, and in the first one the man said "Because class main has a procedure that's static and called main, and has this parameter, it's called an application." are procedure and static specific JAVA terms, or does this just mean static as in 'what happens in the body doesn't vary, so it's static?' And follow-up- what is the significance of the parameter?

  and type     procedure     into the Filter Field to see what that word means.

  1. No, it is not specific to Java, it just means an method/subroutine that does not return a result but just does something, as opposed to a function, which returns a value.

  2. Please don't be concerned with the keyword "static" at this point. It will be explained at the proper time, in a few lectures. There's a lot going on; we can't explain everything immediately.

  3. In the same way, don't be concerned about the parameter at this point.
