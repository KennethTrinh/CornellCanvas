 For the Scram phase, I am writing a version of the shortest-path algorithm that returns a HashMap rather than a List (as in the A7.java dijkstra method).
</p>
<p>
 Am I allowed to add another method to A7.java, or should I add it to McDiver.java?  If I do the latter, I would need to copy the private class Item into McDiver.
</p>
<p>
 In other words, are we submitting A7.java along with McDiver.java?
</p>

  You can put anything you want in the package that you will submit.

   You will be submitting a zip file of package diver which would include A7, so yes you will be submitting A7.java for A8.
