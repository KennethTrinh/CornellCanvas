 After these days study on data structures and algorithms, I find loop invariants so concise yet powerful that it can even develop a shortest path algorithm easily.
</p>
<p>
 And I just start to wonder is there any higher logic behind it? Why can loop invariants be applied to so many algorithms? I mean we did have a lot of practice on it but I'm curious, if I take a step back, what is it essentially? Is is related to mathematics? And how would people develop and express their thoughts before the invention of loop invariants?
</p>
<p>
 Thank you!

  I'm happy that you see loop invariants as concise and yet powerful.

  Yes, they are related to mathematics, to logic. There are now mechanical theorem provers use a formal definition of "proof" to prove thousands of theorems in mathematics --about programs.

  Before people invented a formal proof theory for programs, some people would think unconsciously about an invariant of a loop. Tony Hoare wrote the first paper that gave a proof theory for programs, "An axiomatic basis for computer programming" in 1969. Search and you could probably find a copy of it and actually read it.

  I JavaHyperText, there is somewhere a paper that Edsger Dijkstra published in about 1959 about his shortest path algorithm and also Prim's minimum spanning tree algorithm (in two lectures). Look at his description of the shortest path algorithm and you can see that he was thinking in terms of a loop invariant, though that term wouldn't coined for another ten years.
