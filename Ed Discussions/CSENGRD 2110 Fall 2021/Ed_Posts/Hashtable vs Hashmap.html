 JHT has an entry for Hashtable, but we've also been using Hashmaps for A7. I'm wondering what the difference between these two data structures are? Thank you!

  In a generic context, a "hash table" can refer to an implementation of either the Set or the Map abstract data type based on hashing keys (the topic of next Tuesday's lecture).  Whether or not values are paired with keys (Map vs. Set) is of minor importance compared to the general strategy of using hash codes.

 <p>
  In the Java standard library,
  <code>
   HashSet
  </code>
  and
  <code>
   HashMap
  </code>
  are classes implementing the
  <code>
   Set
  </code>
  and
  <code>
   Map
  </code>
  interfaces, respectively.
  <code>
   Hashtable
  </code>
  (which did make an appearance in A6) is also an implementation of the
  <code>
   Map
  </code>
  interface, but it dates from Java 1.0 (before that interface was even defined; it was retrofitted to support it).
  <code>
   Hashtable
  </code>
  differs from
  <code>
   HashMap
  </code>
  in some of its concurrency properties (also a topic for next week); in that sense, it is analogous to
  <code>
   Vector
  </code>
  vs.
  <code>
   ArrayList
  </code>
  .  We tend not to use these legacy Java 1.0 classes unless they're needed for compatibility reasons;
  <code>
   HashSet
  </code>
  ,
  <code>
   HashMap
  </code>
  , and
  <code>
   ArrayList
  </code>
  all have clearer names.

   A set is a bunch of distinct values.
  </p>
  <p>
   A map is a bunch of pairs, say (key, value)
  </p>
  <p>
   A Hashtable is a special implementation of a set.
  </p>
  <p>
   A HashMap is a special implementation of a map.
