 When I navigate to my eclipse-workspace in Finder (I used Mac) and try to drag the .java file from the folder to my Desktop so I can upload it, the file disappears from Eclipse. How can I upload the .java file and have my work remain in Eclipse?

  If I understand you correctly, you are currently
  <i>
   moving
  </i>
  your files out of your Eclipse workspace and onto your desktop.  Here are some alternatives:
 </p>
 <list style="bullet">
  <li>
   <p>
    Upload the file directly from your Eclipse workspace directory.  There should be no need for the file to live on your Desktop to be able to upload it.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    If you really want it on your Desktop, you can copy-paste the file there using keyboard shortcuts, right-click options, or menu options.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    There may also be a modifier key you can hold while clicking-and-dragging to make a copy.  On Windows, you can hold "Control" when dragging to do this, or you can right-click drag to get a menu of options, including "move" and "copy".  Classmates, feel free to chime in if you know the equivalent options on a Mac.
   </p>
  </li>

    If you're comfortable with Terminal commands, you can use
    <code>
     cp
    </code>
    instead of
    <code>
     mv
    </code>
    .
   </p>
  </li>
 </list>
 <p>
  I recommend the first option, but it's good to be comfortable with a range of different ways of interacting with your computer.
