 From the study guide, I learnt that hashing is not on the prelim. Can I know if HashSet is on the prelim 2? Thank you!

  HashSet its just an implementation of a set using a HashTable.

  It's fair game to have a HashSet on the prelim. You don't have to know anything about how to implement it, just how to use it.
