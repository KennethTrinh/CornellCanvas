  My game appears to work, however in the way that I have written TODO 7, the "hit" area is actually a square around the circle bounded by the circle's radius on the coordinate plane. Is there a way to make this more accurate or is this sufficient for our purposes?

  I had the same problem initially, but I fixed it by remembering that a point (x,y) is in a circle C with center (h,k) if (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 &lt;= radius^2

  You should think about the mathematical equality to check whether an x-point and a y-point are at most one-radius away from the center of the circle.  Write the equality on paper and then implement it.
