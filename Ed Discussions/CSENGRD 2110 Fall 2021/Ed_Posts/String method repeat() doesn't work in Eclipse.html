  I checked both the JDK and JRE versions on Eclipse, but I still get an error where repeat(int) is undefined. Is there anything else I can check?

  Have you set your Eclipse Compile Preferences to Java 11?

  I changed it. It was originally 1.8 for the project specifically, but 11 for Eclipse. Thanks for the help!
