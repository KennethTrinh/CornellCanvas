  If we need to prove that some function f(n) is O(g(n)) do we need to find the exact N where for all n&gt;N c*g(n) &gt;= f(n) or can we just put some arbitrarily large value.

  Would it be acceptable to prove it:

  Let c = 2 and N = 10000 (or any other sufficiently large number), when n &gt; N: 2n + 2 &lt;= 2n^2 - 2 = 2 * (n^2 - 1)
