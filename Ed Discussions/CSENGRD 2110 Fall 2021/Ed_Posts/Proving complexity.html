 If we need to prove that some function f(n) is O(g(n)) do we need to find the exact N where for all n&gt;N c*g(n) &gt;= f(n) or can we just put some arbitrarily large value.

 For instance, this question on a practice prelim

 Would it be acceptable to prove it:
</p>
<p>
 Let c = 2 and N = 10000 (or any other sufficiently large number), when n &gt; N: 2n + 2 &lt;= 2n^2 - 2 = 2 * (n^2 - 1)

  There is no such ting as an exact N. Any N will do as long as the proof is right.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sometimes, choosing a different N will lead to a different proof.
