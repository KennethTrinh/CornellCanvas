  In the documentation for method createAndShowGUI() it says that size slider is on the right and speed slider is on the left, but in the given code the size slider is put in BorderLayout.WEST and speed slider in BorderLayout.EAST. Just making sure, but we shouldn't touch the code that is given to us? Thanks!
