  Is there going to be a post where we can post our scores for A8 maps to engage in a little friendly competition?  Or maybe an editable Google Sheet?

  Personally, I beat Prof. Gries by almost 7000 points on seed 3155001427459142166 from his Panopto demo, and it would be cool to compare with others.

  It's supposed to be #1124. But I don't know whether you can edit it since an instructor created it. If you could create a note for posting scores, with a table as kind of explained in #1124, that would be great. Once there, I can add some text to help people.
