 I completed the quiz before the deadline and I submitted by SDS accommodations to the course staff, but I've had no communication about where and when the extra time prelim is going to be at. Is there somewhere I should check about this info?
</p>
<p>
 Thanks in advance!!

  Please just go to your assigned room. Identify yourself as a person with extended time before the prelim starts. When the session ends, go with the staff to whichever room they are going. This gives you a break. And finish the exam there.

   It should be under the comments section of your room assignment on CMS.
