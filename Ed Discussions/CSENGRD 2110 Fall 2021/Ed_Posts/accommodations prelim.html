  I completed the quiz before the deadline and I submitted by SDS accommodations to the course staff, but I've had no communication about where and when the extra time prelim is going to be at. Is there somewhere I should check about this info?

  Thanks in advance!!

  It should be under the comments section of your room assignment on CMS.

  Please just go to your assigned room. Identify yourself as a person with extended time before the prelim starts. When the session ends, go with the staff to whichever room they are going. This gives you a break. And finish the exam there.
