  By the Compile-time Reference Rule (PLEASE LEARN IT!), from a variable of (static) type Animal, one cannot reference methods that are declared only in Cat.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, if you know the object pointed at has a Cat partition, you can cast it down to Cat and then reference the methods.

   What if the variable has a static type of Cat but then is cast to an Animal? Then can the new Animal object still reference Cat's methods?

    I believe when you cast it to an Animal, you have to define a new variable with static type Animal that points to the object. You can then use the compile-type reference rule from there.
