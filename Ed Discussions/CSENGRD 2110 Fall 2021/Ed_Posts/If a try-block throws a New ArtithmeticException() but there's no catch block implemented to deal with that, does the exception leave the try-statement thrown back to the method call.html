 Title: If a try-block throws a "New ArtithmeticException()" but there's no catch block implemented to deal with that, does the exception leave the try-statement thrown back to the method call?

 I am curious what would happen if a catch-block was not implemented to deal with a certain exception

   Since there's no catch block to catch the thrown ArithmeticException, the Arithmetic Exception will be thrown to the call of whatever method implements the try statement.
