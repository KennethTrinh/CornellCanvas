 The instructions for A1 in creating Javadoc comments says, "itâ€™s best to copy and paste these descriptions to create the first draft of your Javadoc comments." Since it mentions "first draft," does this mean we are expected to modify the Javadoc documentations on each method throughout the process of this assignment?

  It's up to you. If there are problems with the way it looks, fix. But the content of those specs is exactly what should be there.
