 I saw a post at #1339 about why insertion for a LinkedList is O(1). When I think about this we're only thinking about act of inserting between two nodes, but not the process of searching for the node we want to insert after or before (the search is O(n)).

 Thanks

  If such things arise on the test, we will try to be clear which of the two cases you mention is being discussed, e.g.
 </p>
 <p>
  ... to insert an element after node n ...
 </p>
 <p>
  OR ... to insert an element after node number k ...
 </p>
