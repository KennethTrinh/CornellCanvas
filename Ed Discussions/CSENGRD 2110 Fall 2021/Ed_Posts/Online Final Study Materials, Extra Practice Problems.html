 In preparation for the original final, I went through every final exam on Canvas and solved them. However, because I'm taking the online one I was wondering if anyone had suggestions for more practice problems, since I'd prefer to test new scenarios as opposed to the same questions (I'd like to get an answer right because I know how to do it, not because I've seen the answer before). Would it be worthwhile to go over the Prelim 2 and 1 past tests again, or is there someplace else I can find practice problems?

  While practice problems are helpful to make the exam environment feel more familiar, to really internalize the material you need hands-on experience.  So our recommendation would be to
  <b>
   practice writing programs
  </b>
  at this point.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pick a past exam problem that you had some trouble with, and write a program to illustrate the concepts being tested.  Then tweak the program in various ways and see what changes.  Thoroughly analyze it so that you can predict what will happen when you make particular tweaks.  Then pick another, unrelated problem, and repeat.
 </p>
 <p>
  As you identify patterns, think of which definitions or rules in JHT govern them, and see if you can state those rules in your own words.  This form of analytical and reflective thinking should solidify the material much better than answering disconnected test problems.

   Follow-up tip: find ways to
   <i>
    visualize
   </i>
   what your programs are doing as they run.  Adding lots of
   <code>
    println
   </code>
   statements is an easy way to do this.  Compare the results to what you thought it would do (which you should have written down or diagrammed on a piece of paper first).  Work with small (exam-sized) test cases to keep this tractable.  Visualization is always an effective study aid for any subject.

    Would it be safe to expect that this online format will rely more on algorithmic implementation and theory, rather than rote memorization?

   <p>
    Paper exams seem to have been a combination, but how will online be different?

    Thanks!

     A proctored online exam would be very similar to a paper exam.
    </p>
    <p>
     An open-note online exam would be adjusted as you say - questions that exercised memorization and definitions would be replaced by questions requiring higher-level reasoning and synthesis of ideas.  But the overall style of test would be familiar.
