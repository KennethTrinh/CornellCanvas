 </i>

 The department is interviewing potential new faculty to teach your courses, so we want to know what you think of them!  Today's mock lecture is on Recursion - a topic very relevant to CS 2110.  We'd love to have many of you attend, both to learn and to provide feedback.  Thank of it as an alternative to discussion sections this week.  Hope to see you there!
