  Looking at the AutoHelper logs, it still appears to be testing submissions and sending e-mail responses when the submitter's submission limit hasn't been exceeded.
 </p>
 <p>
  The AutoHelper will only look at a few submissions per student per day.  If you submit more than that, you will not get any further responses via e-mail until the next day.
 </p>
 <p>
  The AutoHelper isn't meant to be a remote debugging tool.  It's more of a sanity check that you followed the submission instructions correctly.  If it indicates an error, try to figure out what might be causing it by re-reading the directions and checking the common mistakes in the pinned note.  If you are unable to find a discrepancy, ask a consultant for assistance.  Repeatedly guessing-and-checking is unlikely to build understanding here in the same way that systematically examining your code will.
