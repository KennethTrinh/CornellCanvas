  Problem #4 of rec1 problem set says to return the long form of the date, but shouldn't the long form be "28 August 2018" instead of "28 August 2000" because the method call is dateToString(28,8,2018). I'm not sure if it's a typo.

  Yes, that's looks like a mistake.

  Don't be too concerned with things like this. We are not going to grade the recitation work for complete, accuracy. We only want you to do the best you can. Recitation work is there to give you practice, that is the main aim.
