 I was following the abstract algorithm for A7 and came across a little trouble here:
</p>
<p>
 f= node in F with minimum d value;
</p>
<p>
 Remove f from F, add it to S;
</p>
<p>
 After removing f from F (the frontier minheap), I was not able to figure out a way to add its Item to S (the hashmap) as I am not sure where to find values for the fields backpointer or distance from the start node in the item class. This means I know the key for the hashmap, but not what item to assign to the associated value for the key.
</p>
<p>
 Does anyone have suggestions?

  Then, if the node is already in the HashMap, why are your trying to add it again?

   Again, what nodes are in the HashMap, and for a node in the HashMap, what is the corresponding value in the HashMap?

    The nodes in the hashmap are nodes from S and F.
   </p>
   <p>
    For a node in the HashMap, the corresponding value is an Item which contains information about the distance from the start node to this node and a backpointer on the shortest path from start node to this one.
   </p>

    Please remember that S, the d-array, and the back pointer array are replaced by a HashMap.
   </p>
   <p>
    Exactly what nodes are in that HashMap? Once you understand that thoroughly --and place a suitable comment on the Hashmap-- you should be able to determine what, if anything, has to be done about "add it to S".

     The HashMap should contain an entry for each node in S and F. However, I still don't understand how to add f's associated "Item" to the HashMap after removing it from the frontier min heap. As in, I don't know where to find the values for the distance and backpointer fields to add these Items.
