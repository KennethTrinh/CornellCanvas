 I know the directions say that we can't use method contains(p) in method depth, but can we use method node(p)?

  WHY do you think it is a counting method? When figuring it out, do NOT look at the return type. that has nothing to do with it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Should this method look at all nodes? Or is it looking for a particular node and stopping when it finds it?

   I took a look at the PDFs again and I realize now that it is a searching method because it looks for a particular node and stops when it finds it.  I have figured the method out; thanks for helping me!

   No, that too is an unnecessary traversal.
  </p>
  <p>
   Have you figured out what kind of method this is --counting or searching?
  </p>
  <p>
   What is it? Once you determine that, make you method have that pattern.
  </p>
  <p>
   What does calling depth(p) recursively on a child give you?

    I think that it is a counting method.  I have tried making the method with that pattern but I am running into issues.  Calling depth(p) recursively on a child gives you the depth of p in that child.
   </p>
   <p>
    I am just having trouble getting the sum to not accumulate for children that do not have p in any of its children.
