 While testing TODO5, we found that our games run for 13-14 seconds rather than 15. Is this indicative of a problem?

  This could be indicative of a problem, but it would be helpful to get some more targeted diagnostics, such as:
 </p>
 <list style="bullet">
  <li>
   <p>
    Does your game show 10 different targets?
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Is each target shown for about the same duration?
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Do the targets respawn faster and slower when you adjust the speed slider?
   </p>
  </li>
 </list>
 <p>
  (as written, these rely on later TODOs, but you could also investigate them with print statements or manually calling functions).  If these diagnostics look good, then your program is probably fine; Swing timers are not particularly high-precision, and iirc, they do not preserve phase if an event is late.  But if your games are short because you are only showing 9 targets and not 10, that is a problem.
