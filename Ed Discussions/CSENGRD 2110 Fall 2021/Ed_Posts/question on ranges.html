  In the java hyper text they gave this example :
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  b[0..h-1] ≤ 0 (meaning that every element of b[0..h-1] is at most zero)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  does this mean h can only equal 0 or 1? because anything greater would make the statement untrue and anything lower would make it b[0...-2] which isn't allowed?

  Suppose the array has length 5 and is (0, -1, 0, 8, 8).
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Suppose h is 3. Then b[0..h-1], or b[0..2] is the array segment consisting of the first three elements and b[0..h-1] ≤ 0 is true, since the first three array elements are 0, -1, 0.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Suppose h is 4. Then b[0..h-1], or b[0..3] is the array segment consisting of the first four elements and b[0..h-1] ≤ 0 is false, since b[3], which is 8, is not &lt;= 0.
