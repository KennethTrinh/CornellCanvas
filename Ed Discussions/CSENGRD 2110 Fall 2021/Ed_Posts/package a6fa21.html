  Yes indeed. You must have it in the proper package.
 </p>
 <p>
  If not, big deduction because we have to manually change your code in order to grade.
 </p>
 <p>
  Wait! You can use Eclipse's refactoring tool to do this!
 </p>
 <p>
  1. In the Package Explorer Pane in Eclipse, select the package.
 </p>
 <p>
  2. Right mouse click. In the pop-down pane that opens, use menu item
  <break>
  </break>
  Refactor -&gt; Rename
 </p>
 <p>
  3. In the window that opens, change the "New name" to what your want and click OK.
 </p>
 <p>
  Use this feature to change the name of anything --a class, a parameter, a method, whatever. Eclipse takes care of making the change everywhere.
