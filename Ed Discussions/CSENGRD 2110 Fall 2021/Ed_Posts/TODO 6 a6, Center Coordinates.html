 In the field for x and y of the target, it says that the x and y are of the center, but the fillOval  method takes coordinates of the top left corner. Are we supposed to adjust the x and y before using them in the fillOval method?

  No, don't adjust them. They are what they are, the center of the dot to be drawn.

  But in fillOval, you have to use what that method specifies.

   Okay, so from what I understand. We should recalculate the points for fillOval in the paintDot method?

    Yes, you may need to do some math in order to compute the appropriate inputs to whatever
    <code>
     Graphics
    </code>
    method(s) you choose to call.
