  my save dialog for TODO15 does not look exactly like what's shown on the assignment handout. I am just wondering if mine looks correct.

  (On the handout, the dialog also has a box for File Name but mine doesn't)

  I think they use Linux in the A6 handout example.  Seems like "Save As: " in your picture is equivalent to "File Name: "?  This might just be a difference in operating systems as they both have different file dialogues.  Mine also looks like yours in the picture.  Also note, when you click on a file, the file name will be displayed as "Save As: [insert file name here]"

  On Macs, the native look-and-feel is used by default, rather than the cross-platform "Ocean/Metal" look-and-feel that is the default on Linux and Windows.  This is okay - as long as you see a "save file" dialog, it meets the specifications.  It doesn't need to look pixel-for-pixel identical, since operating systems are all a bit different.
