  I am lookin at problem 8 in part 2 of the F19 5:30 exam, and I am confused how I1 i1 = b; compiles. I thought you are not able to make an instance of an interface, or does this only apply to abstract classes?

  I1 i1 = b; is not creating a new instance of interface, it points to b. i1.getClass() would return class B. I2 i2 = (I2) i1; would allow you to use methods in I2 in i2 even though you can't use them in i1. It's all still that same object that b points to. They're not interface objects.

  Creating a new instance of an interface would be like "new I1();" but that is illegal.
