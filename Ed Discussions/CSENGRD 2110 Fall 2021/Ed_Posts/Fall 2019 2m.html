  The answer says that Java will not let you execute a synchronized method on multiple threads simultaneously. However, isn't that not true in a non-static environment? For example, this code produces a number between 10000 and 20000 because each thread references itself when checking for synchronization, which means that despite being a synchronized method, increment() runs on two threads simultaneously.

  It looks like synchronized keyword specifies that the method is synchronized on an object instead of a class. In the code above, each thread does not reference itself. They reference the class. Thus, the expected locking behavior is missing.

  Yes, as the student said, synchronization is always on an object, not a class.

  Is the object in this case the thread that increment() is being called from?
