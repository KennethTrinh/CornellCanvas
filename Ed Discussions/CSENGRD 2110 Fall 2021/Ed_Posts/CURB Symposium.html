 Hello undergrads! It's time for Cornell's Annual Fall Forum research presentation, and we're so excited to see all the amazing work you've put forward as a part of your research group. Fall Forum will be held virtually and will give you a chance to present your work to other students and our panel of judges. If you wish to participate, please sign up using the link in the attached graphic. Thank you!"
