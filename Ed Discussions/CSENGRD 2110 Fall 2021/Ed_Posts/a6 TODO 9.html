   Start with TODO 9 in GameMain for showing the score in the score label. As with TODO 3, the work to be performed should be specified in an anonymous function, which is passed to a method of the object that will be generating the events (in this case, the GameComponent game). Search the documentation for that object’s superclasses to find an appropriate method; look for an overload that will only listen for changes to the “GameScore” property. "

  I don't quite understand the part "which is passed to a method of the object that will be generating the events".  I thought that "the object" was GameComponent game, but it sounds like it's something else. Could I get some more clarity about this part?

  If
  <code>
   game
  </code>
  refers to the object generating "GameScore" events, then
  <code>
   game
  </code>
  is what you should invoke the method on.  (Apologies for the awkward wording here; it was meant to be a hint for where you should look for the relevant method.)
