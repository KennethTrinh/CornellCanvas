  I remember hearing that k + 1 - h came from from the follower - first concept.

  Is it analogous to say then that the reason we're expecting at max k + 1 - h swaps because k + 1 - h = all the elements of the array that we'll potentially need to move from one position to another?

  Yes, there are k+1-h elements in b[h..k].

  Take a look at the partition algorithm. Depending on how you write it, each iteration of the partition algorithm may make one swap.

  One CAN make it more complicated and have each swap put TWO elements in place. But that's still O(k+1-h).
