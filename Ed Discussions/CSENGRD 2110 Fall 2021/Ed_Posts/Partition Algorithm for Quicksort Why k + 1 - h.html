 I remember hearing that k + 1 - h came from from the follower - first concept.
 <break>

 Is it analogous to say then that the reason we're expecting at max k + 1 - h swaps because k + 1 - h = all the elements of the array that we'll potentially need to move from one position to another?

 <p>
  Yes, there are k+1-h elements in b[h..k].
 </p>
 <p>
  Take a look at the partition algorithm. Depending on how you write it, each iteration of the partition algorithm may make one swap.
 </p>
 <p>
  One CAN make it more complicated and have each swap put TWO elements in place. But that's still O(k+1-h).
