  I get that Java inserts a default constructor in a class if another one isn't already define, but when super() is call where is super() found? Is it found in the Object class?

  Suppose  B extends A.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Suppose B does not have a constructor, so Java inserts  super();
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  That calls a constructor with no parameters in A. A doesn't have such a constructor, it is a syntax error, and the program is not compiled.
