  I am still a little confused about the implementation of class Elephant's preconditions. For example, are we supposed to check/assert that the instantiated Elephant's birth year is greater than 2000, or assume that the user knows they must put a number greater than 2000?

  Please, if you have a question about A1, look in #105 first.
