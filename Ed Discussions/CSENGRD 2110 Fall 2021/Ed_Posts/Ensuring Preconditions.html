 I am still a little confused about the implementation of class Elephant's preconditions. For example, are we supposed to check/assert that the instantiated Elephant's birth year is greater than 2000, or assume that the user knows they must put a number greater than 2000?

  Look at item 3 in Note #105, Assignment A1.
 </p>
 <p>
  Please, if you have a question about A1, look in #105 first.
