 I guess I'm kind of confused as to why equals() is automatically included as an abstract method in C1. Only B implements C1, so I understand why B has to redeclare all methods in C1, but why would C1 have to redeclare methods in class Object?

  In an interface, all methods declared in superest class Object are automatically included.
 </p>

  That is just how it is defined.
