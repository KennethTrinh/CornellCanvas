 Since the return type is List, how can I keep using it as a linked list during the recursion?
</p>
<p>
 Also, I am confused about the spec "But List is an interface, so use something that implements it."
</p>

  Why are you confused about it?
 </p>
 <p>
  You know that List is a interface. What implements it? There are two that we use all the time. Look them up in the API document for List.

   I mean, are we supposed to cast the return object of H1N1RouteTo into LinkedList&lt;Person&gt; in the recursive case so that we can keep using it as a LinkedList ( esp using addFirst() method )?
  </p>
  <p>
   This is what I do but I find it weird.
  </p>
  <p>
   Thanks.

    You can't cast a person into a list, but you can add a person to a list.

     To clarify, in the recursive case, the return value of calling H1N1RouteTo is a List type. In order to use methods like addFirst(), I have to cast that List into LinkedList. It that correct?
    </p>

     Thanks.

      Yes you need to cast to ensure correct compile time behavior.
