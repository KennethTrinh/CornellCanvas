  Since the return type is List, how can I keep using it as a linked list during the recursion?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Also, I am confused about the spec "But List is an interface, so use something that implements it."

  Why are you confused about it?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  You know that List is a interface. What implements it? There are two that we use all the time. Look them up in the API document for List.

  I mean, are we supposed to cast the return object of H1N1RouteTo into LinkedList&lt;Person&gt; in the recursive case so that we can keep using it as a LinkedList ( esp using addFirst() method )?

 <paragraph>
  This is what I do but I find it weird.

  Thanks.

  You can't cast a person into a list, but you can add a person to a list.

  To clarify, in the recursive case, the return value of calling H1N1RouteTo is a List type. In order to use methods like addFirst(), I have to cast that List into LinkedList. It that correct?

  Yes you need to cast to ensure correct compile time behavior.
