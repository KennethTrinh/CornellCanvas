  When will the A4 submission be available on CMS? Or does submitting to the autograder also do that for me?

  Apologies - the "A4-linked lists" assignment was accidentally hidden on CMS.  It should now be visible.  You should upload your final submission to that assignment, not the AutoHelper one.
