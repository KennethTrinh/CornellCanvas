 What are the ranges of numerical grades for which each letter grade is assigned to? On the Canvas page, it says the cutoffs will be decided at the end. But, what are the general ranges for grades for this class?

   Does this mean the grade for this class is curved?

    This class is not curved in the formal sense of the word. We do not use statistics --means and standard deviations-- to ensure that only a certain number of people get each letter grade. That would be unfair. Everyone who does A work should get an A.

    The instructors look at the grades and determine where the cutoffs for each letter should be, based on how well the class did. But it is not formally curved.
