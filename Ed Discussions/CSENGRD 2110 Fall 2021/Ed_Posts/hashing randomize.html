 Why does the hash function need to be randomized? what is the relationship between the load factor and probing time and randomization?
</p>
<list style="ordered">
 <li>
  <p>
   the results of hashing are randomly distributed. If not, the expected probing time, for example, would not be constant when the load factor is 1‚ÅÑ2.
  </p>
 </li>
</list>
<p>
 Confused about this explanation in sp15
</p>
<p>
 Thanks

  "Randomized" is perhaps not the best word to use here (since hash functions need to be deterministic).  More precisely, hash codes should be
  <b>
   uniformly distributed
  </b>
  over the space of hash values for any set of keys (that is, for any key, its hash code should be equally likely to be any number in -2^31..2^31-1).  The assumption of uniformly distributed hash codes is needed to justify the averaging done in the complexity analysis - we needed to assume that a requested key was equally likely to be assigned to any bucket.
 </p>
 <p>
  For example, if all keys mapped to the same hash code, then they would all be in the same bucket, and lookups would degenerate to a linear search - O(N).  It's still true that the "average" chain length (including all the empty buckets) is equal to the load factor, but if keys haver 0 chance of mapping to an empty bucket, then this average is meaningless for the purpose of complexity analysis.
