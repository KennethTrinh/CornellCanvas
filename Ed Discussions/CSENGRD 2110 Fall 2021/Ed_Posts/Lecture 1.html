  1. You will see later that class types can be "extended" --in a way, you can add new operations to them in a subclass. Please wait for more information on this until you know about subclasses.

  2. A CPU is the "central processing unit". It is the part of the computer hardware that executes instructions, say to add, multiply, test whether something is true, etc. For Java primitive type
  <b>
   int
  </b>
  , operation + is defined exactly the way the CPU carries out instruction +.
