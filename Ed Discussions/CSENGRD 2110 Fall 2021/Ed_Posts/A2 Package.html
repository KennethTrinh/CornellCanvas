  When compiling code we need to specify a package or else the code will not compile. I do not see a specific package or name that we should use, is there one that is required or beneficial?

  The two files we gave you do not have a package statement at the top.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Therefore, they should be placed in the default package. After you have started a new project for A2, copy the two files, place your mouse over  the directory  src   in the project, and paste.

  Or, drag them from your hard drive window to   src   and release.
