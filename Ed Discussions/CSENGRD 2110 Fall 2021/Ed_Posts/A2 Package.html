 When compiling code we need to specify a package or else the code will not compile. I do not see a specific package or name that we should use, is there one that is required or beneficial?

  The two files we gave you do not have a package statement at the top.
 </p>
 <p>
  Therefore, they should be placed in the default package. After you have started a new project for A2, copy the two files, place your mouse over  the directory  src   in the project, and paste.
 </p>
 <p>
  Or, drag them from your hard drive window to   src   and release.
