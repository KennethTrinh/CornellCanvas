 Hello, I cannot figure out if we were supposed to use remove somewhere in our code or not? Is it just there as an example, or were we supposed to use remove in implementing one of our methods? Thanks

  No, you don't have to do remove.
 </p>
 <p>
  We wrote it to reduce the amount of work you have to do for this assignment.

  And if you study it, you can learn how it works.
