 Sorry to ask one last question (I want to make sure I clear any confusion here as opposed to through the regrading system). For question 4b, I don't understand if the answer weren't casted to an Entrant what does it return?
</p>
<p>
 I know s contains a set of Entrants, but does s.toArray(&lt;some #&gt;) return something of type Array?
</p>

  In the prelim, the question tells you what it returns. Four methods are briefly specified.

  </break>
  One is toArray(). The return type given is Object[] .

   You can answer his question yourself by searching for the method in the API Documentation. Look up Interface Set and read what it says, search for method toArray(...) and see what it says. Please report back so everyone else can learn what you learn.

    The function will return an element of type Object[] unless you explicitly cast it to be an Entrant? :/

    Thank you Prof. Gries!
