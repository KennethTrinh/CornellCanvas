 Today in lecture Professor Gries said that it would be beneficial to have something going on the side which supplements our learning. I'm not really sure where to start in finding things like that.
</p>
<p>
 I've done coding bat to learn Java and Python but many of the problems on that website seem to be more about building familiarity with the language rather than what we're learning in this course.
</p>
<p>
 Similarly, I'm unaware of any projects I could start which use data structures and oop in a meaningful way, (or rather I'm not creative enough to think of any within the difficultly of my present skillset).
</p>
<p>
 Do you, or anyone who happens to be reading this, have any suggestions?

  Start an Eclipse project, to be used play around when you want. Nothing big.

 <p>
  Suppose you don't believe the reason why to make a class abstract.
  <break>
  </break>
  Well, put the following class into that project. No problem, right? well
  <break>
  </break>
  put "abstract" after public on the first line. What happens in Eclipse?
  <break>
  </break>
  Does a read x appear to the left of line 2, and what does it say? Then delete "abstract".
 </p>
 <p>
  This is perhaps simplest way you can make concrete for yourself that the purpose of making a class abstract is that you can't create instances of it --the new-expression for it is illegal. If you DON'T do this, you may forget the reason for making a class abstract. However, once you have done this, you probably will never forget it.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is what I mean by trying Java principles, rules, definitions out in Eclipse. It's not a big deal, but it can help a lot.
 </p>
 <pre>      public class C {
          C var= new C();
      }
</pre>
