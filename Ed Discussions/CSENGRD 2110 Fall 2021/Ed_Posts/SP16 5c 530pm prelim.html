 Is the loop gaurd "k &lt;= n", and is the converse "k &gt; n"? Also, how exactly does the initialization not make the invariant true? And why does k = n not keep the invariant true, given that the invariant includes "m &lt;= k &lt;= n"?

  Too many questions!
 </p>
 <p>
  Yes, the loop guard is as stated. You see it there.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yes, it's converse is as you suggest.
 </p>
 <p>
  Initialization: Setting k to m makes P look like z = product of m..m and ...
  <break>
  </break>
  To make P true, you have to set z to m.
