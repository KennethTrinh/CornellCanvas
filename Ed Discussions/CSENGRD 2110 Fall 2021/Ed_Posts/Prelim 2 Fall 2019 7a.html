 Why do we replace the first if statement with what's shown above? From what I remember we want to make sure that the array has more than two elements, or if(k+1-h &lt; 2) return;

  According to java hyper text, the first if statement would be:
 </p>
 <p>
  if (k + 1 - h &lt; 2)
 </p>
 <p>
  which would be simplified with algebraic manipulation:
 </p>
 <p>
  if (k &lt; h)
 </p>
 <p>
  Although I am unsure why the sign is different but I think it would still be correct since k+1-h&lt;2 is straight from Java Hyper Text, which both say "Sort b[h...k]"

   It would actually be more than 1 element(or greater than or equal to 2 elements). With two elements, consider the case where you have the partition as [6, 4]. That still needs to be sorted.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also I think what you wrote
  </p>
  <p>
   if(k+1-h &lt; 2) return;
  </p>
  <p>
   corresponds with "wanting" greater than or equal to 2 elements, not more than two elements.

    I mean greater than or equal to, sorry. But does the if statement that's given as the solution satisfy that?

     It does, so in that case you are correct, but the answer key is also correct(I believe). Because the answer key says that we won't attempt to sort any partition that's size 1 or lower. The algorithm from JavaHyperText says don't sort any partition size 0 or lower. Both would be correct, I think, since sorting a size 1 partition is just leaving it as is.
