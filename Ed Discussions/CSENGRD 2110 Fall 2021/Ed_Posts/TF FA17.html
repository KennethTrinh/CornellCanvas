 "For both the adjacency-matrix and adjacency-list representations of a graph, the worst-case time complexity to process each neighbor of a node is O(n), where the graph has n nodes and processing takes constant time"
</p>
<p>
 What does "processing takes constant time" mean?

  Usually you have a reason for moving through the graph. Maybe you are searching for a particular node or summing the values in the nodes for example. So, we are assuming that your purpose for traveling through the graph takes constant time.

   Searching and summing take constant time?

    At each node for searching, you just need to check if this node == the node I am search for, that takes constant time.
   </p>
   <p>
    For summing at each node, you just do total = total + currnode.value, that also takes constant time.
   </p>
   <p>
    These are just examples of processing time, obviously you can do lots of other things.
