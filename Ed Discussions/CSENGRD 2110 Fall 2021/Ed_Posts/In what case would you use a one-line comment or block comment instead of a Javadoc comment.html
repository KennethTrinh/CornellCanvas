  It's so nice that Javadoc comments enable the hover-over text in Eclipse. In what case would someone not want that?

  Use javadoc comments to
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1. specify methods (the javadoc comment comes before the method header).

  2. Give the class invariant: the meaning and constraints on all the fields. Precede field with a javadoc comment.

  Javadoc comments can only be used with class "members"  (fields and methods and inner classes) and constructors.  Those declarations should always be documented with Javadoc comments (know your audience: if private, the comments help class maintainers; if public, they are for users).
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  But inside of a method, you will have local variables, loops, if-else blocks, try-catch blocks, etc.  Those are not members, so no entry for them will be generated by the javadoc tool.  Yet if your logic is complicated, or if you have "local invariants" (we'll be talking about loop invariants shortly), it should absolutely be documented for code reviewers and future maintainers.  The other comment types are useful in these instances.  (They use the same syntax as used in C and C++.)
