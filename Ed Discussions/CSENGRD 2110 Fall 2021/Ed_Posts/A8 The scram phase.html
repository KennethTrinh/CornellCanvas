  We introduce the methods that can be used in writing method scram. Then, we give some hints and suggestions.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  ===================
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Method scramâ€™s parameter state, of type ScramState, describes McDiver's environment. Every time McDiver makes a move, this object automatically changes to reflect McDiver's new location.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  This object includes the following methods:
 </paragraph>
 <list style="ordered">
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    Node currentNode(): Return the Node corresponding to McDiver's location.
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    Node exit(): Return the Node corresponding to the exit from the sewer system (the destination).
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    Collection&lt;Node&gt; allNodes(): Return a collection of all traversable nodes in the graph.
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    int stepsToGo(): Return the number of steps that are left for McDiver to get to the exit.
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    void moveTo(Node n): Move McDiver to node n and pick up all coins on that node. Also, reduce the steps remaining by the weight of the edge from McDiver's current location to n.
    <break>
    </break>
    This fails if n is not adjacent to the current location.
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
 </list>

  There is no single way to write method scram that works well on
  <italic>
   all
  </italic>
  sewer systems (maps/graphs).
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Some of you may find better ways than we did and get higher scores ---more coins.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  So, get innovative, try various things, post your best scores on Ed Discussion note #1124 so others can see what you got.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Here are some points to consider.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <bold>
   2.
  </bold>
  When scram is called, following the shortest path to the exit is guaranteed to get McDiver out within the prescribed number of steps.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Therefore, your first order of business is to make that simple solution work: Find the shortest path and traverse it.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Write a method that given a path starting on McDiver's current position, has McDiver traverse that path and end up on exit node. It can be useful in lots of situations.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Remember, when McDiver moves to a new node, coins on the node are picked up automatically. You don't have to be concerned with picking them up.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <bold>
   3. TRY DIFFERENT APPROACHES
  </bold>
  . Write a new method for each new approach you take, and
  <italic>
   always
  </italic>
  have a solution that works to fall back on.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Remember, it is better to have a solution that
  <italic>
   always
  </italic>
  gets out in the prescribed number of steps than one that sometimes fails.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <bold>
   4. TIME LIMIT
  </bold>
  . There is an elapsed time limit of about 10-12 seconds on any map. We need that so that it doesn't take hours to grade your submission. We will run on our faster computers, so if yours is a bit slow and old, perhaps 12-14 seconds will be OK.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <bold>
   5. HELPER METHODS
  </bold>
  . Write as many helper methods as you want. It is in your best interests to
  <italic>
   specify them carefully
  </italic>
  . The staff cannot help you if there are methods without specifications --how can they help when they can't tell what the methods are supposed to do? How do
  <italic>
   you
  </italic>
  remember what they are supposed to do? We have instructed the staff not to answer questions when methods are not properly specified.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <bold>
   6. CHANGE SHORTEST PATH ALGORITHM
  </bold>
  . Right now, the shortest path algorithm gives you a path from the current position to any one of your choosing. But you may want to change it or make a copy and alter the copy. For example, one version could find the shortest path to
  <italic>
   all
  </italic>
  nodes and return the HashMap that gives all the information.
