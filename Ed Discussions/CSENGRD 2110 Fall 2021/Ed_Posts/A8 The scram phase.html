 We introduce the methods that can be used in writing method scram. Then, we give some hints and suggestions.
</p>
<p>
 ===================
</p>
<p>
 Method scramâ€™s parameter state, of type ScramState, describes McDiver's environment. Every time McDiver makes a move, this object automatically changes to reflect McDiver's new location.
</p>
<p>
 This object includes the following methods:
</p>
<list style="ordered">
 <li>
  <p>
   Node currentNode(): Return the Node corresponding to McDiver's location.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Node exit(): Return the Node corresponding to the exit from the sewer system (the destination).
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Collection&lt;Node&gt; allNodes(): Return a collection of all traversable nodes in the graph.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   int stepsToGo(): Return the number of steps that are left for McDiver to get to the exit.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   void moveTo(Node n): Move McDiver to node n and pick up all coins on that node. Also, reduce the steps remaining by the weight of the edge from McDiver's current location to n.
   <break>
   </break>
   This fails if n is not adjacent to the current location.
  </p>
 </li>
</list>

  1.
 </b>
 There is no single way to write method scram that works well on
 <i>
  all
 </i>
 sewer systems (maps/graphs).
</p>
<p>
 Some of you may find better ways than we did and get higher scores ---more coins.
</p>
<p>
 So, get innovative, try various things, post your best scores on Ed Discussion note #1124 so others can see what you got.
</p>
<p>
 Here are some points to consider.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  2.
 </b>
 When scram is called, following the shortest path to the exit is guaranteed to get McDiver out within the prescribed number of steps.
</p>
<p>
 Therefore, your first order of business is to make that simple solution work: Find the shortest path and traverse it.
</p>
<p>
 Write a method that given a path starting on McDiver's current position, has McDiver traverse that path and end up on exit node. It can be useful in lots of situations.
</p>
<p>
 Remember, when McDiver moves to a new node, coins on the node are picked up automatically. You don't have to be concerned with picking them up.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  3. TRY DIFFERENT APPROACHES
 </b>
 . Write a new method for each new approach you take, and
 <i>
  always
 </i>
 have a solution that works to fall back on.
</p>
<p>
 Remember, it is better to have a solution that
 <i>
  always
 </i>
 gets out in the prescribed number of steps than one that sometimes fails.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  4. TIME LIMIT
 </b>
 . There is an elapsed time limit of about 10-12 seconds on any map. We need that so that it doesn't take hours to grade your submission. We will run on our faster computers, so if yours is a bit slow and old, perhaps 12-14 seconds will be OK.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  5. HELPER METHODS
 </b>
 . Write as many helper methods as you want. It is in your best interests to
 <i>
  specify them carefully
 </i>
 . The staff cannot help you if there are methods without specifications --how can they help when they can't tell what the methods are supposed to do? How do
 <i>
  you
 </i>
 remember what they are supposed to do? We have instructed the staff not to answer questions when methods are not properly specified.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  6. CHANGE SHORTEST PATH ALGORITHM
 </b>
 . Right now, the shortest path algorithm gives you a path from the current position to any one of your choosing. But you may want to change it or make a copy and alter the copy. For example, one version could find the shortest path to
 <i>
  all
 </i>
 nodes and return the HashMap that gives all the information.
