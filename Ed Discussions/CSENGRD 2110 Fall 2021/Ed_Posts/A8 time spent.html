 Do we need to put the time we spent on A8 somewhere in the file like other assignments? Thanks in advance!

  HI,
 </p>
 <p>
  There is no need for time spent or your netid or anything.
 </p>
 <p>
  It doesn't make sense to publish average time since some people do the minimum and others play around, trying to get more coins.
