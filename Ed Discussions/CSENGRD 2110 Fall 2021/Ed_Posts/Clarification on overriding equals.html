  Part of the three steps to overriding equals is to cast an object ob down to a class C so that its fields can be accessed. Why is this? Shouldn't the initial conditional where getClass() is called on ob mean that a downcast is not needed?

  I'm referring to this JHT entry: https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/JavaAndDS/files/equals.pdf

  You are forgetting the Compile-Time reference rule! Consider class C below. ob has (static) type Object. Does class Object have a field named x? No. Therefore ob.x is illegal and will not compile.

 <paragraph>
  public class C {
  <break>
  </break>
  int x;
  <break>
  </break>
  public boolean equals( Object ob) {
  <break>
  </break>
  ...
  <break>
  </break>
  ...   ob.x    ...
  <break>
  </break>
  }
  <break>
  </break>
  }
