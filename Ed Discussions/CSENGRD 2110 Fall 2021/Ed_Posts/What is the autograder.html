  On the grading policies it says that we should run our code through the autograder to check if our assignments were in order and etc. Where do we access the autograder? Thank you in advance.

  There is none for A0. Wait for the A2 autograder.

  Starting with assignment A1, CMS will run an "auto-helper" whenever you submit code sufficiently before the due date.  When this happens, you will receive an e-mail a few minutes later telling you if there were any major issues.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I want to avoid the term "autograder" - this service does not grade your assignment or thoroughly check its correctness.  What it
  <italic>
   does
  </italic>
  do is detect major mistakes with the "mechanics" of submission: Is your character encoding correct? (be sure you set the encoding to "UTF-8" if you run Windows) Did you accidentally import any extra packages you're not allowed to use? Did you misspell a method name in both your class and your test? Did you upload a blank file? (all of these things happen multiple times each semester, and they slow down our ability to provide you with feedback).
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Historically, the auto-helper turns off the day the assignment is due - we want everyone to get an early start on assignments, and for any detailed debugging you might be doing the last day, the auto-helper won't help with anyway (you need to write your own tests for that).
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  In summary, to access the auto-helper (starting with A1), just submit a draft of your assignment early on CMS, and you'll get an e-mail with the results.
