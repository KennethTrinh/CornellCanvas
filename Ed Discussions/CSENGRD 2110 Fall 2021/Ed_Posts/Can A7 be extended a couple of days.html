 The past couple of days have been great distractions for my coursework in general and especially as I do not feel safe on campus in general. This is all very new to me and I've never experienced something like this before and it's really been hard to process it. It's been quite hard to pull myself together as a result.

 I believe many of us would benefit from this extension as it would help us regain composure and get on the right track again.
