 small question but on todo 8 I am trying to use checkHit but it has an error saying "the method checkHit(int, int) is undefined for the type gameComponent". I am not sure what else to use besides checkHit

  What class is
  <code>
   checkHit(int, int)
  </code>
  a method of?  The error message indicates that it is
  <i>
   not
  </i>
  a method of class
  <code>
   GameComponent
  </code>
  , even though it is defined in the file "GameComponent.java".  Are there other classes defined in that same file that could house the method?
 </p>
