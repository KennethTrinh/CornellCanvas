  They will not appear there until after the New Year.

 <p>
  We first have to complete deciding on course grades for those who took the final. Then, we have a number who will be taking a makeup some time after Christmas.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, if you accepted your course grade, you know what you grade will be. Others who have taken the final or will take a makeup, will have to wait to know their course grade.
