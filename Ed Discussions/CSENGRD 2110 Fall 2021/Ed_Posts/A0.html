 I just checked out A0 and I guess I am just a bit confused. From what I understand the assignment primarily has to do with enabling assert statements, is there supposed to be a way that we represent this in our code to submit? Wouldn't the primary part of the assignment be in our preferences section  and not code so how can we ensure you know we've properly done the assignment?

  A0 is typically used to quickly and easily identify some Eclipse setup issues and errors. We mostly check that you have completed the code for the assignment and trust that you have enabled assert statements, since you will be using them in future assignments.
