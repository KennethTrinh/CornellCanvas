 When I run the H1N1Test file I get this error, saying that it cannot find the path specified in the Network Class in Java.  However, as shown on the right side of the photo the file is in the path that is specified by network.java.  My laptop is running on Windows PC if that is of any relevance.

  The data folder should not be inside the src folder. It should be inside the project but outside the src folder.
