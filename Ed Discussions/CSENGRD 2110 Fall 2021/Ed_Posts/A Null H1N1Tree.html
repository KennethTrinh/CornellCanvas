  Suppose I write:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  H1N1Tree myTree = null;
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Is there anything stopping the user from calling:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  myTree.size();
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  When I try to handle this, by writing if(this == null) {return 0;}, it says the code in the brackets is unreachable.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  What should I do?

  "this" can never be null.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  It evaluates to a pointer to the object in which it appears.

  How would I check if the object I am calling size() on is null?

  If you execute
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  H1N1Tree myTree = null;
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  then myTree contains null, and any call myTree.size() will cause a null pointer exception.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I don't know what problem you are trying to solve. What is the problem?
