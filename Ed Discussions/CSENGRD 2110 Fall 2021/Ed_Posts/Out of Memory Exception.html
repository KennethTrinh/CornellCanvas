 When I try to test my code, the first four tests pass, but the next four take about a minute to process and eventually throw an out-of-memory exception in the java heap space. I tried using println statements to test whether the while loop was running indefinitely, but found it runs a finite amount of times. I tried following the invariant and specifications for the HashMap as closely as possible and I'm still not sure what could be causing this.

  nvm i got it. I was trying to get the priority value of Node f (shortest distance to Node f) through Heap F instead of the HashMap.
