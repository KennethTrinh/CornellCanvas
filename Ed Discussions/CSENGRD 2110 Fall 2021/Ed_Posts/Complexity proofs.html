 Can we have a different c value in our proofs? Or does it need to be the c in the answer key?

  "this is true due to proof by induction on n"
 </p>
 <p>
  would not constitute a proof.

   Any c that works can be used. It depends on the proof.

   Different proofs use different c's and N's.

    So any c and N works as long as the proof makes sense? It doesn't necessarily need to be the smallest c or N? Also, if we use proof by induction to show, for example, that n + 1&lt;= n^2 - 1 for all n&gt;=2, can we simple say "this is true due to proof by induction on n" or would we have to prove that as well to use it?
