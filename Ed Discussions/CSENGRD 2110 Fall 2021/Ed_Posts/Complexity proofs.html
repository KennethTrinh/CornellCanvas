  Can we have a different c value in our proofs? Or does it need to be the c in the answer key?

  Any c that works can be used. It depends on the proof.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Different proofs use different c's and N's.

  So any c and N works as long as the proof makes sense? It doesn't necessarily need to be the smallest c or N? Also, if we use proof by induction to show, for example, that n + 1&lt;= n^2 - 1 for all n&gt;=2, can we simple say "this is true due to proof by induction on n" or would we have to prove that as well to use it?

  "this is true due to proof by induction on n"

  would not constitute a proof.
