 Hi, I noticed in both of the .equals methods for question 3 of the 5:30 2019 prelim, the parameter ob was cast to either a Restaurant or Fancy Restaurant even though the answer already contained a statement checking whether the classes were the same. Would somebody mind clarifying why this is necessary? I thought since they were the same class, we could check name/numTables just using ob.name/ob.numTables

  I think itâ€™s because in the case that ob belonged to a subclass of FancyRestaurant, numTables could return a different value. This would also be why we used getClass instead of instanceOf since ob would not be equal to the object if its lowest partition was not FancyRestaurant.

  ob has static type Object, so you cannot access the fields in FancyRestaurant because they are hidden by the compile-time reference rule
