 Nothing happens when I select the green launch button as stated in step 5 of the installation process (I was not asked to "Select a directory as workspace"). I have a new Mac so I tried again using Eclipse 2020-1 but this did not help.

  Also, make sure you are using Eclipse 2020-12 and not 2020-1. There was a typo on Canvas that got fixed.

   Try going to the directory you installed Eclipse with Finder and launch it there. I had the same issue and it solved it for me. If you can't find the folder, check the "Installation Folder" shown when using the Eclipse Installer. For me it was "Users/*username*/Eclipse."
