  Today's lecture dealt dealt with COMPLETE binary trees.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  That means that the height of the tree of size n is O(log n).
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Bubble-up starts with a node on the lowest level and proceeds upward. This requires at most log n swaps.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Bubble-down start at the root and bubbles downward, at each top through either the left or right child. This requires at most log n swaps.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  However, to find a value in a heap of size n, you may have to look at every node of the heap for that value, That's O(n) work.
