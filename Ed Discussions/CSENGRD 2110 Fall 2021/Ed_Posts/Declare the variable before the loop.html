 <paragraph>
  In the for-loop reading, it says "Variable k cannot be used after the loop. It you want to reference k after the for-loop, declare k before the loop, as in (2)."
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Is the variable k on the 1st line same as the variable k on the 2nd line?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If I add "return k;" after the end of the block above, will I get a result of 0?

  Which line you put it on doesn't matter. Don't think in terms of lines.

  In this case, k is available after the loop.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  int k; for (k= 0; k &lt; 1-; k= k+1) {...} after the loop
 </paragraph>

  In this case, k is available NOT after the loop.

 <paragraph>
  for (int k= 0; k &lt; 1-; k= k+1) {...} after the loop
