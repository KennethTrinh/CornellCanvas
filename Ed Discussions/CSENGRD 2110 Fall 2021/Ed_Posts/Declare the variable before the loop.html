 In the for-loop reading, it says "Variable k cannot be used after the loop. It you want to reference k after the for-loop, declare k before the loop, as in (2)."
</p>
<p>
 Is the variable k on the 1st line same as the variable k on the 2nd line?
</p>
<p>
 If I add "return k;" after the end of the block above, will I get a result of 0?
</p>

  Which line you put it on doesn't matter. Don't think in terms of lines.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this case, k is available after the loop.
 </p>
 <p>
  int k; for (k= 0; k &lt; 1-; k= k+1) {...} after the loop
 </p>
 <p>
  In this case, k is available NOT after the loop.
 </p>
 <p>
  for (int k= 0; k &lt; 1-; k= k+1) {...} after the loop
