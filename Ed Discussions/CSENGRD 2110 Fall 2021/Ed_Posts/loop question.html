  for (b3), how come in the else{} statement, we don't also decrease t by 1? Won't t skip over what got swapped to it in the while loop?

  Because the unknown element in b[j] is being placed in b[t], so b[t] is still unknown.

  so wouldn't that mean we should add t = t-1? Since if not, t will get skipped over?

  No you don’t want to change t at all. What is now in b[t] was originally in b[j] (which we don’t know anything about). We shouldn’t worry about t in the else case, and it won’t get skipped over. You only worry about t when the element b[t] &lt;= x, then you add 1 to t to shift the line over by one.
