  For one of the questions, it says to "Rely only on methods of class String"
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Just to clarify, does this mean that we are not allowed in any circumstances to use a method from class Integer?  I apologize if this is a dumb question; I am having a lot of trouble figuring out how to convert a string to an int using only the String class.

  On that one question, yes. Is this method expand?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  How long is the String that has to be changed into an int?

  This is method expand.  The substring I want to convert into an int is only 1 character long.  I figured it out how to do it using a Magic Number, but the directions say that we can't use those either.  So still not sure how to do it.

  Does it count as a Magic Number if I use the char form of the Magic Number?  I.e., '0' rather than 48?

  '0' is not a magic number.

  Please visit JavaHyperText, type    magic     into the Filter Field, and read the short pdf file that you see there.
