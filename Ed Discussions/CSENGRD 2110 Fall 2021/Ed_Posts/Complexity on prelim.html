 In a lot of the practice prelims, there are questions on complexity and constant vs linear time. This is not going to be on the prelim according to the study guide right ?

  Right. Believe the study guide.
 </p>
 <p>
  Prelims are scheduled at different times each semester.
 </p>
 <p>
  What's on prelim 1 depends on what has been covered.
