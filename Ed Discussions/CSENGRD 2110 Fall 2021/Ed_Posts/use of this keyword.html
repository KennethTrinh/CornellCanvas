 i had previously been in the habit of using this.&lt;field&gt; whenever referencing fields in a class, but noticed the eclipse auto-corrects to remove it in most situations. some of the practice prelim answer sheets do include the "this" keyword, for example in constructors. is there any reason not to include it? or should i only be using "this" when it is necessary to distinguish between an argument and field?

  Don't put "this." where it is not needed.

  Yes, there is a reason not to include it. It just makes the code look more complicated that it has to be. Omit needless stuff. Keep the code as simple and clear as possible.

  Yes, one case where "this." is needed is when it s necessary to distinguish between a PARAMETER and a field

   e.g., if your constructor has a parameter name that's the same as the class field name, using this is imperative. otherwise, using "this" when unnecessary is not needed.
