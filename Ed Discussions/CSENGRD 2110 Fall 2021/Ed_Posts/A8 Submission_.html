  I've been searching for where to submit A8, but I cannot find where to on CMS. I doesn't show up where I have submitted all other assignments on CMS. Is submission available yet?

  Sorry, it was still hidden. I just fixed it on the CMS so you should be able to submit. Let us know if you have problems.
