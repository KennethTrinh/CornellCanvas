 The solution of prelim 2019 (7:30) says the worst-case complexity of the Binary search on an array of size 2^n is O(n).
</p>
<p>
 I am really confused about that. In the worst case, shouldn't the size of the BST be the same as the size of the array, which equals 2^n?  So why the complexity is not O(2^n)?

  Binary search of an array has nothing to do with a Binary search tree.

  Please look up binary search in JavaHyperText.
