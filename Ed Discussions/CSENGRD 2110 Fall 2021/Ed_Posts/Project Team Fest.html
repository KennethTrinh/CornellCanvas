 If you are a freshman curious about Cornell's Engineering Project Teams (who are often looking for software developers to join their projects), check out Project Team Fest tonight (Tue, Sept 21) from 4-7pm in the Duffield Atrium, MAE lounge (Upson 116), and the Experiential Learning Lab (Upson basement).  See
