  For HashSet, you can think like there's no order between elements inside. So it doesn't make sense to get an element in the middle of a HashSet.

  "This class implements the Set interface, backed by a hash table (actually a HashMap instance). It makes no guarantees as to the iteration order of the set; in particular, it does not guarantee that the order will remain constant over time."
