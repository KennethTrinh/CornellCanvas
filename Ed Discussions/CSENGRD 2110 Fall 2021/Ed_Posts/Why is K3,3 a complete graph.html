 I thought the definition of a complete graph was that every node is connected to every other node. But in the K3,3 graph, the top set of nodes aren't connected to each other, although Java Hypertext calls it a complete bipartite graph. Does this mean that the K3,3 graph is a complete bipartite graph, but not necessarily a complete graph because not all the nodes are connected to each other?

  Your understanding is correct. Bipartite graphs cannot be complete since that would mean they are not 2-colorable. However, they can be complete bipartite which contains all the edges possible that do not violate the coloring.
