 What does it mean for the months to be ordered chronologically? I don't get why March points to June and May but April points to just August

  It is not ordered chronologically in a sense that everything to the right of a month will be later, and everything left to the month will be earlier. In that sense, it is ordered alphabetically, but it is inserted in chronological order. January is inserted first, and then February is inserted, and so on. If you are confused about how insertion is done and why it matters in what order we insert the nodes, read this: https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/JavaAndDS/files/tree4BST.pdf

   Since BST's will order strings alphabetically regardless (from lecture slides), if we want to insert the months chronologically it just means we start inserting them into the BST from Jan to Dec, like how we normally count the months (Jan, Feb, Mar, April...)
