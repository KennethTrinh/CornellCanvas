  Here is the specification:
 </p>
 <p>
  /** = the H1N1Tree that has p in its root. &lt;br&gt;
  <break>
  </break>
  * (null if p is not in this tree). */
  <break>
  </break>
  public H1N1Tree node(Person p) {
  <break>
  </break>
 </p>
 <p>
  Each node of an H1N1Tree has a field person. Find and return the node whose person field is p.
 </p>
 <p>
  Read the top of this class. It explains that a node of class H1N1Tree can be considered just as an object in the tree OR as the root of a subtree. It's the second meaning that was used in the specification.
