 I'm a bit confused as to why in line 165, the expected person of dtC is personC and not personB. Isn't the person method meant to return the root of the tree, which in this case is personB?

  the insert method returns the newly added node that is inserted. therefore the call st.insert(personB, personC) returns the tree that just consists of person C. dtC thus stores the node with person C at its root
