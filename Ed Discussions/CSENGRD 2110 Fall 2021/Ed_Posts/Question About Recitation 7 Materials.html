  Hello, everyone! I was trying to take a look at the materials for Recitation 7 in Canvas, but when I try to enter the page for Recitation 7 from the 3-week Schedule, I get a message that says: "Access Denied; You don't have access to view this resource." Was this intentional? Will the link be open by tomorrow? Or is there another place I can find the information? I just wanted to take a look at the materials before recitation. Thank you!
