 My saved scores are saving in another language? I'm not really sure what's going on. They are saving to the files and appending them correctly, just can't understand the characters.

  That's weird.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the ONLY thing that should be in that file is a bunch of number, one number per line. Are you using print or println?

  In order to help, we have to see your code. Post it in a private note.
