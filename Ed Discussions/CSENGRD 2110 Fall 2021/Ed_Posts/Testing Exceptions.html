  Some of the methods ask us to throw the IllegalArgumentException. Do we assume that these exception throwing cases are excluded in the preconditions or should we test for these exceptions?

  If an exception is explicitly mentioned as part of a method's specification, then it is reasonable and wise to test that it is thrown when required.

  If a method just says "precondition", then no tests should be written that violate that precondition.
