 The purpose of Underrepresented Minorities in Computing (URMC) is to promote diversity within the computing fields and foster an environment that empowers underrepresented minorities with technological aspirations through career development, community building and academic support. We host many events such as corporate workshops, resume reviews, mock interviews, and many more.
