 When I try to write to a read only file, this is what I get for the error dialog box. Is everything good, according to the specs because I know that my messages are a little different.

  Your dialog's title is more verbose than the assignment calls for - we just want the name of the exception there, not the whole file path.  The rest of your dialog looks good at a glance, though (it's okay if the message text is a little different - the Exception may be platform-dependent).
