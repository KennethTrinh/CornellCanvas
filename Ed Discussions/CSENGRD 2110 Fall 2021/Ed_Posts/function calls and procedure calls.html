<pre>Hi.  May I know the difference between function calls and procedure calls? How are they defined? Why println(); is a procedure call?
In lecture 2 we have c1.increment();
Is c1.increment(); a function call or a procedure call?</pre>

  If you search on the homepage of JavaHyperText, you can read its definition of "procedure" and "procedure call," which may help clarify things.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this course, a "procedure" is a method that does not return a value; therefore, procedures can be identified as methods whose return type is
  <code>
   void
  </code>
  .  If a method is to be useful, yet does not return a value, then it must have some kind of side effect.  Often, that side effect is mutating the fields of the object that the procedure was invoked on.
 </p>
 <p>
  <code>
   c1.increment()
  </code>
  is a
  <i>
   procedure
  </i>
  call because method
  <code>
   increment()
  </code>
  in class
  <code>
   Counter
  </code>
  has a
  <code>
   void
  </code>
  return type.  Its side effect is incrementing the field
  <code>
   count
  </code>
  in the object referenced by variable
  <code>
   c1
  </code>
  .

   Type these terms into the JavaHyperText Filter Field:
  </p>
  <p>
   procedure             procedure call
  </p>
  <p>
   function                 function call
  </p>
  <p>
   Get used to using JavaHyperText as your first place to look for something.
