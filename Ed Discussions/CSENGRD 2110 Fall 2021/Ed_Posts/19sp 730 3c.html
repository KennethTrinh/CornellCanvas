 I don't quite understand why p needs to be created and cast to Plane. If ob wasn't already a Plane, wouldn't the method have returned false due to the previous line? Thanks!

  A remark about precise language here:
  <code>
   p
  </code>
  is not cast to anything, and the word "created" could be interpreted as either construction or declaration.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the line in question, a variable
  <code>
   p
  </code>
  is
  <i>
   declared
  </i>
  , with static type
  <code>
   Plane
  </code>
  , and then the (address of the) value referenced in variable
  <code>
   ob
  </code>
  is assigned to
  <code>
   p
  </code>
  .  A downcast is applied to the expression
  <code>
   ob
  </code>
  so that the static types of the right-hand-side and left-hand-side are compatible.  So it is
  <code>
   ob
  </code>
  that is cast to
  <code>
   Plane
  </code>
  .

  Do you remember the Compile-time Reference Rule? Memorize it!
 </p>
 <p>
  Please! It is is important to know the rules and principles and use them in answering questions.
 </p>
 <p>
  The expression ob.serialNum won't compile because of the Compile-time Reference Rule: field serialNum is not declared in class Object. that is why the case down to Plane is necessary.
