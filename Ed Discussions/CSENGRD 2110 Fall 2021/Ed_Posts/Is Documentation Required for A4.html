 I was wondering whether documentation was required for A4. I didn't see anything about it in the assignment pdf, but I wanted to make sure.

  I'm not sure what you mean.

  What more documentation would be needed? The handout does say this:
 </p>
 <p>
  "On lines 3..8 (roughly), put your name and netid (both names and net ids if grouped). Also, please tell us what you thought of this assignment in this comment. "
