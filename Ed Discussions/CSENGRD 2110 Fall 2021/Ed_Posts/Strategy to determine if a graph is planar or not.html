 Is there an easy strategy to determine if a complicated graph like the one above is planar besides guessing and checking in your head or drawing a diagram?

  Look for subgraphs that are one of the graphs we talked about that are not planar such as K5. That's probably the best strategy to check if the graph is planar.
