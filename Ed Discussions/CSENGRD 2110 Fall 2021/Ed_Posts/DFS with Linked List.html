 This question asks us to implement DFS using LinkedLists. Would the results have been the sam if I had written stack.addFirst() instead of stack.addLast(), and stack.removeFirst() instead of stack.removeLast()?

  Yes, because you are still using the logic of the stack, which is LIFO(last in first out).
