  For whatever reason, toStringR is not producing the right string when testing insertAfter. The unusual case is that it occurs when the Node n input for insertAfter is the end of the list. checking toString and size works just fine.

  We can't help with what you said. Without seeing the method, how can we tell what is wrong with it? If you make your note private --available only to staff-- you can show code.

  Am I allowed to show the method? In 1110 we were not allowed to.
