 For paintComponent, is it supposed to cover the entire board? For example, when I write g.setColor(Color.BLACK), should I make it so it makes the entire window black?

  It should fill the entire component area with black. Under "Step 5" in the writeup (on page 6), there should be a screenshot of what the screen looks like when the entire component area is filled.
