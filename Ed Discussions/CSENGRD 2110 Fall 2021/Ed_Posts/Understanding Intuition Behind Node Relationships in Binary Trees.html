 Hello,
</p>
<p>
 I understand the parent of a node k is node (k-1)/2, the left child of a node k is 2k+1, and the right child of a node k is 2k+2 â€” is there any resource to show how this is derived or proved? I'm interested in learning the intuition behind why these relationships hold. Thank you!
</p>

  This is a complete tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  One level 0, there is one node, numbered 0.
  <break>
  </break>
  On level 1, there are two nodes, numbered 0, 1.
  <break>
  </break>
  On level 2, there are four nodes, numbered 0, 1, 2, 3
 </p>
 <p>
  Keep going like this. Then look for a relation between a node and its parents,
  <break>
  </break>
  a node and its children. That's all.
