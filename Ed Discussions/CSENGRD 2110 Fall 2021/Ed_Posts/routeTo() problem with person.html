 For routeTo(), when I try comparing person with c in the base case, it makes person equal to the wrong thing. I tested it with a println statement and you can see in the model that it's setting person to EDA, even though the parent of the tree was JOE. I'm really confused by this since I used person.equals(c) in other methods and it worked fine.

  Do not use the simulation and its output to test your method. That tree is right only if ALL methods you write are correct. Instead, use the JUNit testing class to do ALL your testing.
