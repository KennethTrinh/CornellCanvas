 Maybe I'm overthinking about this, but are we trying to compare that this elephant and e are the same objects with the same handles (such that this elephant and e point to the same object?
</p>
<p>
 OR
</p>
<p>
 Are we trying to check whether this elephant and e have the same parents? If we are trying to compare parents, then is this elephant and e still considered to be siblings if they only share a mother or only share a father (e.i. half-siblings)?

  A question like this has been already asked: #116.

  Look at that note. It tells you to look in the A1 handout for a definition of "sibling" in the part that talks ab out Group D.
