  For method insert, I'm confused on how we are supposed to make a new node and add it to the tree. Other than adding c to p's children and adding p as c's person, I really can't seem to figure out how I should make a new node and add it to the tree, please help.

  Are we supposed to make a call on one of the constructors?

  What is used to make a new node? A new-expression.

  Please read line 16, important notes, which talks about two ways that we view an object of class H1N1Tree. Note that c itself does not get added to p's children; children has type Set&lt;H1N1Tree&gt;.
