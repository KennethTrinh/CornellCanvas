 I'm working on TODO 15 and when I tried importing javax.swing.JOptionPane, I'm getting a cannot resolve error. Java is suggesting to create a new class but I don't think that's supposed to happen. How do I fix this so that I can create a JOptionPane in TODO 15?

  I am getting this exact same error and have tried completely resetting the project and even using a different IDE and it still says "javax.swing.JOptionPane cannot be resolved". How did you end up fixing this error?

  <code>
   import javax.swing.JOptionPane
  </code>
  should work, especially if all of your other Swing imports have been fine.  I recommend double-checking for typos (case-sensitive,
  <code>
   javax
  </code>
  , not
  <code>
   java
  </code>
  , etc.).  If you are sure the spelling is correct, you may need to attend office hours so a member of the course staff can take a closer look.
