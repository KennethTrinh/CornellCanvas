 This is a screenshot from the BoundedBuffer pdf from JHT. I'm confused as to what int h represents. To my understanding, n is the number of elements in the buffer, but would h just represent the index of the last element that was inserted in the buffer?

   Does this also mean the element that's first in line to be booted out of the buffer when we call take()?

    exactly, since this is a queue.

    Look at the comment:The n elements in the queue are in b[h], b[(h+1)%length] , ...
   </p>
   <p>
    Doesn't that say that the first element of the queue is in b[h]?

     I see, I was just a little confused by the condition 0 &lt;= h &lt; b.length.
    </p>
    <p>
     If I understand this correctly, this means that the first element can "change" as things are pulled from the bounded buffer?
