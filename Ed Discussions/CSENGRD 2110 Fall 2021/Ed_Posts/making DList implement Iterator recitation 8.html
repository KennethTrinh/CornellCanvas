  when I make the DList class implement Iterator&lt;E&gt;, I get an error that says:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  "The type DList must implement the inherited abstract method Iterator.next()"
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  even though the inner class DListIterator already overrides both next() and hasnext(). I don't know what I'm doing wrong.
