<p>
 Are the practice prelims from the same semester the same? Would it be worth doing both fall 2019 practice prelims( the one given at 5:30 and 7:30) or do they have the same questions.

  All of the practice prelims are different.
 </p>
 <p>
  The 5:30 and 7:30 prelims on a particular date are different but similar.
