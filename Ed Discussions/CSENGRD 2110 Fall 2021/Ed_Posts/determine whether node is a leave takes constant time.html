  In a tree, a leaf is a node without any children.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  So to see whether or not the node is a leaf, check whether or not it has any children. If it has at least one child, it is not a leaf node. If it has none, then it's a leaf node. This operation takes O(1) time.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  In practice, you can think back to A5, where the children was a HashSet. That would be a simple call to size to see whether or not it's equal to 0.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If it's a binary tree with children of a node implemented as fields(let's say leftChild and rightChild), we can just check to see if they are both equal to null, in which case the node would be a leaf.
