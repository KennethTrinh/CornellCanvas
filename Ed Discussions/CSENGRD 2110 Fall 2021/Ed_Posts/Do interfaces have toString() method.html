  In question 2(g) of the fall 2019 7:30pm exam, it asks if the line
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  String s= i2.toString();
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  will compile. Apparently the Java documentation says that
  <code>
   When an interface has no direct SuperInterface, it will create abstract public method for all those public methods present in the Object class
  </code>
  . Doesn't that mean the toString() method will need to be implemented in I2 since an
  <bold>
   abstract
  </bold>
  method toString() is being created?

  No, it won't have to be implemented because it is already implemented on class Object.
