 In question 2(g) of the fall 2019 7:30pm exam, it asks if the line
</p>
<p>
 String s= i2.toString();
</p>
<p>
 will compile. Apparently the Java documentation says that
 <code>
  When an interface has no direct SuperInterface, it will create abstract public method for all those public methods present in the Object class
 </code>
 . Doesn't that mean the toString() method will need to be implemented in I2 since an
 <b>
  abstract
 </b>
 method toString() is being created?

  No, it won't have to be implemented because it is already implemented on class Object.
