  Why don't we create another array? I dont understand how you can modify b as you poll at the same time.

  We don't create another array because that is not needed.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Suppose the heap is in b[0..i]. The typical way one polls is to
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1.Swap b[0] and b[i]. That puts the largest value in the heap in b[i]
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. i= i-1. That take b[i] out of the heap, and it is in its final position.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  3. Bubble b[0] down in b[0..i]

  I think I am having a difficult time understanding because poll changes the length of the array, but we're also trying to put the max value into b[I].

  Poll does not change the length of the array. It changes the part of the array that is being used for the heap.
