 The Cornell Sustainability Consultants (CSC) is an interdisciplinary student group that works with local organizations and industry experts to define not only what it means to be sustainable, but also how to achieve it. CSC serves as a catalyst for sustainability using strategies that range from providing industry-specific recommendations to fostering collaboration both on campus and within local municipalities.
