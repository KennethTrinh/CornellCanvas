  Example: The line
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  assertThrows(AssertionError, ()-&gt; new Elephant(empty, 'M', 2001));
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  flags me under AssertionError and says that "AssertionError cannot be resolved to a variable". It asked me to install JUnit 5 and I did and I should have the necessary import statements as well.

  Yes, installe JUnit 5. If you have not done so, just use File -&gt; New -&gt; JUnit Test Case, follow instructions, and delete the file that is created.
