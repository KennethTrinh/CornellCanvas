 I know you're all very busy preparing the online final but would it be possible to release more specific medians, like for the (-,+) categories. It would really help in deciding to take the final or not.

  Sorry, but since your tentative grade is based on a calculation that incorporates dropped quizzes and an extrapolated final exam score (and
  <i>
   not
  </i>
  directly on the total score shown in CMS), publishing more detailed median grades would not be particularly useful and would in fact add to the confusion (such confusion has already lead to a number of e-mails).
 </p>
 <p>
  Given the intrinsic uncertainty of the situation (including uncertainty in predicting the future), your own
  <b>
   estimation techniques
  </b>
  would be just as useful as any numbers we could publish, despite how "specific" they might look.  Divide the gap between two letter grades into 3 and you'll get a rough sense for where +/- medians probably lie.  Differences between this estimate and the "true" values will almost certainly be smaller than other effects that make over-analyzing the CMS total not a particularly productive pursuit.

  My recommendation is to think back to Prelim 2 and ask yourself, "how much more comfortable with this material am I now compared to then?"  If you feel much more comfortable (and feel good about hashing and concurrency as well, and haven't forgotten everything from P1), then taking the final could be worthwhile.  If you feel equally or less comfortable, then you might enjoy spending your time doing something else.  I find that willingness to cram is not nearly as good a predictor of success as your
  <b>
   current comfort level
  </b>
  with the material, and the latter doesn't depend on grade boundaries.  Just my advice.
