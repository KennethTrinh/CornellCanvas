 The slides from lecture 15 say that the max # of nodes for a perfect tree are 2^(h+1) + 1 but then later it says t hat the number of nodes for a perfect tree are 2^(h+1) - 1. which one is it?
</p>
<p>
 also, is the worst case time to search a tree O(log n) for binary trees or binary search trees?
</p>
<p>
 thank you in advance!!
</p>

  For a perfect tree, it’s 2^(h+1)-1
 </p>
 <p>
  The worst case for a binary tree is O(n) because it’s basically analogous to a linear search (the node could be anywhere in the tree). For a binary search tree, it is O(log n).

   I am getting so confused, the lecture slides say "Takeaway: BST search is O(n) time" ? Is it actually O(log n)?

    O(log n), where n is the number of nodes, is the best case if your binary search tree is balanced. The worst case is when the binary search tree degenerates to a list, and it’s effectively like searching through a list (hence O(n)).
