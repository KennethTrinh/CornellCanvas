  I am a bit confused about when a downcast will be caught at runtime versus at compile-time. Can you let me know if this is correct? Thank you.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If we have:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  class A
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  class B extends A
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  class C extends B
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Then this is something that would be caught at runtime and throw a class cast exception? Is this not caught at compile time because Object a
  <italic>
   could
  </italic>
  be a B but the Java doesn't know if it is until runtime?:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Object a = new A();
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  B b = (B) a;
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  And this would be caught at compile time since there is no way that something of static type int could be a C?:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  int i = 0;
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  C c = (C) i;
 </paragraph>

  Class Cast Exceptions are run-time errors.
