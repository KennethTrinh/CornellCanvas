 I am a bit confused about when a downcast will be caught at runtime versus at compile-time. Can you let me know if this is correct? Thank you.
</p>
<p>
 If we have:
</p>
<p>
 class A
</p>
<p>
 class B extends A
</p>
<p>
 class C extends B
</p>
<p>
 Then this is something that would be caught at runtime and throw a class cast exception? Is this not caught at compile time because Object a
 <i>
  could
 </i>
 be a B but the Java doesn't know if it is until runtime?:
</p>
<p>
 Object a = new A();
</p>
<p>
 B b = (B) a;
</p>
<p>
 And this would be caught at compile time since there is no way that something of static type int could be a C?:
</p>
<p>
 int i = 0;
</p>
<p>
 C c = (C) i;
</p>

  Class Cast Exceptions are run-time errors.
