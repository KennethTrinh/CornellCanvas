  I found this on JavaHyperText about how to evaluate a new-expression. And I have some questions about it.
 </paragraph>
 <blockquote>
  1. Draw (create) a new object of class C.
  <bold>
   Remember to put its name (e.g. C@48ae) on the tab of the object.
  </bold>
  Put the default values in the fields. If Java creates it, the hexadecimal number 48ae is the memory location where the object is stored.
 </blockquote>
 <blockquote>
  2. Execute the constructor call C(args) —remember, the constructor lives in the new object.
 </blockquote>
 <blockquote>
  3.
  <bold>
   Use as the value of the new-expression the name of the new object
  </bold>
  (e.g. C@48ae).
 </blockquote>
 <paragraph>
  1. I am a little bit confused with the use of "name" here. Does "name" stand for the memory location of the newly-created object? Or is it something we assign to the new object?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. Correct me if I am wrong. Take
  <code>
   x= x+3
  </code>
  as an example.
  <code>
   x+3
  </code>
  is the expression and can be evaluated.
  <code>
   x= x+3
  </code>
  is a statement and can be executed. Another difference is that evaluation yields a value and the execution doesn't?

  Please read step 1. It gives an example:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  C@48ae
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  That's what you should put on the tab of the folder. The "C" is the class name, the @ sign stands for "at", and 48ae is either the address in memory of the object (if the computer is evaluating the new-expression) or a number that YOU chose (if you are evaluating the new-expression.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  You don't "assign" anything to the new object.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  There are several ways we might use this expression.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1. In an assignment like.   v= new C(...). Evaluation of the new-expression could yield the value C@48ae; that value is then stored in v.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. In an expression, like.   (new Fraction(1/3).toDouble()
  <break>
  </break>
  In this case, the new-expression is evaluated to yield something like   Fraction@5. Then, immediately, that object's function toDouble() is called to give that fraction as a value of type double. The object can't be referenced after this!

  I hope this helps.

  Thank you very much! That’s very clear.

  Also did I get it right in the second part about difference between execution and expression?
