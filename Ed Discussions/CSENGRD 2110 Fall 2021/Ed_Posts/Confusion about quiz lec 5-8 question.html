 Hi! I don't understand why class Derived's toString() would print instead of Base's.
</p>
<p>
 Thank you!

  d.foo calls Base's printMe(), which then calls toString().  This toString() will refer to Derived's toString() because variable d is of class Derived.  In order to call Base's toString(), you will need to call super.toString(), but that is never called during execution.
