 Hi, I have a question regarding function p in A2. I've read the java hypertext regarding the importance of a return statement in a procedure, however every time I type "return;" after the print statement in the function and save, eclipse automatically removes the return. Did I set up my formatting of eclipse wrong or is there another way to make sure that the return statement stays in the function. Thank you.

  If that return statement is the last one in the method body, it is not necessary, so it is removed.
