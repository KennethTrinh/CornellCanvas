 I take it that the Heap class only contains a Node and it's priority. I need to put the start node into F, but I'm not sure what to do for it's priority, which is 0. I'm not sure if I can just drop 0 in as the second parameter or if I need to use something else like Item (but the HashMap should only be using Item...).
</p>

 Thanks

  If its priority is 0, then use 0 for the second argument.
 </p>
 <p>
  Did you look at the spec of Heap at the top of Heap.java?
 </p>
 <p>
  /** An instance is a max-heap or a min-heap of distinct values of type T &lt;br&gt;
  <break>
  </break>
  * with priorities of type double. */
 </p>
 <p>
  Did you look at the specification and signature of method insert?
 </p>
 <p>
  /** Insert v with priority p to the heap. &lt;br&gt;
  <break>
  </break>
  * Throw an illegalArgumentException if v is already in the heap. &lt;br&gt;
  <break>
  </break>
  * The expected time is logarithmic and &lt;br&gt;
  <break>
  </break>
  * the worst-case time is linear in the size of the heap. */
  <break>
  </break>
  public void insert(T v, double p) throws IllegalArgumentException
