 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 I am a bit confused on how why this graph violates the shortest path algorithm. Can you not take a direct path from c to b or a and just stop there?  Also how is the first invariant false because isn't the path from a node to itself always zero? Does this example suggest that the shortest path algorithm does not work for cyclic graphs?
</p>
<p>
 Thank you!

  Yes, it works for cyclic graphs, but for Dijkstra's algorithm, all the edge weights must be &gt; 0. Here, the edges weights are less than 0. So there is no "shortest path". Every times this path is traversed (a, b, c, a) the path length decrease by 19 points.
