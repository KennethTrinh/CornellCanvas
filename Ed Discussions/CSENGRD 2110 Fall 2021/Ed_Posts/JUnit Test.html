  Aah, IS the same thing in the other two projects also?
 </p>
 <p>
  It's hard for us to figure out what is wrong without seeing your laptop.

   I see a red x to the left of A1.
   <break>
   </break>
   That means there is a syntax error and something is not compiled.
  </p>
  <p>
   Get rid of all syntax errors and then see whether it works. I would also get rid of the errors in the other two projects. Get rid of all syntax errors.
