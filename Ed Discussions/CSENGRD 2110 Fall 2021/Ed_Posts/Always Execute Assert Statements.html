  At the end of A0, it gives instructions on how to always ensure assert statements are executed. However, a paragraph earlier in the assignment noted that one of the benefits of assert statements is that they can be turned on or off depending the what the code was being run for. Should we have assert statements always executed, or have only "-ea" in the VM arguments?

  For now, fix it so that they are always executed. That is best.
