 I'm a little bit confused. If I change the file to read-only and try to save the score, will it automatically throw an exception or do I need to throw one myself? How can it successfully save the score even in read-only txt files without throwing an error?

  Oh, but it worked if I lock the file. I don't think this is good enough though.

  If you attempt to open a read-only file for writing, Java will throw an exception (you don't need to check for this and throw one yourself - your operating system and Java's standard libraries take care of this for you).  The score cannot be successfully saved to a read-only file, which is why you want to display an error dialog telling the user that their attempt to save failed.

  There are other conditions that will also lead to an exception when trying to write to a file (out of disk space, some kinds of file locking, etc.).  This is why the dialog should show the message from the exception that was thrown - that way, the message will accurately reflect any number of underlying issues, even ones that you didn't anticipate (this is polymorphism at work).

   I had a similar problem to the person above. It does not throw an error when I make the text file read only.
