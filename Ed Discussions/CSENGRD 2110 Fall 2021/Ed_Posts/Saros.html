  I recommend using CodeTogether to share code, it worked really well for me. I tried Saros and it didn't work.

  I apologize for the confusion - Saros was a service that we deployed last year when the class was asynchronous, since many students' partners were not in Ithaca.  I was not aware that it was still being promoted on this semester's Canvas site.

  The best learning experience will be if you and your partner work together, in-person, on a single computer (so only one person can type at a time).  This is most similar to "pair programming/XP" methods in professional software engineering, and it forces your brain to think about what's going on from two different perspectives, which helps material stick better.

  Now, depending on how the COVID-19 situation evolves on campus this semester, we may have a number of students in quarantine, in which case Saros could be useful to help them collaborate with their partners.  We will make an announcement if and when we set up the server this semester.
