  After clicking on save file, my pop up window doesn't show the option of searching for a file name. It only has this:

  What did I do wrong? It works when I save onto a certain file, and appends the score number. But I'm not sure how to show the option to search for a file.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Also, are we just supposed to append the score (if the score was 1) as "1" or "Score: 1" ?

  You are using showOpenDialog when you are not supposed to.

  I changed it to save thank you! Is it supposed to "1" or "score: 1"?

  Regarding how to format the score, we allow some flexibility here.  It needs to be on one line, and it needs to show the score as a number, but if you you want to "embellish" it by adding a prefix string, we don't mind.

  File dialogs look different on Macs than on other platforms (due to the different default Swing look-and-feel on Mac OS), so it may not match the screenshot in the handout, and that is okay.  However, I would have expected the confirm button to say "Save" and not "Open", so I'm wondering if you're showing the appropriate dialog type (perhaps another Mac user can confirm).

  I changed to the correct dialog. But it still doesn't give the option to search for a file.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  This is what I see right now:

  I'm not sure what you expect to see.  You have a place to type in a file name, and you can change directories.  Is there something on the handout that suggests it should provide additional functionality?

  The screenshot made me believe that you should be able to search for a specific file to save in, so I was trying to implement that. Do we not need to be able to this? I apologize for all the questions.

  I think there is an option to search for a file in the picture on the handout because the oeprating system is Linux, so I assume that the save dialogue is going to be different between macOS and Linux?

  You just need to show the default "save" dialog, which should provide the ability to choose a directory and type in a file name.  No search features are required (nor are they present in the save dialog on other platforms).  Sorry if the screenshot in the handout seemed to suggest fancier features - it's really pretty barebones.

  That looks right, but make sure you are checking the value of the method you just implemented before executing the try-catch statement.

  By this do you mean if the value equals the approve option?

  Yes, you need to check that before executing the try-catch statement.

  I think the person is using showOpenDialog because the screenshot has an "open" button when it should be "save."  I had this problem before because I was using the wrong method.
