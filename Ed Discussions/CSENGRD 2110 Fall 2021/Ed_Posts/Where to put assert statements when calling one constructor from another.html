<p>
 This note has to do with calling one constructor from another ---for example, in A1, calling the first constructor from the second constructor. You don't have to read further if you are not calling one constructor from another.
 <break>
 </break>
 <break>
 </break>
 <b>
  Rule
 </b>
 : Within a constructor, a call on another constructor
 <break>
 </break>
 cannot appear in any place except as the first statement.
 <break>
 </break>
 <break>
 </break>
 This means that if you decide to have constructor 2 call constructor 1, the assert
 <break>
 </break>
 statements for Preconditions cannot be at the beginning of constructor 2;
 <break>
 </break>
 they must come after that call of constructor 1, e.g.:
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  public
 </b>
 C {
 <break>
 </break>
 <b>
  this
 </b>
 (...);
 <break>
 </break>
 <b>
  assert
 </b>
 bool-exp;
 <break>
 </break>
 ...
 <break>
 </break>
 }
 <break>
 </break>
 <break>
 </break>
 That is OK.
 <break>
 </break>
 <break>
 </break>
 <b>
  NOTE:
 </b>
 If a call on constructor 1 does some assert-checking of Preconditions,
 <break>
 </break>
 the asserts in constructor 1 do not have to be repeated in the rest of constructor 2.
</p>
