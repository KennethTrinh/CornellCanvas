 Apologies if this is a very rudimentary question, but I'm having trouble understanding why the answer is 4 and not 1.

  Start by explaining why you think it should be "1" and not "4".  Then we can identify and clear up the misunderstanding in your mental model of inheritance.

  I suspect you would benefit to review the "bottom-up rule" in JHT.

   My reasoning for why it should be 1 is that since there is an upcast, this instance of class B now accesses the methods of class A. After reviewing the "bottom-up rule" in JHT, my reasoning for why it should be 4 is that despite the upcast, m() is overriden, and thus the instance still calls m() in the subclass. Is this correct?

    Yes. That is correct. When determining which of several methods with the same name is called, always use the bottom-up / overriding rule.

      A follow up, what would we do if we wanted it to call Aâ€™s method?
