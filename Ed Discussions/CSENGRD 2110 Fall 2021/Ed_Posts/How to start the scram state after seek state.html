  After McDiver finds the ring, the scram state doesn't seem to start automatically. Instead there is an error saying the seek(...) threw an exception. How do I start the scram state?

  That means there is an error in your seek state. Once it is fixed, it should automatically go to scram. I had this issue at first too.
