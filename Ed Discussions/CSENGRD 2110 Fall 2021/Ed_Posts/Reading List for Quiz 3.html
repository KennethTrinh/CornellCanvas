  Hi, guys! Just a quick question about the reading list for Quiz 3. So far on Canvas, the reading list stops at Recitation 4 (loop invariants). Does this mean there are no recommended readings for our recursion classes? To study instead, would you recommend that we work on recursive examples from the lectures? Thank you!

  Okay, thank you! I figured it would be the stuff under "recursion" in JavaHyperText, but I did not know if there was anything else.
