 Would this be a good recursive definition for routeTo()
</p>
<p>
 "Answer = all the persons who's children route to person c"
</p>

  I  don't know what you mean "all the persons who's children route to person "
 </p>
 <p>
  What does "who's children route to person" mean?

   I mean if a person's child routes to person c, the person that we're searching for, then add that person to the list.
