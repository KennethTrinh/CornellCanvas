 This may be more of a terminology question but I was wondering what the difference between a data structure and a collections class is. Am I correct in thinking that a data structure that is not a collections class are those
 <b>
  do not
 </b>
 have their own "class" in java? Like Trees, Heaps, Graphs. Whereas a data structure that is a collections class are those that
 <b>
  do
 </b>
 have their own class in Java; like ArrayList, LinkedList, HashMap, Stack, Queue, HashSet? Is this thinking correct?

  Data structure is a term that has nothing to do only with Java.
 </p>
 <p>
  The BST (binary search Tre) is a data structure. It can be implemented in many different languages.
 </p>
 <p>
  Look at this wikipedia page:
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure">
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  The Collections classes and interfaces, the Collections Framework, is Java's implementation of many data structures.

   I see, so not all data structures are directly implemented by Java, correct? For example there is no "BST" class/interface, so programmers create their own BST class.
