  One thing I've found to practice recursion are to take math concepts and adapt them for Java; for example, given a function return the Fourier Series of said function. Not an ideal answer, but I hope this helps!

  ... but that doesn't mean other students can't answer!  Please share any past projects you've done or ideas you have for the future (perhaps this would work better as a mega-thread).

  Here's one: how many "bits of information" are in each letter of English?  This was a question asked by Claude Shannon in the 50s.  You can estimate it by making a game for your friends.  Pick a paragraph of text, but keep it secret.  Open a JFrame, and ask the user to guess a letter.  When they guess the first letter in the paragraph, reveal that letter, then have them guess the next one, and so on.  Keep track of how many guesses each letter takes.  As they reveal more of the paragraph, they'll probably be able to guess whole words in one try.  With a little math, you can convert the accuracy of their guesses into an "entropy".  This exercise gives you practice with Swing, accumulation, and custom data types (and yes, this is how I spent one of my weekends in college).

  Swing apps are rewarding because you can see the results of your work.  If you're an engineer, try simulating a control system for an inverted pendulum, injecting perturbation torques when the user clicks.

  It can also be fun to find interesting datasets on the Internet and write programs to extract unique information or compute summary statistics.  And then there's games, study aids like flashcards, custom planners, etc.  Maybe this will give you a few ideas; most importantly, have fun while seeking to understand what you build as thoroughly as possible.

  Or perhaps learn about the "Log4Shell" vulnerability that's in the news right now, which affects the popular Java library "Log4J".

  In both cases, the issue is user input being provided to a function whose preconditions are more restrictive than "any possible String".  Unless that precondition is thoroughly enforced (via input validation), a user can submit input that violates it, and when preconditions are violated, "anything can happen."  A research field called "taint checking" leverages a language's type system to force user input to be validated before being passed to other functions (this technique was very recently employed in the Firefox browser to defend against "supply chain vulnerabilities" - bugs in one of the dozens of of third-party libraries they rely upon but can't maintain themselves).
