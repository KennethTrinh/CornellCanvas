  I got this message from the autograder, but I checked my test cases, my assertion statements, my fields, and all of my methods. I covered all the preconditions and multiple cases for each method in my test cases. What does this error mean?

  It shows that you have errors.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1. Read the second page of the handout, where it talks about assert statements and how to test for n.length &gt; 0.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. Look at the precondition of the first constructor (probably the second, too).

  What values can the gender be? And what values do your assert statements test for? (note capitalization or not. You are not being careful).

  3. Why aren't you putting   &lt;br&gt;. in suitable places in Javadoc  comments to mae them readable?

  4. Why are you calling mom() and dad() in methods addMom and addDad? Use the fields directly.
