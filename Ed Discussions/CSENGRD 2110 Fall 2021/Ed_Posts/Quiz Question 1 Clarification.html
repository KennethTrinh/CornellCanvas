   I put these as my answers during the fourth attempt. I am so confused as to which ones I got wrong. I got only 3 out of 5 points, but I thought I put the right answers for all of them.

    key statement: y is not a program variable. it's just what they used in the diagram to indicate the value of b[n-1]. it's not actually defined in the program.

      iirc wrong answers count for negative points. so that was the only wrong answer.

       I think there was no negative points on this one. The other mistake you had was in answer 5. In your answer, you are editing the value of c[h] when you are supposed to just sort the values in array. So, you have to swap c[h] and c[k]. So, in that case, you will store value of c[h] in a temporary variable and then do c[h] = c[k]; c[k] = temp;
      </p>
