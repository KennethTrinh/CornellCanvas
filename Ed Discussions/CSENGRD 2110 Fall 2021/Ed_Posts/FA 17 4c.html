 Why do we do t.val - 1 and t.val +1 and pass those in for k and h respectively?

 I think h and k might've gotten swapped in the explanation here. In the first part where the root is 50 and we say all the nodes to the right have to be &gt;= 51 we use h to denote 51. However, later it says that, for the left subtree, we have to pick h...t.val - 1 or in the case of root = 50 that means all the values to the left have to be somewhere in between 0...41. That's why we say t.val - 1 for the left side to mark the max value we could have that's not the root value?
