  The assignment is due Thursday, Dec 2, and should not take more than an hour to complete if you first read the lecture notes and JavaHyperText entries on concurrency.  If, while working on the assignment next week, you don't feel comfortable with some of the topics, don't hesitate to ask about them at office hours.  In the meantime, enjoy the remainder of your Thanksgiving break.
