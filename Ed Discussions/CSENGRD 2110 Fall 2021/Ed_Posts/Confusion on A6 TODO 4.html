 I'm still confused about what is meant about drawing the target at its current location on top of a default JPanel background. What is meant by deferring to a superclass in order to provide a default. Also, as per drawing the target itself, I see that in the inner class Target there are fields that provide the x and y coordinates of the Target's location but I'm unsure how to actually use those for the purposes of the TODO specification.

  1. This is in paintComponent. Deferring to the superclass means calling the superclass method by that name.
 </p>
 <p>
  2. Look at methods of class Graphics, since g, of class Graphics, will be used to draw items using g. You don't have to be concerned where these are drawn, Graphics G knows that.

   I'm still a little unsure about what providing a default means. Does this refer to the color of the background for an inactive game?

    The superclass,
    <code>
     JPanel
    </code>
    , already knows how to paint itself, and it will do so by drawing an appropriate background that blends in with the rest of the window (adapting to the current "look-and-feel" settings).  You could consider this the "default" look of a component derived from JPanel.  When a game is active, we want to start with that default look, then draw on top of it.
