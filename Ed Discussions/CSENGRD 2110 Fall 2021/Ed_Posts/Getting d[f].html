  To my understanding d[f] exists as f's priority in F and is stored in its Item, but I can't seem to get the priority from F and don't see a get method for Item, so how do I access the value of d[f] when I need it? Or is there something wrong with my understanding?

  Why do you need it?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Where in the abstract algorithm do you have to get it?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If at some point during the development of the abstract algorithm, ask again.

  I thought we need d[f] for d[w]= d[f] + wgt(f, w);

  Yes, you need d[f] for d[w]= d[f] + wgt(f, w), but get that out of the HAshMap, not the frontier set.
