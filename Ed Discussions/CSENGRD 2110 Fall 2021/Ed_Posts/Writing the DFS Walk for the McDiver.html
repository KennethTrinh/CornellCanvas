 In the DFS walk I have to mark a node (i.e tile) as visited. Is the idea to use A7.java within the DFS walk to do this?
</p>
<p>
 the part about "if w is unvisited", how do I know that McDiver has visited the tile? I'm not seeing anything in Tile.java or Node.java to mark the tile. Would I need to do that with A7.java?
</p>
<p>
 A7.java should be modified to match the details of A8?
</p>

  You need to create your own data structure for visited nodes. It has nothing to do, really, with A7.java.
