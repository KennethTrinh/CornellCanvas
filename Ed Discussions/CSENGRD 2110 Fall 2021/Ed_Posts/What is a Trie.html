 I don't understand this one:
 <i>
  "a key-value pair (c, t) represents the edge labeled with c from this trie to trie t"
 </i>
 .
</p>
<p>
 An edge is labeled with c. Got it.
</p>
<p>
 What's the part about "c from this trie to trie t" saying? I see a child is instantiated as a Trie.
 <break>
 </break>
 So adding a child is connecting a trie to another trie?
 <break>
 </break>
 <break>
 </break>
 Is each child a trie? I thought a trie was a collection of nodes (i.e children)

  It's like a tree, except each highlighted node (going downward) spells out a word in the English language

   I see that much, but I don't get what's being defined as a child or why a child is defined as a Trie

    A child has the same definition as for a normal tree, but in this case, the children of nodes also form their own tries, where they are the heads
