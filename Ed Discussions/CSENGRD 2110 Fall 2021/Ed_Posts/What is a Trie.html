 <paragraph>
  I don't understand this one:
  <italic>
   "a key-value pair (c, t) represents the edge labeled with c from this trie to trie t"
  </italic>
  .
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  An edge is labeled with c. Got it.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  What's the part about "c from this trie to trie t" saying? I see a child is instantiated as a Trie.
  <break>
  </break>
  So adding a child is connecting a trie to another trie?
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  Is each child a trie? I thought a trie was a collection of nodes (i.e children)

  It's like a tree, except each highlighted node (going downward) spells out a word in the English language

  I see that much, but I don't get what's being defined as a child or why a child is defined as a Trie

  A child has the same definition as for a normal tree, but in this case, the children of nodes also form their own tries, where they are the heads
