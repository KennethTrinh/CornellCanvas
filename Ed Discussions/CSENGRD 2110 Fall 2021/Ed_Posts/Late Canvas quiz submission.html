 The due time of the Canvas quiz was Sunday 11 pm, but it was available until 11:59 pm. I submitted the quiz late, i.e. later than 11 pm but before 11:59 pm. Is my submission valid?

  Please always submit by the "due date" published on Canvas or CMS as appropriate.  While submissions may be allowed for a short time after that deadline, a late penalty may be assessed.

   Thank you! btw, the lowest Canvas quiz score will be dropped out, correct? That is, only 4 quizzes will be counted toward the final score?

    Yes, as described on the "Notes on grades" page on Canvas, the lowest quiz score will be dropped.
