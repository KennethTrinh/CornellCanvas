  Hi! I am. I am quite confused that couldnâ€™t the race condition problem happened in hashset also happened in arraylist? Is there any difference between the race conditions problems that could possibly occur for these 2 data structures? Or could we just switch the answer in this question? If so, why is it?

  Thanks!

  Please read both questions again carefully. One is about HashSet, the other is about ArrayList, and both have the same answer.
