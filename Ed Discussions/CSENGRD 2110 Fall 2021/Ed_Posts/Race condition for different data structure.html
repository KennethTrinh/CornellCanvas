 Hi! I am. I am quite confused that couldnâ€™t the race condition problem happened in hashset also happened in arraylist? Is there any difference between the race conditions problems that could possibly occur for these 2 data structures? Or could we just switch the answer in this question? If so, why is it?
</p>
<p>
 Thanks!

  Please read both questions again carefully. One is about HashSet, the other is about ArrayList, and both have the same answer.
