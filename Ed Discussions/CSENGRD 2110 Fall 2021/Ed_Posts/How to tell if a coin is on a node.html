 On A8, for the scram phase, I don't know how to tell if a node has a coin. I can see it on the gui, but there's no field about coins in node.java that I can see. I want to prioritize which nodes/tiles to reach.

 <p>
  use method getTile() on a node to access the variables of the tile of the node.
