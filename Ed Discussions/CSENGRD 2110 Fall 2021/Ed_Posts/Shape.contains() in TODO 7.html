  For the checkHit method:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Are we allowed to create an ellipse2D with the dimensions of our target and use the .contains() method to check if our mouse coordinates are inside the shape?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I found that this allowed me to get a more precise hitbox because the constructor for ellipse2D takes doubles.

  (My coordinates for the upper left point of the circle ended up being a double because I had to calculate the upper left coordinates from the fields X, Y which define the center)

  The precision is not necessary here (center coordinates, mouse positions, and radius are all integers, and we're being a bit sloppy about pixels centers vs. edges anyway), so I recommend doing the math yourself to determine whether the click is a hit.
