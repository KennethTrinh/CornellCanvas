<p>
 the assertThrows statements are okay for methods but I'm not sure how to write one for the preconditions of the constructor parameters. In order for me to write an assertThrows, I have to create a constructor the conflicts with the parameters but I get an assertion error before my assertThrow statements can run.

  1. Put the new-expression in the body of the anonymous function.

  If you have too much trouble, leave this be and do other things. A1 is due this evening.
