 For some reason, the assertequals that was already written in the test for testing routeto gets scrambled in the failure trace.
</p>
<p>
 For example,
</p>
<p>
 <i>
  assertEquals
 </i>
 ("[A,B]", getNames(route1));
</p>
<p>
 results in
</p>
<p>
 org.junit.ComparisonFailure: expected:&lt;[A,[]B]&gt; but was:&lt;[A,[ ]B]&gt;
</p>
<p>
 If I change it to
</p>
<p>
 <i>
  assertEquals
 </i>
 ("[A,B,C]", getNames(route1));
</p>
<p>
 it becomes
</p>
<p>
 org.junit.ComparisonFailure: expected:&lt;[A,[B,C]]&gt; but was:&lt;[A,[ B]]&gt;
</p>
<p>
 What is going on?

  Get names returns with spaces included in between the elements. for an array with elements A then B then C for example it returns a string [A, B, C].
 </p>
 <p>
  Kind of annoying but you should have looked at the spec and/or the code because its kind of obvious. Also thinking of tostring representations they usually include the spaces actually, I think most array toString use the spaces.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lowkey I did make the same mistake as you at first so I get the issue.
 </p>
 <p>
  You can see from the expected vs. actual there are extra spaces in the actual and none in the expected when you run the assert equals.

   Look at the specification of method getNames!
  </p>
  <p>
   Please begin uses specifications to solve you problems.
  </p>
  <p>
   That specification tells you exactly the format of its output.
