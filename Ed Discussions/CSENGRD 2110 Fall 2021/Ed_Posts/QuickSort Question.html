 <paragraph>
  According to the invariant, b[h..t-1] contains values &lt;= x, not b[h+1..t].
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  As long as b[t..j] contains a value, i.e. as long as t &lt;= j, at least one more iteration is necessary.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The loop ends when t = j+1. In that case, b[t..j] is empty, and b[j] is the element before the section of &gt;=x values, which means that b[j] is the last element of the &lt;=x values.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Compare carefully invariant P and postcondition R. When do they look the same? When the  ? section is empty.
