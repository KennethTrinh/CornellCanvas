 When talking about the number of edges in a spanning tree I know it's n-1, where n is the number of nodes.
</p>
<p>
 Why wouldn't  |E | = |V| - 1 not also state the same thing?

  It depends on how the question is stated.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the question says, "Consider a graph with e edges and n nodes ..."
 </p>
 <p>
  then regurgitating something one memorized, like |E| = |V| -1, doesn't make sense.
 </p>
 <p>
  One should be able to read a question and answer it.

   That does state the same thing.
