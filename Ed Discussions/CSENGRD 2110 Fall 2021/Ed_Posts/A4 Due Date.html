  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I was wondering if A4 is due Thursday, Sept. 30th (says on Canvas) or Wednesday, September 29th (says on CMS)?

  They both (Canvas and CMS) say 30 September.

  A4 auto-helper says 29 September.

  The "A4-linked lists" assignment was hidden in CMS.  It should now be visible, with its Sept 30 due date.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The AutoHelper will not be available on that last day; final submissions must be uploaded to the "A4-linked lists" version of the assignment.
