 Hello,
</p>
<p>
 I was wondering how much of our final grades A0, A1, and A2 count for. I see on the course website assignments range in range “1…6” but it doesn’t state the number for them individually. Could anyone let me know?
</p>
<p>
 Thanks in advance.
</p>

  The weights appear of graded material appears on the CMS. Take a look.
