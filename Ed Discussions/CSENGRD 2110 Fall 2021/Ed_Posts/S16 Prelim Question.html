  The answer key says this is false. Am I understanding this correctly if I reason that it is false because pet is static type Animal are compile-time, while spike is of static type Dog, which therefore is why this statement is illegal?

  It doesn't compile because it requires casting an Animal object down to a Cat, and only upward casts are inserted automatically. Write:

 <paragraph>
  Dog spike= (Dog) pet;
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  That will compiler=.
