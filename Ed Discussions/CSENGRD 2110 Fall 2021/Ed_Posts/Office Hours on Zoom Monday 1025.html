 Hi everyone,
</p>
<p>
 I am supposed to have office hours from 2:30 - 4:30 pm tomorrow, but I have a big event from 10am - 3pm then, so I'll have to start OH late. I think Zoom is an easier alternative to going to Rhodes 400 (that way I can still do 2 hours because I think CS 2800 has the room after 4:30).
</p>
<p>
 Thus, I will have zoom office hours tomorrow starting at around 3:15pm (in case the event goes long) and will go until 5:15pm. My zoom link is

 </a>
 . See you then!
</p>
<p>
 Best,
</p>
<p>
 Dhruv
