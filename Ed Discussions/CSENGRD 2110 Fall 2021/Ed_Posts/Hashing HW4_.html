 Between questions 6-7 and questions 8-10, are we assuming the array resets? As in, do we assume that the values we calculated for questions 6-7 do not carry over into questions 8-10?

  View each of the questions 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 as independent from the others.
 </p>
 <p>
  For each, start with an an empty hash set and Add the values 1, 66, 31, and 15, in that order.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
