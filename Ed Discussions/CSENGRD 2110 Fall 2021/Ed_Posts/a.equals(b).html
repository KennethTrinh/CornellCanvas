 Hi! I am little bit confused about two properties of equality, as when will the equality be not reflective and transitive? What does it mean by a.equals(a) == false? Is there any examples that we could look at?
</p>
<p>
 Thanks!

  An equivalence relation
  <i>
   must
  </i>
  always be symmetric, reflexive, and transitive.  Any implementation of
  <code>
   equals()
  </code>
  that does not have these properties is buggy.  Examples of such bugs were included on the recent Canvas quiz (you should be able to review your responses).
 </p>
 <p>
  If you follow our template for implementing
  <code>
   equals()
  </code>
  and compare all fields using either
  <code>
   equals()
  </code>
  or
  <code>
   ==
  </code>
  as appropriate, then your implementation will most likely satisfy all three of these properties automatically.

   Hello,
  </p>
  <p>
   Here is a PDF file from java hyper text on the function equals:
   <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/JavaAndDS/files/equals.pdf">
    https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/JavaAndDS/files/equals.pdf
   </a>
  </p>
  <p>
   Some examples can be found here:
   <link href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/JavaAndDS/files/equals.zip"/>

  </p>
  <p>
   a.equals(a) == false means that object a is not equal to itself.
