  Do we have a formula to estimate our A8 grade based on the average score I get by running headless mode?

  No. We don't have one. Sorry.

  The best is to compare with what others have done in the note #1124.

  Can you edit #1124? It may be that only instructors can edit it.

  if you can't, will you start another Note (not a question) with title "A8 Scores"?
  <break>

  I will then populate it with a few things to get people started on putting their scores in there in a friendly competition.

  Probably using a shared Google Sheet would be best for this, as we can all easily type our values into it.
