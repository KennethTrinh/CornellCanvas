  per #417, i would like to check the value of the Node returned by getNode() in my test cases. since Node is an inner class of DList, is it legal to use &lt;Node&gt;.value() in my assertEquals  statement?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  it seems like the methods within the Node class dont have public/private annotations so i'm a little unclear on whether they can be used at all outside of DList.
