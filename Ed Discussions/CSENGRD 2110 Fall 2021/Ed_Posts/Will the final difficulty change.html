  As for finals that is now going to be taught online, will the difficulty be changed (as to account for students that may have easy access to notes or such)?

  I was originally scheduled to take the final online. They have a pretty thorough system of remote proctoring. Not saying those who want won't be able to find a way but it's pretty good.

  At least when I took the CS 1110 final (as well as all the other prelims) online last semester, the remote proctoring was strict.  You needed to have two devices on zoom.  You also needed to prove that all the paper you were gonna use is blank.

  Yeah. I mean, people get creative, but I felt pretty secure that the test would be fair.
