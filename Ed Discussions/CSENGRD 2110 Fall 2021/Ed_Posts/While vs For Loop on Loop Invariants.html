  Would we still get full points on this problem if we had used a for loop instead? Something like:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  int e = k+1;
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  int f = k;
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  for (int i=e-1; i&gt;=h; i--){
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  if (b[i] &gt;= 0) {
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  .      swap(b, i, f);
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  f--;
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  .   }
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  }
 </paragraph>

  I'm not going to check the details, but yes, we use loop invariants for both for-loops and while loops.

  Since this question was given in terms of a while loop, I don't know why you want to change it, making it harder for yourself. On tests, give the simplest, shortest correct answer. Save yourself time and effort
