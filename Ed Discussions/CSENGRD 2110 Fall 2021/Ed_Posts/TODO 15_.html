 Hello, outside of the try except in todo 15, I initialized a PrintStream variable and used it inside the try statement. But since it's inside the try, eclipse is giving me the 'error' that the local variable is not used. Can we leave this in, or is this wrong? We are unable to remove the variable as the try statement uses it. Thank you!

  Why are you initializing a PrintStream variable outside the try-statement?Where in the handout or TODO 15 comments do you see anything telling you to do that?

  Before the try statement, you just need to use a Dialog thing to get the file to write to.
