 Since b and d are both the same depth (3) from vertex a, why does d come before b in bfs?

   It all depends on the order in which nodes are put into the queue. Does the question state somewhere to use alphabetical order if there is more than one neighbor? I can't see the question.

   Did you execute the BFS yourself to see what the result would be? What was your answer?

    Thanks for the quick reply! I think I missed the edge from f to d the first time around. After executing BFS again, I got the correct answer.
