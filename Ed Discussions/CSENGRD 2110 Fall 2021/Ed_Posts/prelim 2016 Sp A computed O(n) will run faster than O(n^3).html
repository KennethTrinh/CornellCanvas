  Hi! I am wondering about the T&amp;F questions on prelim 2016 Sp A
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  computed O(n) will always run faster than O(n^3). Why is it false?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thanks!

  It depends on what the value of n is.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For instance A = 35 and B = 2.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  O(A) is 35.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  O(B^3) is 2^3 = 8.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  O(B^3) will run faster than O(A) despite being raised to the third power.

  Here is another example.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  n = 1.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  O(n) = 1.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  O(n^3) = 1.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  They both run at the same time.  I think this is a better example than what I posted as it is more simpler.
