  I've submitted my Elephant.java and ElephantTest.java to CMS, and I received a message from the AutoHelper stating that while my ElephantTest passed all 4 tests, my Elephant.java did not compile.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I've checked through the A1 # Autohelper post but it doesn't seem like any of those are the problem. Are there any other possible issues I could look out for? Thank you!

  You didn't test your assert statements very well, and your mistake causes our grading program to fail when constructing a particular Elephant.
 </paragraph>

  I suggest that you put a test of the second constructor into the JUnit class Elephant.Test. You will find that it always fails because of how your assert statements are written. I don't want to tell you exactly what the error is; you need practice finding errors.
