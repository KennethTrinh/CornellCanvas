  We got the feedback from the autohelper says:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Failure in testBooleanFunctions(): java.lang.AssertionError: expected:&lt;false&gt; but was:&lt;true&gt;
  <break>
  </break>
  Failure in testassert(): org.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: Unexpected exception type thrown ==&gt; expected: &lt;java.lang.AssertionError&gt; but was: &lt;java.lang.NullPointerException&gt;
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For our test file. what does those feedback mean? Are we having some mistakes in the code or we don't have enough test cases? Thanks in advance!

  The first: It looks like one of the following holds:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1. You don't have an assert statement for a Precondition
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. You have an assert statement even though the method spec has no precondition.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  3. An assert statement is incorrect.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  that's all I can say ...
