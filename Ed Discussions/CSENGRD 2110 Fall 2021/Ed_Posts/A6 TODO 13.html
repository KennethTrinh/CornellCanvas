  When we add labels to Slider, the right slider's minimum label is always incomplete. The "w" for "slow" cannot display completely.

  The weird thing is that it can show normal and complete if we use my partner's laptop.

  Don't worry about this - dealing with fonts is hard, especially on modern high-DPI displays (i.e., when you set a "magnification" for your monitor).  Swing predates OS support for such displays, as well as many font features now used by modern OSs, so occasionally it has glitches.  There are ways to add "padding" to components as they're laid out to make them more robust, but that's well beyond what we're focusing on here.
