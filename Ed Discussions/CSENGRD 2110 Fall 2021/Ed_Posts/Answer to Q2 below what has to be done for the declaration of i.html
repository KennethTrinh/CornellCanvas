  Given that space of i is allocated before execution (not sure how to describe exactly when) and local variable will not be automatically initialized, I am confused about the answer.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Is it "store a pointer to the space allocated in local variable i"? Which I still feel wrong since this should also be done before execution...

  1. Do you remember the steps in executing a method call? The first is to push a frame for the call onto the call stack. It contains space for all local variables and parameters. THAT is when space is allocated.

  Therefore, during execution of the method body, NOTHING has to be done for the declaration of i.
