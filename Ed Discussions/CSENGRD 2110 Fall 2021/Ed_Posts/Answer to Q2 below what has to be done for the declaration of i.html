 Given that space of i is allocated before execution (not sure how to describe exactly when) and local variable will not be automatically initialized, I am confused about the answer.
</p>
<p>
 Is it "store a pointer to the space allocated in local variable i"? Which I still feel wrong since this should also be done before execution...

  1. Do you remember the steps in executing a method call? The first is to push a frame for the call onto the call stack. It contains space for all local variables and parameters. THAT is when space is allocated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Therefore, during execution of the method body, NOTHING has to be done for the declaration of i.
