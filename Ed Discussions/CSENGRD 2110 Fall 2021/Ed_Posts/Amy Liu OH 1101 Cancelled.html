  Hello, I woke up feeling a bit sick this morning, so I'm cancelling my office hours today.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I will try to hold office hours tomorrow over zoom since the assignment is due soon, but I'm not quite sure of my availability yet. I will post again tomorrow if I can hold them.
