  Isn't var an object of class C? If so, I thought casting it to D wouldn't be allowed since that would be a downcast.

  In order for this to work, the D object must be cast to C.

 <paragraph>
  This cast will be inserted automatically because it is an upcast. It's as if it was written like this:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  C var= (C) (new D(...));
