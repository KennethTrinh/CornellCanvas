  In a practice prelim:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  In a tree, every path between two nodes s and t in which all nodes are different is a shortest path from s to t.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Answer: True. There is a unique (simple) path between two nodes in a tree.

  Shortest path in this case is not referring to the shortest path possible from s to t, right? If not, is "a shortest path" just referring to a path with all different nodes? and if so why is it referred to as a shortest path? is it that it's the shortest path of all paths that are sub paths of it? (I don't know if that is a thing but I mean where a path has some sort of cycle in it)
