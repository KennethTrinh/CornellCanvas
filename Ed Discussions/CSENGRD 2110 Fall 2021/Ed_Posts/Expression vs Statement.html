 Is it true that the main difference between a procedure call and function call is that the function call returns a value, but the procedure call does not?
</p>
<p>
 I haven't really thought about this question until today. Open to any correction or additional clarification.
</p>
<p>
 Thanks

  Yes, that is correct.
 </p>
 <p>
  Consider function max(x, y), which returns an int depending on whether int x is bigger than int y or not. You can use a call max(x, y) in a statement, such as
 </p>
 <p>
  z= max(x, y) + 2;
 </p>
 <p>
  Consider a procedure p(x, y), which DOES something but doesn't return a value. Therefore, the statement
 </p>
 <p>
  z= p(x, y);
 </p>
 <p>
  is syntactically wrong. It won't compile. Because procedure p does not return a result.
 </p>
 <p>
  A procedure call is a statement, not an expression, so it would be written as
 </p>
 <p>
  p(x,y);
 </p>
