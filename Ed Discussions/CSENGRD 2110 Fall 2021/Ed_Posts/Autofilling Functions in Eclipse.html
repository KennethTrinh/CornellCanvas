  I'm working on A6 on a Mac and my lab partner is using a windows laptop. We are coding at the same time on separate laptops. When he tries to call a method of an object, it shows a comprehensive list of methods he can call. On my computer, it doesn't seem to show as comprehensive of a list. I believe I did all the eclipse preferences from the beginning of the class, is there anything else that I might be missing in order to get these method suggestions to show up in eclipse? For reference, I have attached a picture of when he types in e. and when I type in e.

  maybe try importing the preferences again just in case?  Also double check e is a mouse event.

  I tried some other classes and they seem to give more detail, so it may just be a mouse event problem, which I can't figure out why it would be the case

  For Eclipse to provide such documentation, it needs access either to the source code of the classes or to the generated JavaDoc.  These are sometimes, but not always, provided alongside your JDK installation.  Do you see a pattern for when you do or don't see documentation?  Do you always see it for classes that are part of a demo or assignment, but never for classes in the Java standard library?  If so, then you probably need to install the Java sources or documentation.

  I admit I'm not an Eclipse expert (and it's been more than a decade since I was actively trying out different JDKs on my machines), but this might be a direction to search in.  I suspect the issue has more to do with the availability of parts of the JDK and less to do with Eclipse's preferences.
