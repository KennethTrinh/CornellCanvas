 I am not sure if synchronizedSet was covered in lecture and I can't seem to find any thing on Java Hyper Text about it.  Thanks!

  It is worth knowing that the collections classes in
  <code>
   java.util
  </code>
  are thread-unsafe and should not be shared "raw" with multiple threads.  To make them thread-safe, additional synchronization must be implemented (ideally encapsulating the thread-unsafe class behind thread-safe methods).  The "synchronized" wrapper collections are one way of doing this.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, this question is not very specific about what it considers to be "threadsafe".  By synchronizing the collection's methods, race conditions cannot violate the collection's class invariants (so the
  <i>
   class
  </i>
  is thread-safe).  But it is still possible to write higher-level operations that are subject to race conditions.  The important point is that using thread-safe classes and synchronizing individual method calls is not sufficient to protect your program from race conditions; thread-safety isn't "composable".  Typically, synchronization must be done at the level of a "transaction".
