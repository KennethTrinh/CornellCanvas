  I am not sure if synchronizedSet was covered in lecture and I can't seem to find any thing on Java Hyper Text about it.  Thanks!

  It is worth knowing that the collections classes in
  <code>
   java.util
  </code>
  are thread-unsafe and should not be shared "raw" with multiple threads.  To make them thread-safe, additional synchronization must be implemented (ideally encapsulating the thread-unsafe class behind thread-safe methods).  The "synchronized" wrapper collections are one way of doing this.

  However, this question is not very specific about what it considers to be "threadsafe".  By synchronizing the collection's methods, race conditions cannot violate the collection's class invariants (so the
  <italic>
   class
  </italic>
  is thread-safe).  But it is still possible to write higher-level operations that are subject to race conditions.  The important point is that using thread-safe classes and synchronizing individual method calls is not sufficient to protect your program from race conditions; thread-safety isn't "composable".  Typically, synchronization must be done at the level of a "transaction".
