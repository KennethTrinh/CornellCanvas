  I was a little unsure why bubble up and bubble down have time complexity O(log(n)). I assume it has something to do with the "binary-characteristic" of heaps, but I can't find a clear explanation of why exactly it is log(n)

  O(logn) is the height of the heap.

  Here, log(9) = 3.

 <paragraph>
  3 is the height of this tree.

  If we want to bubble up an element beginning at the bottom of the tree, it will take 3 switches to get to the top.

  O(logn) is the height of the heap because the heap-tree is complete; it has all nodes on all levels except the bottom one and all nodes on the bottom level are al the way to the left.
