 How should one come up with the run times for all the sorting algorithms rather than memorizing the table? Is there some sort of intuition for this?
</p>
<p>
 Also in general, I noticed on the prelims we have to determine the worst time scenarios, is there some sort of intuition to this too?

  Understanding the various sorting algorithms can help you memorize the time complexities.
 </p>
 <p>
  Let's look at merge-sort. for example:
 </p>
 <snippet language="java" line-numbers="true" runnable="false">
  <snippet-file id="code">
   public static void mergeSort(int[] b, int h, int k) { 
    if (h &gt;= k)  return;  // if b[h..k] has size 0 or 1 
    int e= (h + k) / 2; 
    mergeSort(b, h, e);      // Sort b[h..e] 
    mergeSort(b, e + 1, k);   // Sort b[e+1..k] 
    merge(b, h, e, k);           // Merge the 2 segments 
}
  </snippet-file>
 </snippet>
 <p>
  For example, array B has 8 items in it.  Mergesort will divide array B log(8) times, which is equal to 3.  Draw this out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Visualization of division of array B of size 8 in merge sort:
 </p>
 <p>
  [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] (Before division)
 </p>
 <p>
  [1,2,3,4]   [5,6,7,8]  -  (level 1)
 </p>
 <p>
  [1,2]   [3,4]   [5,6]   [7,8]  -  (level 2)
 </p>
 <p>
  [1]   [2]   [3]   [4]   [5]   [6]   [7]   [8]  -  (level 3)
 </p>
 <p>
  As you can see, merge-sort splits array B of length 8, three times.  log(8) = 3.
 </p>
 <p>
  At each level, the merge method (which you can find on javahypertext) will take o(n) time.
 </p>
 <p>
  This would result in the time complexity of mergesort being n*log(n).
 </p>
 <p>
  Merge-sort's best and worst time complexity are both n*log(n), but this may be different for other algorithms.
 </p>
 <p>
  Also for the purpose of this explanation, array B is already sorted so that I am able to answer your question in an efficient amount of time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Note: log has base of 2.

   Yes! Don't memorize time complexities.
  </p>
  <p>
   Know the algorithms and you can figure them out.
  </p>
  <p>
   You should be able to develop those algorithms from specifications. Practice doing that. Once you can write the algorithm down, you can figure out the time/space complexity.
  </p>
  <p>
   Practice figuring them out, because you gain skill doing that practice.
