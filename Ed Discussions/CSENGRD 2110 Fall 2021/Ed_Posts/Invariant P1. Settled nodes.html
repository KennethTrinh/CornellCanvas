  "For a settled node s, at least one shortest v-s path contains only settled nodes and d[s] is its distance."
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I feel like this is saying that there's other shortest paths from v to s except those paths don't contain just settled nodes...
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Is it the shortest, though, if there's other short paths?

  There could be 4 different ways to get from  v to s, all of length 100, and all other ways to get from v to s have length &gt; 100. So there are 4 shortest paths. That's why we can't always talk about THE shortest path from v to s.

  The sentence is trying to convey that
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1. for s in the settled set, d[s] IS the length of
  <break>
  </break>
  the shortest path from v to s over ALL paths.
  <break>
  </break>
  2. At least one of those shortest paths contains
  <break>
  </break>
  only nodes in the settled set.

  I hope this helps.
