  Do we need to use the form c*2^y in our answer?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I read the pinned post but it didn't clarify whether we needed to follow the javadoc comment or the comment under the method header. One says return the value of c the other says return n.

  Why should you need that? c and y are NOT program variables. They are "thought" variables used in describing the algorithm.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Look at the spec (revised as per the item in pinned note Assignment A2);\:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Any positive integer n can be written in this form: c*2^y, where
  <break>
  </break>
  c &gt; 0 and c is odd and y &gt;= 0.  Return the value c.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Your program does not have to have a variable x. Suppose n is  5 * 2^4 = 5*16 = 80. Then return the value 5.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Now look at what the hint in the method says to do:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Write a while-loop that continually divides n by 2 until n is odd. Then return n.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Suppose n = 2*2^4 = 80. If you divide n by 2 4 times you get n = 5*2^0 = 5, which is the value that should be returned.
