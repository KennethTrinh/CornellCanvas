 I completed todo 8, and was testing the game. After I click the dot, and it turns red, I am still able to get in a few clicks before it respawns, and therefore the score goes up multiple times instead of just once. Are those clicks supposed to go through after the dot turns red?

  Once the dot turns red, clicking on it should not increase the score.

  Read the specification of checkHit, carefully, make sure you implemented it properly.
