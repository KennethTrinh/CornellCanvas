  As I understand it, isn't the returned value of compareTo supposed to be positive if this object is "greater" than ob? I understand the second return statement, because decreasing priority is "greater" in this context. But if the larger one is processed first, then say this object has size 4 and ob has size 3â€” if this object and ob have the same priority, then this object will be processed after ob because 3-4 is negative. So is the first return statement reversed? Or am I misunderstanding the question?

  Here is how I like to solve these problems that require descending order.

 <paragraph>
  Always return ob's value minus value.
