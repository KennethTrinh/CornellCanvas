  You had slides that said something like this
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  4..6  is the set of values 4, 5, and 6
  <break>
  </break>
  4..5 is the set of values  4 and 5
  <break>
  </break>
  4..4 is the set of one value: 4
  <break>
  </break>
  4..3 is the set of 0 values.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Therefore,  b[h..k] is the array segment consisting of b[h], b[h+1], b[h+2], ..., b[k].
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  And, something like. b[h..k] &lt;= 0 means: Every element of array segment b[h..k] is less than or equal to 0.
