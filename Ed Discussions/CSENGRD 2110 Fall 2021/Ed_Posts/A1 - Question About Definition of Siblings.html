 Hello, everyone! I just had a quick question about what would be considered "siblings" for the "getSibs" method in assignment one (super sorry if the text outlines this).  Would two elephants be considered siblings
 <i>
  only
 </i>
 if
 <i>
  both
 </i>
 parents were the same? So, for example, would half-siblings (such as same mother but different father) come up as true or false in "getSibs"? Thank you in advance, and I am sorry if I missed this on the assignment directions.
</p>

  <b>
   Note
  </b>
  : two elephants are siblings if (1) they are not the same object and (2) they have a non-null mom or non-null dad in common.
