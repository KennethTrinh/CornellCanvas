  Hello, everyone! I just had a quick question about what would be considered "siblings" for the "getSibs" method in assignment one (super sorry if the text outlines this).  Would two elephants be considered siblings
  <italic>
   only
  </italic>
  if
  <italic>
   both
  </italic>
  parents were the same? So, for example, would half-siblings (such as same mother but different father) come up as true or false in "getSibs"? Thank you in advance, and I am sorry if I missed this on the assignment directions.
