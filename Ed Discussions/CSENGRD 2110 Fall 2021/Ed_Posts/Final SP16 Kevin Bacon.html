  I know that the HashMap work contains actors, but why do we call it work?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Does depths contain the distance from actor to other actors, where Integer is that distance?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Would depth= 0 for the actor but be more than 0 for the coactors in the depths HashMap for actor?
