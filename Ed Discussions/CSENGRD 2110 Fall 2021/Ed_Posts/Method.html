  For areSibs, I understand the precondition states that if e is null, they cannot be siblings, and it returns false; however, we cannot assert this (since e can be null), and this cannot be returned. How can I approach this?

  areSibs doesn't have a precondition. You should be checking if e is null or not to determine if areSibs returns true or false

  NO. Do not use try-catch. There is absolutely no reasonable use for it in A1.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  In areSibs,  the spec is:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  /** Return value of "this elephant and e are siblings." (note: if e is null they can't be
  <break>
  </break>
  * siblings, so false is returned). */
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Look, if e is null, false should be returned. Implement that.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  There is nothing to assert, since there is no precondition.
