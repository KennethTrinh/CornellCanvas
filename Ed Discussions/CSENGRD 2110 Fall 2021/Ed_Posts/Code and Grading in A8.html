  Just wanted to confirm that these 2 points are true:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1. Each of our runs will be given 10-12 seconds to finish, not the entire set of 30 runs on the spreadsheet.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. Our grade will depend on our average score -- our code itself will not be looked at/graded.
 </paragraph>

  Thank you!

  1. Yes,

 <paragraph>
  2. We look at code only if the grade is really low (well below 85) and we might be able to raise the grade by looking at the code.
