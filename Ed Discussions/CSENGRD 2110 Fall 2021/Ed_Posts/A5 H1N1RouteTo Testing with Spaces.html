  While working on the tests for H1N1RouteTo, I noticed that all my tests only worked if there was one space between each letter after the ",". Is this functionality acceptable or must I make it operable without having the spaces in the expected result? And if this is not acceptable, how would I go about resolving it?

  For reference:

  [A, B, C] would work successfully

 <paragraph>
  [A,B,C] would fail

  Testing H1N1RouteTo uses method getNames(route). Look at the specification of getNames.
