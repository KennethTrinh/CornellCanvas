 While working on the tests for H1N1RouteTo, I noticed that all my tests only worked if there was one space between each letter after the ",". Is this functionality acceptable or must I make it operable without having the spaces in the expected result? And if this is not acceptable, how would I go about resolving it?

 For reference:
</p>
<p>
 [A, B, C] would work successfully
</p>
<p>
 [A,B,C] would fail
</p>

  Testing H1N1RouteTo uses method getNames(route). Look at the specification of getNames.
