 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 I wanted clarification on why after deleting "Gries" and setting a tombstone, we don't insert "Grant" in index 5 (place of the tombstone) rather than probing all the way to index 2? Wouldn't it serve the same purpose as the tombstone to have a value there?
</p>
<p>
 Thanks!
</p>

  You have to probe all the way to a null to Steven --Steven might be in there already.
