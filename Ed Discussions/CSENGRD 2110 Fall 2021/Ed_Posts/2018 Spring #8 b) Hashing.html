  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I wanted clarification on why after deleting "Gries" and setting a tombstone, we don't insert "Grant" in index 5 (place of the tombstone) rather than probing all the way to index 2? Wouldn't it serve the same purpose as the tombstone to have a value there?

  Thanks!

  You have to probe all the way to a null to Steven --Steven might be in there already.
