  Will there be some sort of CMS quiz where we click "yes" or "no" saying that we accept our preliminary grade and we won't be taking the final? How will the admin/professors know that we're choosing to not take the exam and that we shouldn't receive INCs?

  Yes, we will formally poll the class in order to determine your choice.  Please continue to carefully monitor your e-mail and Canvas for the next few days (while also getting home safe).
