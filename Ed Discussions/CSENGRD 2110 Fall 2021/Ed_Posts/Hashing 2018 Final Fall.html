 Hi! I am wondering about part(b) why doesn't "grant" be not be put in the place for "Gries" since they both have the same length and the b[5] has been empty after removing?
</p>
<p>
 Thanks!

  Remember that removing does NOT set the bucket to null. Instead, it puts in a tombstone, saying that there was a value and it has been removed.
