  The assignment says we can only use boolean expressions to define isOlder. Does this mean we can use "?" and ":" as taught in class?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Also, should the function return false if the two elephants were born in the same month and year?

  No, you cannot use the conditional expression with "?" and ":", as it is essentially an if-statement. (The conditional expression does evaluate a boolean expression, though: please see the JavaHyperText for more details)

  isOlder() should return the value of "this elephant is older than e." This statement would not be true for elephants of the same age.

  Here's a hint. Right down in English what it means for one date (year1, month1) to be before  another (year2, month2). Then just translate that English into java.
