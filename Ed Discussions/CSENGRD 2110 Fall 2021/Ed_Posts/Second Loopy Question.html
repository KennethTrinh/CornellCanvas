  For the second loopy question, for the example below, how are we able to write k&lt;n by looking at the restrictions on k in the invariant P? Where does the "k&lt;n" come from ?

  You can see from P and R that when the loop terminates, k = n makes sense. For
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  k = n and P implies  s is the sum of m..n-1, which is what we want.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Therefore, the loop should continue as long as k != n.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  We know that k is increasing, therefore, instead of k != n we can use k &lt; n.

  I still don't quit understand why k = n makes sense by pattern matching. What's the question to ask when trying to figure out the  k = n makes sense in terms of the sum or is there something else that you're considering?

  You know that P is true:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  s = sum of b[0..k-1]  and m &lt;= k &lt;= n
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  You want to stop when R is true:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  s = sum of b[0..n-1]  and m &lt;= k &lt;= n
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Compare what is true, P, with what you want, R. If k = n, they say the same thing.
