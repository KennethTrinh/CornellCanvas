 Why are the owners here compared using ==? owner is of type student, which isn't a primitive type, so I would have thought it would have used equals()? Is this because the pointers should point back to the same owner? if so, would equals() still have worked in this case?

 whereas in this case, the colors for each of the individual vehicles exist separately in memory? Thank you!

  Read the specification, it always depends on what is to be implemented.
 </p>
 <p>
  The specification says "and the owners are the same object" that means that wonder and as.owner contain the same pointer. Use  ==  for that.
