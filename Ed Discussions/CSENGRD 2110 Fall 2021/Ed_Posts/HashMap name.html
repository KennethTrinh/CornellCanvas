  Hello,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I'm ready to submit A7, but I was just wondering about the comment that the HashMap should have a suitable name. Is the name "S" suitable for the HashMap? It doesn't represent the settled set since it contains frontier nodes, but it seems like a good name given that the abstract algorithm uses the same variable name

  No, a TA recommended me not to do that.

  Why would you call it  S? Does it contain only nodes in the settled set?
