 What's the strategy for doing these types of problems? I'm able to write pre/in/post order traversals given a tree, but I can't seem to reason through the opposite. I can see that A would be the root. Thanks for any help.

  Yes, A is the root.
 </p>
 <p>
  By the inorder traversal, you know FDBH are part of the left subtree and CGE are part of the right subtree of the root.
 </p>
 <p>
  By preorder traversal rules, you know that C is the right child of the root, and B is the left child of the root.
 </p>
 <p>
  Can you see how to figure out the rest of the tree?
