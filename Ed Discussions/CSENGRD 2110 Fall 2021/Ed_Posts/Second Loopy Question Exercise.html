  For this exercise, we have to find the loop condition. I don't understand why k cannot be equal to m. Doesn't m also have to be added to the final sum of the loop?

  The loop condition B is such that when !B &amp;&amp; P =&gt; R is true, then execution of the loop stops. In this case, if k were to equal m (as the loop condition) , then intuitively, R is satisfied, so we should exit the loop. We wouldn't even need to increment k at that point or make any progress towards satisfying R. If k != m (or specifically, k&gt;m), we can make progress to satisfying the loop condition.
