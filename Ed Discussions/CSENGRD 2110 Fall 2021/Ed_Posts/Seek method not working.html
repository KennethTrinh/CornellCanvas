  I tried writing a seek method using the dfs implementation of java hypertext, but it doesn't work. I have a statement at the beginning of the method:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  if(state.distanceToRing() == 0) return;
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Even with this statement, the mcdiver does not stop at the ring and continues to move until he returns to his original position. I tried putting other versions of the statement within the for-loop of the dfs call, but those resulted in an error stating that the ID passed to the moveTo method was not adjacent to the current tile.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I'm not sure how to modify dfs for the mcdiver to stop moving at the ring.
