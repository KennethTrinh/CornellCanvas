 I tried writing a seek method using the dfs implementation of java hypertext, but it doesn't work. I have a statement at the beginning of the method:
</p>
<p>
 if(state.distanceToRing() == 0) return;
</p>
<p>
 Even with this statement, the mcdiver does not stop at the ring and continues to move until he returns to his original position. I tried putting other versions of the statement within the for-loop of the dfs call, but those resulted in an error stating that the ID passed to the moveTo method was not adjacent to the current tile.
</p>
<p>
 I'm not sure how to modify dfs for the mcdiver to stop moving at the ring.
