 When I run a6 and start the game, I am able to click a dot multiple times (after the initial click and the turn to red), and the score continues to increment instead of being 1 point for every dot. I'm not sure how I can fix this.

  I had this problem initially.  make sure you set isHit to true every time you click on a dot.  Before you click the dot, make sure isHit is false.  Also make sure the game is active when you attempt to hit a target.

   I believe I have this all implemented, but I'm still seeing the multiple clicks and score increases happening.

    I recommend adding debugging prints to your
    <code>
     checkHit()
    </code>
    function.  Print whether the target was previously hit, whether the current click qualifies as a hit, and what your return value is.  Compare this triplet of values against the specification, and you should be able to identify your bug.
