    I'll chime in also to say that I also have not recieved any email like this after much searching, so it may be a wide spread issue

     Please search for an e-mail with the subject line "[CS 2110] Prelim 2 grades", from "CS Course Management No-Reply Address" &lt;cscms-noreply@cornell.edu&gt;, sent Friday, Nov 19, at 3:36pm EST.  If you are not receiving whole-class e-mails from CMS, then you are missing essential course information.

  The email sent out on Nov 19, 2021 at 3:36 PM says "More details regarding statistics and the interpretation of grades will come after regrade requests have been processed (we need to ensure there were no systematic errors in applying the rubric)."
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, it appears that they are not releasing statistics yet.

   Not until all regrade requests are completed.
