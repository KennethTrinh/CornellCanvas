  I was trying to implement TODO 3 with the code:
 </paragraph>
 <pre>startButton.addActionListener(
            (ActionEvent ae) -&gt; GameComponent.startGame());</pre>
 <paragraph>
  My code didn't compile and Eclipse said "Cannot make a static reference to the non-static method startGame() from type GameComponent". Additionally, Eclipse said on the GameComponent constructor: "The serializable class GameComponent does not declare a static final serialVersionUID field of type long". Is this supposed to happen? If not what should I check and if so how should I approach TODO 3. Thanks.

  <code>
   GameComponent
  </code>
  is the name of a class.  Attempting to invoke a method on a class name only makes sense of that method is
  <code>
   static
  </code>
  .  (And you should ignore Eclipse's warning about serial versions.)

  Also, please refrain from including code snippets in public posts for this assignment - several of the TODOs only require a single line of code to complete them.  Try to ask questions in more general terms.
