  And if it does, will a subclass of the non-abstract class have to implement that non-abstract function still?

  The only difference between an abstract class and a regular class is that one cannot create objects of the abstract class --the new-expression for an abstract class won't compile.

  Based on that, you should be able to answer your question yourself. Please give us your answer and we will tell you whether it is right or wrong.

  A non-abstract class can have an abstract function and all members of the subclass must implement that abstract function.

  No. A non-abstract class cannot have an abstract method.

  Only abstract classes (and interfaces) van have abstract methods.
