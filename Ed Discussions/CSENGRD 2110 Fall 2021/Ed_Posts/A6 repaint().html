  What does repaint() do? How does it differ from paintDot() when I have to update the color of the dot? It seems like both work in my code for TODO 8.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Actually, it appears I don't need either paintDot() or repaint(), the dot will still turn red if I click it. Why is this?
