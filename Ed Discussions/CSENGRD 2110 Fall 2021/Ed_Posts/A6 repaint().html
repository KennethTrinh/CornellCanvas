 What does repaint() do? How does it differ from paintDot() when I have to update the color of the dot? It seems like both work in my code for TODO 8.
</p>
<p>
 Actually, it appears I don't need either paintDot() or repaint(), the dot will still turn red if I click it. Why is this?

  repaint() is a method in superclass JPanel. Please bring up the API documentation for JPanel
 </p>
 <p>
  (you can google       Jpanel java 8)
 </p>
 <p>
  and search for     repaint   and click it and read what it says that method does.

   The
   <code>
    repaint()
   </code>
   method, and how it compares to other
   <code>
    JComponent
   </code>
   paint methods, was discussed in Lecture 17.
