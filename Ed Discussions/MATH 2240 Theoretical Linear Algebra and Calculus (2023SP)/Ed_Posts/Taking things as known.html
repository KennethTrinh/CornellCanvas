  Can we take for known that the rational numbers are countable? And that integrating a bounded function over a region of volume $0$ gives $0$? And that we can do substitutions/integration by parts/etc in one-variable integrals?

  Yes, the rational numbers are countable. The second statement should be briefly justified. General substitutions are covered in Section 4.7, but I think single variable substitutions and integration by parts is probably fine.

  In one-variable calculus integrals of continuous functions are defined as limits of Riemann sums.  We proved in class that this agrees with the upper/lower sum definition of the Riemann integral.  So we are now free to apply the theorems of one-variable calculus, such as the fundamental theorem, the substitution formula, etc.
