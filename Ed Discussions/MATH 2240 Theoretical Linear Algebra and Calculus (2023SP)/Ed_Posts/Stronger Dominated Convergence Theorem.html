 If $f_1, f_2, f_3, \dots$ is a sequence of L-integrable functions from $\mathbb R^n$ to $\mathbb R$, $f:\mathbb R^n\to \mathbb R$ such that
</p>
<p>
 $$
</p>
<p>
 \lim_{k\to \infty}f_k(\vec x) = f(\vec x)
</p>
<p>
 $$

 almost everywhere, and there is an L-integrable function $F:\mathbb R^n\to \mathbb R$ such that for almost all $\vec x$, there exists $K$ such that for $k \geq K$,
</p>
<p>
 $$
</p>
<p>
 |f_k(\vec x)| \leq F(\vec x)|
</p>
<p>
 $$
</p>
<p>
 then does it follow that $f$ is L-integrable and
</p>
<p>
 $$
</p>
<p>
 \int_{\mathbb R^n}f(\vec x)|d^n\vec x| = \lim_{k\to \infty}\int_{\mathbb R^n}f_k(\vec x)|d^n\vec x|

  No.  Your $K$ may depend on $x$, which invalidates the conclusion.

   Counterexample.

  Let $f_k=k\boldsymbol{1}_{(0,1/k]}$ and $f=F=0$.  Then $f_k$ and $F$ are L-integrable.  Also $\lim_{k\to\infty}f_k(x)=f(x)$ for all $x$.  In fact, for each $x$ there is a $K$ such that $f_k(x)=0$ for $k\ge K$.  (Namely $K=\lceil1/x\rceil$ works for $x\in(0,1]$ and any $K$ works for $x\not\in(0,1]$.)  Thus $|f_k(x)|\le F(x)$ for $k\ge K$.  But $\lim_{k\to\infty}\int f_k=1$ and $\int\lim_{k\to\infty}f_k=0$ (see Example 4.11.3 case 2).

  However, if you replace "for almost all $x$, there exists $K$ such that for $k\ge K\dots$" with "there exists $K$ such that for almost all $x$ and for all $k\ge K\dots$", then you get a true statement, as you can see by applying the Dominated Convergence Theorem to the tail $(f_k)_{k\ge K}$ of the sequence.

   I think the answer is yes, only because you can simply truncate the first $K$ terms of your sequence and apply Dominated Convergence to the remaining sequence. However, I am generally skittish about weakening hypotheses because we may allow new counterexamples to appear, but it seems like there's a pretty tame transformation/argument you can make to fit whatever sequence of functions you want to to the Theorem 4.11.19 as stated.

   EDIT: this is incorrect, see Prof. Sjamaar's answer above.
