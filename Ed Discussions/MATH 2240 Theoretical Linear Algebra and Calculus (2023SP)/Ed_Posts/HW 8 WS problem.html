  Are we determining whether P(X) has surface area iff X has surface area in the sense of Def 5.3.1, with our X being the definition’s U and our P(X) being the definition’s M (and vice versa for the other direction)?

  No.  Definition 5.3.1 only defines volume of a manifold.  Our $X$ is not necessarily a manifold, but it is a subset of the manifold $S$.  See the last line of Definition 5.3.2 for the definition of volume of a subset of a manifold.

 <paragraph>
  So we have two manifolds, $S$ and $M$, and two subsets, $X\subseteq S$ and $P(X)\subseteq M$.  You must show that $X$ and $P(X)$ have the same area ($2$-dimensional volume) in the sense of Definition 5.3.2.
