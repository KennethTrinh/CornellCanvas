 Are the chapters from the first prelim (4.1-4.10) included in the final exam, or is it just the things from after the prelim?

  The exam will concentrate on the material covered after the prelim.  Of course this material builds on the previous chapters, and you will be expected to know the older material in as far as necessary.
