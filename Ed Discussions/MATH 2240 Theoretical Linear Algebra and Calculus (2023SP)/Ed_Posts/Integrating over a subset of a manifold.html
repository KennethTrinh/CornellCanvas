 In a couple of questions we are asked to integrate a $k$-form $\varphi$ over a subset $X$ of an oriented manifold $M\subseteq \mathbb R^n$, such that $X$ is not itself a manifold. Does this mean integrating $\varphi$ with respect to a $C^1$ map $\gamma: C\to X$ such that $\gamma$ is the restriction to $C$ of an orientation preserving parametrization of $M$ and $C$ is a pavable subset of $\mathbb R^k$ such that $\gamma(C) = X$?

  I think Prof. Sjamaar's answer in #61 might be helpful here. Loosely, you want to define a $C^1$ function with open domain that contains the domain of the provided parameterization and matches it on that domain. I think the orientation information doesn't really add much to that answer.
