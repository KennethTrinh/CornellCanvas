  In section 5.2 of Hubbard's book, they give a "small catalog of parametrizations" for manifolds (though not as a formal theorem with proofs), which includes using graphs of C1 functions. Can we justify our parametrizations by referring to this "catalog" (instead of checking the conditions of the definition directly)?

  This "small catalog" is really no more than a sketch of two general strategies: graphs and surfaces of revolution.  As you rightly point out, there are unfortunately no precise statements made in this subsection of the book.  So I would advise, instead of referring to this subsection, verifying the conditions of the definition directly.
