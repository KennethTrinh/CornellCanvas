  Suppose $\gamma$ is a parameterization from $U$ to $M$ but $M$ is written in spherical coordinates. Basically $\phi(M)$ is in normal coordinates and $\phi$ is a change of variables formula. Can I assume that $\phi(\gamma)$ is still a parameterization?

  If $\gamma\colon t\mapsto(r(t),\theta(t),\phi(t))$ is a parametrization of a  curve in $(r,\theta,\phi)$-space and $S\colon\mathbf{R}^3\to\mathbf{R}^3$ is the spherical coordinate map, then it may happen that $S\circ\gamma$ is not a parametrization of a curve in $(x,y,z)$-space.  To give a dumb example, if $\gamma(t)=(0,t,0)$ (the $\theta$-axis), then $S(\gamma(t))=(0,0,0)$ for all $t$.

  But I think in Problem 5.3.3 the author is implicitly assuming that the curve $\gamma$ is such that $S\circ\gamma$ is a parametrization of a curve in $(x,y,z)$-space.
