 If $f(x)=g(x)$ for all $x\in\mathbb R$, is it safe to imply that $\int_{\mathbb R}f(x)=\int_{\mathbb R}g(x)$?
</p>
<p>
 Would $\int_{\mathbb R}x^2\mathbf1_{(a,b]}=\int_{\mathbb R}x^2\mathbf1_{(0,b]}-\int_{\mathbb R}x^2\mathbf1_{(0,a]}$, for example? If so, do we have to prove it?

  Just a note that your follow-up question (the second line) reveals too much about the solution to 4.1.6. Please try to come up with a non-homework example that illustrates your question in future posts. Thank you!

   If $f$ and $g$ are equal on all inputs (assuming their domains/codomains are equal), they are equal as functions, so their integrals are also clearly equal (one could just replace $f$ with $g$ everywhere). Recall that at a basic level functions are also sets, so the condition you've provided is equivalent to their equality as sets.
  </p>

   As for your second question, you should briefly justify this with the linearity of the integral.
