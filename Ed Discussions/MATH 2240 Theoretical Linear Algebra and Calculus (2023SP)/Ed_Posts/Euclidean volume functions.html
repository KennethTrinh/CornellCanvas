 Should we assume $k\leq n$? Because otherwise the volume would just be $0$ (and it wouldn't be possible to check normalization as there are only $n$ vectors $e_i$)

  You are right that for $k &gt; n$, there is no Euclidean $k$-volume function on $\mathbb R^n$. As you observed, this is because normalization is impossible. So yes, you can and must assume that $k \le n$.
