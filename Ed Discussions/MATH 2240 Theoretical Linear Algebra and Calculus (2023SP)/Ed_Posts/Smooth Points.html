  Suppose we have a subset $X\subset M$ of a $k$-manifold $M$ such that $\partial_MX\cap X=\emptyset$. Definition 6.6.2 states that $\vec x\in\partial_MX$ is a smooth point of $\partial_MX$ if there exists a neighborhood $V\subseteq\mathbb R^n$ that contains $\vec x$ and a function $g:V\cap M\rightarrow\mathbb R$ such that $g(\vec x)=0$ and $X\cap V=\{g≥0\}$. However, $\partial_MX$ is not a part of $X$ and includes values of $g^{-1}(0)$, so wouldn't this mean $X\cap V≠\{g≥0\}$ for any neighborhood $V$,and that $\partial_MX$ has no smooth points when $\partial_MX\cap X=\emptyset$?

  That's right.  For $x$ to be a smooth point of the boundary, $x$ has to be contained in $X$ itself.
