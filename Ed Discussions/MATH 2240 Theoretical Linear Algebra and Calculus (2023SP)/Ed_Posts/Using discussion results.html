 Can we use results that were proved in discussion section or should we prove them again?

  It depends on the nature of the result. I would say since I'm not at discussion, you should restate the proposition you're trying to use and at least give a sketch of the proof of the proposition. If using the proposition essentially kills the problem or is otherwise a major component of your solution, you should flesh out the proof of the proposition more.
