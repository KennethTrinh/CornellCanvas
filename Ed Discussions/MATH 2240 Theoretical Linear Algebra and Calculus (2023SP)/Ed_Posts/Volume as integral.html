  I'm having some troubles with orientations. If we have some $k$-manifold $C$ oriented by $\Omega$, is there some way to determine whether $\int_C dx_1\wedge dx_2\wedge ...\wedge dx_k$ is $vol_k(C)$ or $-vol_k(C)$,  directly from the orientation? Or is there no other way than finding a parametrization, checking if it is orientation preserving/reversing and computing the integral with the parametrization?

  Keeping in mind that forms can only be integrated over

  manifolds, the notation $C$ needs to denote a manifold together with an orientation. The integral $\int_C dx_1 \wedge dx_2 \wedge \cdots \wedge dx_k$ is thus the signed volume of $C$, which will be positive if $C$ is positively-oriented (with respect to the orientation $\text{sgn} \, dx_1 \wedge dx_2 \wedge \cdots \wedge dx_k$) and negative otherwise (assuming $C$ is nondegenerate, e.g. not empty).

  In summary, $\int_C dx_1 \wedge dx_2 \wedge \cdots \wedge dx_k$ is $\text{vol}_k(C)$ if $C$ has the same orientation as $\text{sgn} \, dx_1 \wedge dx_2 \wedge \cdots \wedge dx_k$, and is $-\text{vol}_k(C)$ if $C$ has the opposite orientation.
