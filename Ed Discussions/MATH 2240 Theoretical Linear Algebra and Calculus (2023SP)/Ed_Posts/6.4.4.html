 Is there a way to justify that $\gamma(X)$ has three dimensional volume zero without saying that it is the compact part of a two dimensional manifold (since we have to justify that the 2 dimensional manifold is a manifold)?

  Not with the theorems that we have covered in class.  But it's not that much work to show that $\gamma(X)$ is contained in a finite union of manifolds.
