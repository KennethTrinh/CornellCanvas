  If I let
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  f_k\left(x\right)=\mathbf{1}_{[a,c_k]}f(x)
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  and $c_k$ converges to $b$ when $k$ goes to infinity. And I also let $c_k\in [a,b)$ for every $c_k$. If this satisfies the dominated convergence theorem, can I conclude that
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  \lim_{c\to b }\int_{a}^{c}f(x)dx=\lim_{k\to\infty}\int_{R}f_k(x)dx=\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  In other words, I think this is true if $c_k$ to be any sequence but I added some constraints so will that still be true?

  I'm not sure exactly what you're asking, but you seem to be asking several questions at once.  Let me just say that in this problem you need to use the following facts:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1. A Math 2230 fact about limits of functions: $\lim_{x\to x_0}g(x)=a$ if and only if $\lim_{k\to\infty}g(x_k)=a$ for every sequence $(x_k)$ that converges to $x_0$;
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. The monotone and dominated convergence theorems.
