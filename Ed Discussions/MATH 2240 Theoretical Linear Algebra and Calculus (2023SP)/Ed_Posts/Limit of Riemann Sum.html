  How could we show that the above limit is a Riemann sum if it does not use a nested partition? I see that it would be the integral of f(x) from 0 to 1, but the partition when N = 3 is not nested inside the partition when N = 2 (the interval [1/3, 2/3] straddles [0, 1/2] and [1/2, 1]).

  Let $\mathcal{P}_N$ be the paving of the unit interval $[0,1]$ into subintervals $[k/N,(k+1)/N]$.  You observe correctly that the sequence of pavings $\mathcal{P}_N$ is not nested.  But it has a property that is almost as good, namely that for each $N_1$ and $N_2$ there exists $N$ such that $\mathcal{P}_N$ is a common refinement of $\mathcal{P}_{N_1}$ and $\mathcal{P}_{N_2}$.  (Take $N$ to be the least common multiple of $N_1$ and $N_2$.)  We say that $\mathcal{P}_N$ is a

  of pavings.  You can use this to show that the above limit exists and is equal to the Riemann integral if $f$ is Riemann integrable.

  Homework problems 4.7.1 and 4.7.2 involve Riemann sums for directed systems of pavings.  You  may use that Theorem 4.7.4 is valid for directed systems of pavings.
