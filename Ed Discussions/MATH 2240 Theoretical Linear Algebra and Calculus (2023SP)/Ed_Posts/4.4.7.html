  Can we write a number such as 1.1 using only the digits 1-6, or do we consider it as ...001.100... and not permit it?

  If we required all possible digits to the left of the decimal point to be zero, there would be no numbers which could be written using only the digits 1-6. As far as to the right I would be inclined to say that "1.1" is a way of writing that number using only the digits 1-6, but disallowing implicit zeroes due to finite termination won't change the measure of the resulting set. (Why?) Whatever interpretation you choose, state it explicitly and briefly justify your decision.

  Clarification in case anyone is tempted to say that there are no numbers which can be written using only the digits 1-6, and so the measure of the set of such numbers is zero: Requiring that there be no possible leading zeroes is an unreasonable requirement, and solutions using that requirement will receive no credit.
