 The professor mentioned in office hours that the lower summation should count every row of dyadic cubes that contribute to the sum, but every row that contributes has to include at least one dyadic cube that is completely inside $T$. By counting those, I got a slightly different answer from just those that are contained between $x=0$ and $x=a$, but it approaches the same limit as $N$ approaches infinity. Is it okay to use?

  The problem says, "using upper and lower sums, compute the integral...".  That is what you have to do, not something else.  There may be different ways of computing the integral, but that is not what this problem is about.

  In an upper sum $U_N(f)$ or a lower sum $L_N(f)$ all but finitely many dyadic cubes $C_{\mathbf{k},N}$ contribute $0$ to the sum.  Deciding which cubes contribute a nonzero term to the sum requires some delicate book-keeping.  That is what this problem is about.
