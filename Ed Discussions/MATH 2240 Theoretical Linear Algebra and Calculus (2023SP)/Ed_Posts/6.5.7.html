 When describing paths along which the work-form is 0 or large, can we give an "informal" explanation (i.e., the way that Hubbard explains it in the margin of pg 600), or do we need to explicitly write down a curve, its parametrization, and calculate the work using its integral definition?

  An informal explanation will be OK here.  It will help if you include the paths in your sketch of the vector fields.
