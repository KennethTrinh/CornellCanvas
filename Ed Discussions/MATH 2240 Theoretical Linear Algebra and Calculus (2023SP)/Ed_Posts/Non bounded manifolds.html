 As far as I've understood from the book, I take that manifolds are not necessarily bounded. Does this mean that if we have a closed non bounded manifold (suppose the plane $x=0$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$) then it will have $3$-dimensional volume $0$, despite it being unbounded?

  Unfortunately Definition 5.2.1 requires the subset $X$ to be bounded.  Otherwise infinitely many dyadic cubes will intersect $X$ and the sum in equation (5.2.1) will be infinite, so $X$ cannot have $k$-dimensional volume $0$.  In particular a plane in $\mathbf{R}^3$ does not have $3$-dimensional volume $0$.
 </p>
 <p>
  Proposition 5.2.2 in the book is slightly misstated.  It should say: if $X$ is a
  <i>
   compact
  </i>
  subset of an $m$-manifold $M$ in $\mathbf{R}^n$, then $X$ has $k$-dimensional volume $0$ for any $k&gt;m$.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, there is a more general notion of having $k$-dimensional
  <i>
   measure
  </i>
  zero.  An $m$-dimensional linear subspace of $\R^n$ has $k$-dimensional
  <i>
   measure
  </i>
  $0$ for any $k&gt;m$.

   Would the second part of Definition 5.2.1 not allow $X$ to have $k$ dimensional volume $0$ even if it's unbounded?
  </p>
  <p>
   If so, then in problem 5.2.3, is there still a problem with taking $R = \infty$.

    You're quite right.  I had overlooked that.  The case of unbounded $X$ is covered in part 2 of Definition 5.2.1.

   Yes, a plane in $\mathbb R^3$ will have two-dimensional volume zero. This was incorporated into the definition of $k$-dimensional volume (5.2.1); clause (2) was not included in the original definition of volume in $\mathbb R^n$. Thus our definition of volume has changed now that we have seen Lebesgue integrals (or at least that is my interpretation of the authors' choice of terminology).
