  As far as I've understood from the book, I take that manifolds are not necessarily bounded. Does this mean that if we have a closed non bounded manifold (suppose the plane $x=0$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$) then it will have $3$-dimensional volume $0$, despite it being unbounded?

  Yes, a plane in $\mathbb R^3$ will have two-dimensional volume zero. This was incorporated into the definition of $k$-dimensional volume (5.2.1); clause (2) was not included in the original definition of volume in $\mathbb R^n$. Thus our definition of volume has changed now that we have seen Lebesgue integrals (or at least that is my interpretation of the authors' choice of terminology).

  Unfortunately Definition 5.2.1 requires the subset $X$ to be bounded.  Otherwise infinitely many dyadic cubes will intersect $X$ and the sum in equation (5.2.1) will be infinite, so $X$ cannot have $k$-dimensional volume $0$.  In particular a plane in $\mathbf{R}^3$ does not have $3$-dimensional volume $0$.

  Proposition 5.2.2 in the book is slightly misstated.  It should say: if $X$ is a
  <italic>
   compact
  </italic>
  subset of an $m$-manifold $M$ in $\mathbf{R}^n$, then $X$ has $k$-dimensional volume $0$ for any $k&gt;m$.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  However, there is a more general notion of having $k$-dimensional
  <italic>
   measure
  </italic>
  zero.  An $m$-dimensional linear subspace of $\R^n$ has $k$-dimensional
  <italic>
   measure
  </italic>
  $0$ for any $k&gt;m$.

  Would the second part of Definition 5.2.1 not allow $X$ to have $k$ dimensional volume $0$ even if it's unbounded?
 </paragraph>

 <paragraph>
  If so, then in problem 5.2.3, is there still a problem with taking $R = \infty$.

  You're quite right.  I had overlooked that.  The case of unbounded $X$ is covered in part 2 of Definition 5.2.1.
