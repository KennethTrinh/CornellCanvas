 Should we keep computing integrals with lower and upper sums or can we solve them like we used to do with what we know from before?

  We now know that Riemann sums are OK too.
 </p>
 <p>
  For one-dimensional integrals, if the integrand is continuous you can use the fundamental theorem of calculus.
 </p>
 <p>
  For higher-dimensional integrals we will learn new techniques as we go.
