 The book defines spherical coordinates as $\phi$ belonging to $\left(-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}\right)$. But shouldn't we include $-\frac{\pi}{2}$ and $\frac{\pi}{2}$ to include the $z$ axis?

  The formula in problem 5.2.3 clashes with that used in the main text.  I will post a correction shortly.

   This is true, but note that the omission is a set of measure zero. I figure that Hubbard likes having his domains being open sets, hence the omission.
