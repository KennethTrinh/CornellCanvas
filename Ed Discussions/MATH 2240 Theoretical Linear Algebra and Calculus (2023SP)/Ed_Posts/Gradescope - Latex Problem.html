  Every time I upload my homework to Gradescope, some of the stuff written in math mode gets deleted from the pdf (especially subscripts and superscripts). Is this happening to other people and does anyone know a way to prevent it?

  How are you compiling your LaTeX file? Overleaf? Have you checked the actual pdf downloaded/created from (whatever you're using) and do they appear there?

  I'm compiling with Overleaf, but the actual pdf created does not have any issues. Stuff only gets deleted when I upload the pdf to Gradescope.

  That's really strange -- I do see that there are blank spaces for your subscripts/superscripts in your submissions where there should be characters, and it only truncates the last character in a sub/superscript. Do the characters still appear on the pdf when it is downloaded from Overleaf? How are you downloading the pdf from Overleaf? There's a potential that maybe the pdf is compiled differently before it's downloaded, maybe... There really should not be any loss going from something on your computer to Gradescope so I'm wondering if something is changing from Overleaf to your computer.

  Additional comment: Sometimes LaTeX doesn't work out all formatting/references during a first compilation so it is a good idea to compile two or three times consecutively before submitting. Also any reasonable compiler produces extensive warnings and error messages, and it is a good idea to pay attention to those and see if you can address them. It is okay to have warnings as long as the output is good, but often warnings point to something going wrong that does affect the output.
