  Trying to build intuition for pavable sets. What are some examples or common cases when a set would not have an integrable indicator function or a well defined notion of volume?

  To begin with, a pavable set must be bounded.  An unbounded set cannot be pavable.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Among bounded sets, say subsets of the unit interval $[0,1]$, the following are not pavable: $\mathbf{Q}\cap[0,1]$ (the set of rationals between $0$ and $1$), $(\mathbf{R}\backslash\mathbf{Q})\cap[0,1]$ (the set of irrationals between $0$ and $1$), and the Cantor set.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  More generally, let $A$ be a bounded subset of $\mathbf{R}^n$ such that $A$ is dense in $\bar{A}$ and $\bar{A}\backslash A$ is dense in $\bar{A}$.  Then $A$ is not pavable.

  as a rule of thumb, a lot of bounded open/closed sets you should expect to be pavable! so constructions of non-pavable sets are a little tricky
