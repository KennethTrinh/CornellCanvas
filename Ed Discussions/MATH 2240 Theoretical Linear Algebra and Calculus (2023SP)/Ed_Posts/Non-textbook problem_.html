 Is "$X$ can be parameterized" a neccessary condition from "the volume of X is well defined"?

  No.  $X$ need not be a manifold and we haven't even defined what it means for a non-manifold to be parametrized.
 </p>
 <p>
  Use Definition 5.3.2 (where the subset is called $Y$): the $k$-dimensional volume of a subset $X$ of a $k$-dimensional manifold $M$ is well-defined if the indicator function $\boldsymbol{1}_X$ is R-integrable over $M$.

   May I assume that the manifold that this $X$ has well defined volume on is $S$? Or if $X$ has well defined volume then for all manifolds that it is a subset of holds the property in 5.3.2?

    Yes, you may assume it is $S$.
   </p>
   <p>
    A subset $X$ of a $k$-manifold $M$ having well-defined $k$-dimensional volume doesn't actually depend on $M$, although we did not establish that in class.
