  The change of variables theorem as stated in the book requires the Lipschitz condition on $D\Phi$ on some open neighborhood $U$ of the set $X$.  (The region we are calculating the volume of is $\Phi(X)$.)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Recall that Lipschitz conditions on $D\Phi$ often come for free, namely for maps $\Phi$ that are $C^2$ (Proposition 2.8.9).
