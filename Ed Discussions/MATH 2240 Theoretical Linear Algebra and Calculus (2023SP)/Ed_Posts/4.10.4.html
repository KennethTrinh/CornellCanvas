 Must the Lipschitz condition of the derivative of the change of variables map be satisfied across all of $\mathbb R^3$ or just within the bounded region we find the volume of?

  The change of variables theorem as stated in the book requires the Lipschitz condition on $D\Phi$ on some open neighborhood $U$ of the set $X$.  (The region we are calculating the volume of is $\Phi(X)$.)

 <p>
  Recall that Lipschitz conditions on $D\Phi$ often come for free, namely for maps $\Phi$ that are $C^2$ (Proposition 2.8.9).
