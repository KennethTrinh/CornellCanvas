 Figuring out how to fulfill all of your requirements can be really challenging - deciding what are the best classes to take and when to take them can be very overwhelming! But don’t worry we’re here to help! Not only is this event a great way to get to know WICC, ISSA, and DTI members, but we will also have a lot of upperclassmen there to share their past schedules, help you outline your course schedules, and give advice about different course loads! Come for some planning and boba!!
