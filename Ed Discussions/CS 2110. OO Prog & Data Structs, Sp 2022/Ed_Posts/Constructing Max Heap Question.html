  Add each value in turn to the heap. The first one results in this heap:
 </p>
 <p>
  -5
 </p>
 <p>
  Adding a value to the heap means to place it in the next position and bubble it up. Since this is a max-heap, adding 10 is results in
 </p>
 <p>
  -5              and then bubbling up give this:         10
  <break>
  </break>
  /                                                                                  /
  <break>
  </break>
  10                                                                                -5
 </p>

   Is there something in the directions that indicates that you complete it this way as opposed to placing all the elements into heap all at once and then bubbling them up from there?

     What would be the wording for it to be done the other way?

      They won’t ask you to add it all first then bubble it up, Ive not seen it before at all, but (I guess) something along the lines of, you’re given an array with elements…. construct a heap by bubbling up. (Again I haven’t seen this)
