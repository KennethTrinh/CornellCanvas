  I am also by Mattin's in Duffield if you would prefer to be in person.  Since this is the case, please comment on the ed post so I can keep track of the order to help people.

  If I am not in the main session of the zoom do not worry, I am most likely in a breakout room and will get to you as soon as possible. I will try to get to everyone and will stay on a little longer to make sure all questions are addressed.
