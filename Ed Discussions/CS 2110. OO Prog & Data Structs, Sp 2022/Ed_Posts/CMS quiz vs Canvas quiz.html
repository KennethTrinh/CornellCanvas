  Whatâ€™s the difference between them?  Can we assign the quiz on the same platform but name it differently? (Like all on canvas but separately listed as CMS quiz)

  Canvas quizzes are testing you on lecture material and are typically more difficult than CMS quizzes. CMS quizzes are reviews of JavaHyperText tutorials.

  Do they both count toward our grade or only the canvas quizzes?
