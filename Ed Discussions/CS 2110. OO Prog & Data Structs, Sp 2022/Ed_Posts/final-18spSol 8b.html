  I think the meaning of adding a Tomb(the crossed off "Gries") here is to show that there once exist an object, so one had better keep on looking for the target object after seeing the Tomb. But here, why do we need to keep probing for adding "Grant" instead of putting "Grant" in the place of crossed off "Gries"?

  Can you provide the hashing function just to double check something?

  Yeah like I thought, this happens because of the way tombstones work, just imagine an element is where the Gries is

  It makes sense when you are searching for some object to treat tombstones as an object added, but it doesn't make sense when I am adding a new object to the list. I am still confused about when can't we add "Grant" to the position of crossed off "Gries".

  The point of adding a tombstone is to reserve that spot forever. You cannot insert a new element where the tombstone was. If still confused please look back at the Hashing lecture/JHT where we discussed tombstones.

  So if tombstone is forever reserved. That means load factor cannot decrease even if we remove elements. Right? And the logic of “removing some to make more space” does not apply here since once you add an element, its bucket is forever unavailable?
