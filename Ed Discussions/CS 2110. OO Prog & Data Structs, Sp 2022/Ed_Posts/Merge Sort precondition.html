  Does Merge Sort only work on an array that has two sorted segments? Or can it sort a completely unsorted array?

  Merge only works on an array that has two sorted segments. Merge Sort can sort a completely unsorted array by recursively calling itself on the two halves of the array until we get to the base case, then using merge to put them back together.
