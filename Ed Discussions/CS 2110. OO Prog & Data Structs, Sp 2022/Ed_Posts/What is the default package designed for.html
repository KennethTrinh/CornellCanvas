  I'm curious about the function of default packages. Are they built for placing some classes directly in the src directory?

  Yes, the classed in the default directory go right in directory src.

  Find the Eclipse workspace on your hard drive and look at a project that has classes in the default directory and you will see those classes in src.

  When you are just playing around, writing some code, trying things out, it's easier no to use real packages for you code and just place all the files in the default directory.

  If you are writing an app or something that you may want to share with others, then using specific packages is the way to go.

  You'll learn more about the use of packages and "access modifiers" later in the course.
