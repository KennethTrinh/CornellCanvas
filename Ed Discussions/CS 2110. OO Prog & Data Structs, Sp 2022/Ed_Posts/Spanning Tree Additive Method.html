  In Lecture 22 (Spanning Trees), Slide 24, why doesn't the new edge connect 2 'unconnected' components instead of 'connected' components? If connected components were used, no edges would ever be added

  Three possible answers to my question are:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1. There is a typo.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. Rather than the spanning tree itself, 'connected' refers in some way to the original graph.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  3. I forgot how to think, and just in time for finals.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Which is it? Thanks
