 Regarding this:
</p>
<p>
 "f= node in F with minimum d value;
 <break>
 </break>
 Remove f from F, add it to S;"
</p>
<p>
 Are we supposed to poll from the minheap (to remove f) and then add to the hashmap for S and F (to add it to S)? I'm a bit confused if this would successfully add it to S or be redundant since it already should be in S if we were supposed to add f to the minheap and hashmap before the while loop (which I am also not sure about).
</p>
<p>
 I've looked at the handout and lecture notes and I am still confused.

  If the map holds S and F, then we wouldn't need to move something in the map back into itself. It would be redundant.
