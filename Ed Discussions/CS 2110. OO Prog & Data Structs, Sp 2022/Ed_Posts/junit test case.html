  The assignment instructions say to set the package for the PhD class to a1. But, for the Assignment A1. PhD Genealogy answers to common questions that was posted by the professor, it says what if a1 is not the default package? And it says our JUnit test case class should be on the default package. I am not sure whether to set it to package a1 or default.

  Both classes should be in whichever package the pdf instructions say they should be in. If that is the default package, they should be in the default package

  I misread the Assignment A1. PhD Geneaology notes. The answer to the question "what if a1 is not the default package" suggests that the a1 package should be the default package or below the src file.  But it isn't saying that when creating the JUnit test case class, the package should be set to default. Thanks for helping clear that up.
