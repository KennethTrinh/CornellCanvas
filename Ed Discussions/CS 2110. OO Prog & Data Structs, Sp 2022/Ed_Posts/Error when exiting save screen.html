 <pre>Exception in thread "AWT-EventQueue-0" java.lang.NullPointerException

 <paragraph>
  This doesn't have to do with gameplay, but when I exit the "save score" screen without actually saving, I get this message in the console (the game continues to function). Is this an issue i should be looking into?

  Yep.  Are you checking the return value from the save dialog?

  I was confused about this. I have an
  <bold>
   int
  </bold>
  saving the return value like the example from the java documentation (similar to this int returnVal = fc.showOpenDialog(FileChooserDemo.this);), but I dont know what to do with the return value.

  To be clear, the saving works, and I get the proper error when it fails, but the console message when I get out of the Save screen (not press exit, but rather press "Save", then decide to cancel), i get a console message i dont fully understand.

  There is a URL provided in the release code for TODO 15.  It is to the File Chooser section of the Swing Tutorial.  Please take a look at it.  It shows you what to do.
