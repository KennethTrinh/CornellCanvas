  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I am a little lost on how to fix the error mentioned in the title for TODO 9. I am using an anonymous function where the ActionEvent is "GameScore" and then it will use setText to update the score label. However, I am getting a syntax error for the part of the anonymous function where it is "-&gt;" and it says that I have a syntax error because it is an invalid AssignmentOperator. I am pretty sure that this is because I have written some other part of the anonymous function incorrectly, but I can't figure out which part.

  Without seeing the code/error I cannot be sure this is the specific issue you are referring to however, TODO 9 should not be using an ActionEvent. The listener in TODO 9 is a PropertyChangeListener. Therefore the event should be a PropertyChangeEvent. (Note that every listener type has a matching event type, this is by convention)
