  Frequently asked questions and concerns
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  0. Can you suggest a schedule for doing A1?
 </b>
 See below.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  1. When I create a JUnit testing class and then put in an assertEquals or assertThrows statement, I get an error.
 </b>
 See answer below.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  2. Should I put files in the default package?
 </b>
 NO. See answer below.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  3. How many times can I submit on the CMS
 </b>
 ? See answer below.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  4. I get a warning about my method specification because I am not using @param or @return
 </b>
 .
 <b>
  What do I do?
 </b>
 See answer below.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  5. Should we check for situations like a PhD is their own PhD or someone got their PhD in a year that is &lt; 0
 </b>
 ? See answer below.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  6. Can we add other methods to class PhD
 </b>
 ? Do not add other methods. There is no need for them.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  7. If I want to call constructor 1 from constructor 2, I can't put assert statements at the beginning of constructor 2. What do I do?
 </b>
 See answer below.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  8. Suppose my field for the number of advisees is nadv. Since nadv is private, from PhD object p (say), how can I reference/change nadv in PhD object q?
 </b>
 See answer below.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  9. May I use fields in PhDTest to reduce the number of declarations needed in methods in this class?
 </b>
 See answer below.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  10. How can I write this in Java? "this PhD and PhD p  are different"?
 </b>
 See answer below.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  11. What do I do if I get the error "The method assertThrows(Class&lt;AssertionError&gt;, () -&gt; {}) is undefined for the type PhDTest." ?
 </b>
 Press the mouse over the red x to the left. A small window should pop up, and one option in it is to import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertThrows; Select it so that it is imported.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  12. Do I need specifications of JUnit testing procedures? Do I have to put comments in them?
 </b>
 No. The important thing is to make the name of the testing procedure indicate what is being tested.
</p>

  ANSWERS
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  0. Can you suggest a schedule for doing A1?
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 Wed, 2 Feb. Read through the A1 handout. Read pages 1..2 carefully, scan the rest.
</p>
<p>
 Thu-Fri, 3-4 Feb. Do step 1 at the bottom of page 2: Create the project and class PhD.
 <break>
 </break>
 Do step 2 page 3: Put in declarations of the fields.
 <break>
 </break>
 Do step 3 on page 4. Create the JUnit testing class.
</p>
<p>
 Sat-Sun, 5-6 Feb. Write and test the methods of Group A.
</p>
<p>
 Mon, 8 Feb. Write and test the methods of Group B and C.
</p>
<p>
 Wed, 9 Feb. Write and test the methods of Group D and put in some tests for assert statements.
</p>
<p>
 Thu, 10 Feb. Carefully go over points 6..8 on pages 7..8. Submit, a day before the due date.
</p>

   1. When I create a JUnit testing class and then put in an assertEquals or assertThrows statement, I get an error.
  </b>
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 Press your mouse over the red x before a line with an assertEquals or assertThrows call that shows an error. A window will pop up suggesting the need for an import statement. Select that and let Eclipse put in the import statement.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  2. Should I put files in the default package? No.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 We want both PhD.java and PhDTest.java to be in package a1.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  3. How many times can I submit on the CMS
 </b>
 ? Submit as often as you like. Only the last one is graded.
</p>
<p>
 BUT DO NOT take this as an opportunity to submit every 3 minutes, submitting 15-20 times.
 <break>
 </break>
 Submit when you know it is done, but if later you see how to do something better, submit again.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  4. I get a warning about my method specification because I am not using @param or @return
 </b>
 .
 <b>
  What do I do?
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 Ignore the warnings and delete those @param things for now. We don't need them.
</p>
<p>
 Read about method specifications in our Style Guidelines: Visit JavaHyperText page and click "Style Guide" in the left part of the top navigation bar.

  5. Should we check for situations like a PhD is their own advisor or someone got their PhD in a year that is &lt; 0
 </b>
 ?
</p>
<p>
 No. Please implement the spec of each method exactly; do nothing more, nothing less.
</p>
<p>
 We are not attempting to create a completely realistic class to be used in a real life situation.
</p>
<p>
 We are attempting to teach you about OO in Java with a minimum amount of your time.
</p>
<p>

 <b>
  6. Can we add other methods to class PhD
 </b>
 ? Do not add other methods. There is no need for them.
</p>
<p>
 <break>
 </break>
 <b>
  7. If I want to call constructor 1 from constructor 2, I can't put assert statements at the beginning of constructor 2. What do I do?
 </b>
 <break>
 </break>
 If you are not contemplating calling one constructor from another, which hasn't been taught as of this writing, no need to read further.
</p>
<p>
 But the answer to this question appears in note #11.
</p>
<p>

 <b>
  8. Suppose my field for the number of advisees is nadv. Since nadv is private,
  <break>
  </break>
  from PhD object p (say), how can I reference/change nadv, the number of advisees
  <break>
  </break>
  in PhD object q?
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 Just do it; you will see that it works. Just use q.nadv to reference q's field nadv.
</p>
<p>
 Any method in class PhD can reference private fields and methods of any object of class PhD.
 <break>
 </break>
 <break>
 </break>
 <b>
  9. May I use fields in PhDTest to reduce the number of declarations needed in methods in this class?
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 No, don’t do that, for at least three reasons.
</p>
<list style="ordered">
 <li>
  <p>
   You don’t know enough about JUnit testing to do this right.
   <break>
   </break>
   For example, you don’t know the order in which methods are called.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Such fields often create interactions between testing procedures, but those testing
   <break>
   </break>
   procedures should be completely independent of each other.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   A declaration may be far from its use, making it more difficult to understand the methods.
  </p>
 </li>
</list>
<p>
 Remember, once you write a declaration-assignment, you can easily copy-and-paste it into another method.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  10. How can I write this in Java? "this PhD and PhD p are different"?
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 Keyword
 <b>
  this
 </b>
 is a pointer to the object in which it appears. You will learn this soon. So you can write this expression as
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  this
 </b>
 != p

  The instruction says "With package a1 selected in the Package Explorer pane, create a new class, PhD. It should be placed in package a1. It should not have method main. The created class should have package a1; on the first line."
 </p>
 <p>
  But according to above, we should not have package a1, and should put PhD in default package?

   Sorry. We have fixed it above. Both files belong in package a1.
