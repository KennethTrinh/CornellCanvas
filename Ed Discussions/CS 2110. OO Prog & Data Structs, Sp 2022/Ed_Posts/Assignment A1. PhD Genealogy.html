  <bold>
   5. Should we check for situations like a PhD is their own PhD or someone got their PhD in a year that is &lt; 0
  </bold>
  ? See answer below.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <bold>
   6. Can we add other methods to class PhD
  </bold>
  ? Do not add other methods. There is no need for them.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <bold>
   7. If I want to call constructor 1 from constructor 2, I can't put assert statements at the beginning of constructor 2. What do I do?
  </bold>
  See answer below.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <bold>
   8. Suppose my field for the number of advisees is nadv. Since nadv is private, from PhD object p (say), how can I reference/change nadv in PhD object q?
  </bold>
  See answer below.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <bold>
   9. May I use fields in PhDTest to reduce the number of declarations needed in methods in this class?
  </bold>
  See answer below.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <bold>
   10. How can I write this in Java? "this PhD and PhD p  are different"?
  </bold>
  See answer below.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <bold>
   11. What do I do if I get the error "The method assertThrows(Class&lt;AssertionError&gt;, () -&gt; {}) is undefined for the type PhDTest." ?
  </bold>
  Press the mouse over the red x to the left. A small window should pop up, and one option in it is to import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertThrows; Select it so that it is imported.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <bold>
   12. Do I need specifications of JUnit testing procedures? Do I have to put comments in them?
  </bold>
  No. The important thing is to make the name of the testing procedure indicate what is being tested.

   ANSWERS
  </bold>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <bold>
   0. Can you suggest a schedule for doing A1?
  </bold>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Wed, 2 Feb. Read through the A1 handout. Read pages 1..2 carefully, scan the rest.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thu-Fri, 3-4 Feb. Do step 1 at the bottom of page 2: Create the project and class PhD.
  <break>
  </break>
  Do step 2 page 3: Put in declarations of the fields.
  <break>
  </break>
  Do step 3 on page 4. Create the JUnit testing class.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Sat-Sun, 5-6 Feb. Write and test the methods of Group A.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Mon, 8 Feb. Write and test the methods of Group B and C.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Wed, 9 Feb. Write and test the methods of Group D and put in some tests for assert statements.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thu, 10 Feb. Carefully go over points 6..8 on pages 7..8. Submit, a day before the due date.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <bold>
   <bold>
    1. When I create a JUnit testing class and then put in an assertEquals or assertThrows statement, I get an error.
   </bold>
  </bold>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Press your mouse over the red x before a line with an assertEquals or assertThrows call that shows an error. A window will pop up suggesting the need for an import statement. Select that and let Eclipse put in the import statement.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <bold>
   2. Should I put files in the default package? No.
  </bold>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  We want both PhD.java and PhDTest.java to be in package a1.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <bold>
   3. How many times can I submit on the CMS
  </bold>
  ? Submit as often as you like. Only the last one is graded.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  BUT DO NOT take this as an opportunity to submit every 3 minutes, submitting 15-20 times.
  <break>
  </break>
  Submit when you know it is done, but if later you see how to do something better, submit again.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <bold>
   4. I get a warning about my method specification because I am not using @param or @return
  </bold>
  .
  <bold>
   What do I do?
  </bold>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Ignore the warnings and delete those @param things for now. We don't need them.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Read about method specifications in our Style Guidelines: Visit JavaHyperText page and click "Style Guide" in the left part of the top navigation bar.

  <bold>
   5. Should we check for situations like a PhD is their own advisor or someone got their PhD in a year that is &lt; 0
  </bold>
  ?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  No. Please implement the spec of each method exactly; do nothing more, nothing less.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  We are not attempting to create a completely realistic class to be used in a real life situation.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  We are attempting to teach you about OO in Java with a minimum amount of your time.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <break>
  </break>
  <bold>
   6. Can we add other methods to class PhD
  </bold>
  ? Do not add other methods. There is no need for them.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <break>
  </break>
  <bold>
   7. If I want to call constructor 1 from constructor 2, I can't put assert statements at the beginning of constructor 2. What do I do?
  </bold>
  <break>
  </break>
  If you are not contemplating calling one constructor from another, which hasn't been taught as of this writing, no need to read further.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  But the answer to this question appears in note #11.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <break>
  </break>
  <bold>
   8. Suppose my field for the number of advisees is nadv. Since nadv is private,
   <break>
   </break>
   from PhD object p (say), how can I reference/change nadv, the number of advisees
   <break>
   </break>
   in PhD object q?
  </bold>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Just do it; you will see that it works. Just use q.nadv to reference q's field nadv.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Any method in class PhD can reference private fields and methods of any object of class PhD.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  <bold>
   9. May I use fields in PhDTest to reduce the number of declarations needed in methods in this class?
  </bold>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  No, don’t do that, for at least three reasons.
 </paragraph>
 <list style="ordered">
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    You don’t know enough about JUnit testing to do this right.
    <break>
    </break>
    For example, you don’t know the order in which methods are called.
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    Such fields often create interactions between testing procedures, but those testing
    <break>
    </break>
    procedures should be completely independent of each other.
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    A declaration may be far from its use, making it more difficult to understand the methods.
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
 </list>
 <paragraph>
  Remember, once you write a declaration-assignment, you can easily copy-and-paste it into another method.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <bold>
   10. How can I write this in Java? "this PhD and PhD p are different"?
  </bold>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Keyword
  <bold>
   this
  </bold>
  is a pointer to the object in which it appears. You will learn this soon. So you can write this expression as
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <bold>
   this
  </bold>
  != p

  The instruction says "With package a1 selected in the Package Explorer pane, create a new class, PhD. It should be placed in package a1. It should not have method main. The created class should have package a1; on the first line."
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  But according to above, we should not have package a1, and should put PhD in default package?

  Sorry. We have fixed it above. Both files belong in package a1.
