 Because neighbors( ) is a collection with each object containing the id and the distance to orb. How should I go about identifying the NodeStatus object with the minimum distance?

  Well, if I give you a list (or set) of numbers and ask you which is the smallest, what do you do?
 </p>
 <p>
  Do you write a loop?
 </p>
 <p>
  There is a shortcut here. Look at class NodeStatus. YOu'll see that it implements Comparable&lt;NodeStatus&gt;.
 </p>
 <p>
  This makes it easy to sort the collection.
