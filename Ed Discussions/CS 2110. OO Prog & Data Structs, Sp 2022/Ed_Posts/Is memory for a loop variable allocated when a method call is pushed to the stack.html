 In lecture, we were told that memory for all local variables and parameters in a method is allocated when the call is pushed to the stack. Loop variables can be declared multiple times in a method. Ex.
</p>
<p>
 for (int i=0, i&lt;10; i++) {};
</p>
<p>
 for (int i=5, i&lt;10; i++) {};
</p>
<p>
 Does not result in any errors. Does this mean that memory is allocated only for the first declaration of the variable, and future declarations are ignored?

  The two i's in the loops are totally different variables.
  <break>
  </break>
  Each is allocated space in the frame for the call when that frame is pushed onto the stack.
 </p>
 <p>
  That is what you should remember.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the compiler can be smart enough to use the same memory location for both variables since their scopes don't intersect. Even compilers we wrote in the 1960s (for a different language, Algol 60) could do that.
 </p>

  When you say "future declarations are ignored" what do you mean? Be careful with words. At compile-time, each declaration-assignment is checked for syntactic correctness. At compile-time, space for must be allocated for each declared local variable in the frame for a call. At runtime, absolutely nothing has to be done for the declaration of a local variable.
