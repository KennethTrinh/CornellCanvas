  We cannot figure out how to get the distance to the node f, since the Info field is private and the priorities in the Heap are protected, and polling from the heap just returns to node, which doesn't have a "value" or "dist".

  In the LinkedList assignment you had an inner class with private fields, which you could reference from the outer class.

  I think somehow my indentation and brackets got messed up so the info class was declared on the same level as the path class, so when I was trying to use stuff from info, it said "______ not visible", so I assumed I couldn't access anything from it, so I was very confused haha. But I think I fixed it now.
