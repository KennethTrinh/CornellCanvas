  As post #664 mentions, we should test DLList with multiple data types.  An error comes up when I try using an int, but Integer works.  Does this mean that DLList will only work with Wrapper classes because of the "&lt;E&gt;" in the class declaration?  I'm guessing this is the case but would really appreciate some confirmation.  (I have tried finding the relevant info in the lecture slides but failed)

  Generics donâ€™t work with primitives. They work with objects, not just wrapper classes.
