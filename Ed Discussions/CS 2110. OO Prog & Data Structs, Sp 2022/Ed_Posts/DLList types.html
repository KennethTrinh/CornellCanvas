 As post #664 mentions, we should test DLList with multiple data types.  An error comes up when I try using an int, but Integer works.  Does this mean that DLList will only work with Wrapper classes because of the "&lt;E&gt;" in the class declaration?  I'm guessing this is the case but would really appreciate some confirmation.  (I have tried finding the relevant info in the lecture slides but failed)

 Thanks!!

  Generics donâ€™t work with primitives. They work with objects, not just wrapper classes.
