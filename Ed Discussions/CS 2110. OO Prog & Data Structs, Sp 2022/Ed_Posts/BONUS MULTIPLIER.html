 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 I have done several tests on my find phase, and noticed that I'm getting varying bonuses. Sometimes its around 1.28 and other times could be as low as 1.17. Why could this be happening?
</p>
<p>
 Also, does adding code for the flee method reduce the optimisation or affect the multiplier in the find phase? I understand that it only occurs after the find phase, but does it have any effect on find?
</p>
<p>
 Thank you.

  The bonus depends on how "long" (steps) the find phase takes. From page 2 of the handout:

   score bonus multiplier for finding the Orb in fewer steps.

 </p>
 <p>
  Next time you run the program, look at the data panel. It shows Gold, Bonus (multiplier), and Score. The score is the product of Gold and Bonus.

  Sorry this isn't clear.
