 When working on A2, the auto formatting doesn't seem to be working when I save the file, even though it worked for A1. I also checked my preferences for auto formatting and they match the ones in the guide on HyperText. Is there something else that I need to do?

  Can you show a screenshot of your package explorer with the src folder and default package expanded

   I realized it was because I didn't properly create the class - sorry about that!
