 In the spec for TODO15, it says that the text of the dialogue should just be the exception's message.
</p>
<p>
 However, in the A6 handout, the class of the exception is shown in the text field as well.
</p>
<p>
 Which one should we follow?

  The spec in TODO 15 is what we intended.  The picture in the handout is wrong.  So, we'll accept it either way, but we'd prefer the class be only in the title of the window.
