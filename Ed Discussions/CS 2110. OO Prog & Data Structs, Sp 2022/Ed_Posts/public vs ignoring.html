 I know with fields if I don't put the word public it's package only access, but if I do put public anything can access it, is that the same thing when it comes to methods? (including the constructor)? So in A1 if I didn't put the word public before the constructor would I lose points?

  On page 4 of the writeup, it says: "Make all the methods public." Please make your constructors public.

     Yes, it is the same. (You will need to import the class when trying to use it (and access methods and fields) in another package.)
