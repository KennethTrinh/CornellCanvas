  Hi, I attempted to download Java and this is as far as I got but I can't seem to open the files nor do I know which ones to open. Is this what it's supposed to look like?

  Did you download one of the pkg files? If you run the pkg file and follow the instructions then you should be fine. Double check by running
  <bold>
   javac -version
  </bold>
  and
  <bold>
   java -version
  </bold>
  in terminal afterwards.

  No, I didn't download the pkg file because it only had the option of the large heap and not normal heap, and the canvas instructions said that we should choose the normal one. But should I go ahead and download the pkg file from the large heap anyways?

  If you go here:
  <link href="https://developer.ibm.com/languages/java/semeru-runtimes/downloads"/>
  https://developer.ibm.com/languages/java/semeru-runtimes/downloads, and then select Java 11 (LTS), operating system macOS and x64, you should be able to download the pkg or tar.gz files.
