 When upcasting or downcasting, do you have to use a new variable or can you use the same one?

  You can use the same one but you can only refer to the methods you defined the static type to be, which is why we usually use a new variable, so we can change the static type and use the methods of the downcast we are using. This means we do not violate the compile time reference rule and do not get an error.
