  Hello! I am not sure I understand why is string(k) rejected by the compiler and (Integer) ob is not. I thought that if the object does not have a partition of that type then the casting cannot happen?

  I made this question public (and made you anonymous). Please don't make questions private; others may have the same questions.

  This is important: At compile-time, absolutely nothing is known about what pointer will be in a variable at runtime, and probably that runtime value will change from pointing from one object to another as execution proceeds. Therefore, at compiletime, only the TYPES of expressions are used.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Consider  (String) k.
  <break>
  </break>
  At compile time, look at it as   (String) (an expression of type Integer)
  <break>
  </break>
  It is known at compiletime that an Integer object cannot have a String partition. Therefore, it is a compiletime error
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Consider  (Integer) ob.
  <break>
  </break>
  At compiletime, look at it as  (Integer)(an expression of type Object)
  <break>
  </break>
  At runtime, that (expression of type Object) COULD contain a pointer to an object that has an Integer expression!
  <break>
  </break>
  Therefore, that cast is allowed.
  <break>
  </break>
  At runtime, if ob points at an Integer object, fine. But if it points at any other object, A ClassCastException is thrown.

  Does this help?

  That makes sense! So if it was (integer) k where k is say a string object, java won't allow it but since in (integer) ob casting, ob is an object type which can be casted down to any other type, it allows it?
