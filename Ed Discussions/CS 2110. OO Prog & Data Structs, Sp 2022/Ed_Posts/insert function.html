  For insert, are we supposed to just add to the set of children? is that all we have to do (while also making sure that the conditions are satisfied)?

  Yes, you just make a new CovidTree object with c as the root and add that object to p's set of children, and then return the new object you made.

  Thank you so much! Okay, so the way to think about the set, is a set of trees where each tree has a root that is the

   parent

  of some other child (which also has a tree) and so on? Im not sure if that makes sense

  Yes, each child is also a CovidTree with a human as the root. The child also has a set of its own children but that set of children could be empty or it could have more trees and so on...
