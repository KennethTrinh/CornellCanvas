  This line of code is used rather than the get class typically used. Java hypertext mentioned that if a class is subclassed using getclass should be prefered over instanceof. Is there are reason why instanceof is used in this case, and would points be deducted if getclass is used instead.

  Stick with the use of getClass. This exam was given when instanceof was taught in the class as the way to check the types in equals()

  Please read about method equals in JavaHperText.

 <paragraph>
  Whether one uses instanceof or getClass depends on the method specification.

  I just read it. On the exam would it be safer to always use getClass() since instanceOf() can run into problems?

  Definitely. In fact for the equals method we would be expecting you to use getClass(), and you would lose points for using instanceOf.
