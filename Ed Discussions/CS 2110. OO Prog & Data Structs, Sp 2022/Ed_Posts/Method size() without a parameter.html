 Hi there, we are working on method size(). We completely understand how to complete the recursion IF we were to pass an argument to the function (like the example leaves(ch) from the videos). However, since size() does not take any arguments, how should we go about this? If you have any feedback, please let us know!

  You can call the method size on the children, assume you have a child ch then you can do ch.size()
