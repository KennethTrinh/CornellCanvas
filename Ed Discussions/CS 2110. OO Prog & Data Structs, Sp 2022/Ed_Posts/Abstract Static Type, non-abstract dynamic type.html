 Are we allowed to declare an object like:
</p>
<p>
 Abstract-Class obj1 = Implementation-Class obj2? As an example,
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Shape
 </b>
 Triangle =
 <b>
  Triangle
 </b>
 t1;
</p>
<p>
 Where
 <b>
  Triangle
 </b>
 is an implementation of abstract class
 <b>
  Shape
 </b>
 .
</p>
<p>
 If so, why is this allowed? Is it because the dynamic type of the variable Triangle will always be
 <b>
  Triangle
 </b>
 rather than
 <b>
  Shape
 </b>
 ?
</p>

  the dynamic type of Triangle will be Triangle which is an extends the Abstract class Shape (subclass) so you are allowed to do that, also to initialize the variable Triangle you can just do
  <break>
  </break>
  Triangle t1 = new Triangle(…);
  <break>
  </break>
  Shape Triangle = t1;
  <break>
  </break>
  However this limits you do only perform methods from the class Shape when using the variable Triangle, so if the class triangle has new methods that aren’t in class Shape you can’t do Triangle.mm(); assuming mm is a method in class triangle and not shape. This would violate the compile time reference rule
