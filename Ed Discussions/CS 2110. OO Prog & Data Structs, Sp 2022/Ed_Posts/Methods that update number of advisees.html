  Page 6, number 7 on the specification document says that there should be three methods that update the number of advisees. Does the second PhD constructor count as a method?

 <paragraph>
  I'm guessing yes, because JavaHyperText describes procedures as a type of method.

  Yes a constructor is one of the three types of methods, which are procedures, constructors, and functions.
