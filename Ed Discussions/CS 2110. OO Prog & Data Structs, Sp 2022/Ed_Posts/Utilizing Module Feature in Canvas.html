 This course has a lot of work, material, and web pages to keep track of. In most of my other courses, the
 <b>
  modules
 </b>
 feature is utilized where work is broken down by week or by material type( quizzes, lecture material, recitation, etc.).
</p>
<p>
 I was wondering if this feature could be considered this semester or in the future? I think that this can prevent problems like students missing quizzes completely and reduce stress for students.

  We'll look into this. Thanks for the comment.

  The 3-week schedule, emphasized since the beginning of the course, was supposed to solve these problems.
