 Confused on how to call this method in the testing file because it has two arguments (for the parent and child nodes):
</p>
<p>
 this was the example given to us: A.CovidRouteTo(E) returns the list [A,C,E].
</p>
<p>
 I tried calling it like this in the test which is clearly wrong: var route1= st.humanA.CovidRouteTo(
 <i>
  humanB
 </i>
 );
</p>
<p>
 Where would humanA argument go?
</p>

  humanA is st.humanA.
 </p>
 <p>
  Method covidRouteTo is in a node. It's looking for the covid route from that node to the argument.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here's the specification:
 </p>
 <p>
  /** Return the route Covid took to get from "here" (the root of &lt;br&gt;
  <break>
  </break>
  * this CovidTree) to descendent c. If there is no such route, return null.&lt;br&gt;
 </p>
