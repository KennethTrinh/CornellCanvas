  Confused on how to call this method in the testing file because it has two arguments (for the parent and child nodes):
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  this was the example given to us: A.CovidRouteTo(E) returns the list [A,C,E].
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I tried calling it like this in the test which is clearly wrong: var route1= st.humanA.CovidRouteTo(
  <italic>
   humanB
  </italic>
  );
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Where would humanA argument go?

  humanA is st.humanA.

  Method covidRouteTo is in a node. It's looking for the covid route from that node to the argument.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Here's the specification:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  /** Return the route Covid took to get from "here" (the root of &lt;br&gt;
  <break>
  </break>
  * this CovidTree) to descendent c. If there is no such route, return null.&lt;br&gt;
