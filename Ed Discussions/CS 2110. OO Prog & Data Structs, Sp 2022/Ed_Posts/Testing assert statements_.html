  Hello, Iâ€™m having difficulty with the JUnit testing of assert statements. The assert statements are on and I used the same format as shown in the recitation
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  assertThrows(AssertionError.class, () -&gt; t1.equals(null));
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  But when I run the JUnit none of my assert statements are executed (they are all highlighted in yellow) I am using test cases that are supposed to throw an assertion error but nothing is changing.

  Did you make sure to instantiate an object of PhD such that you can do PhD.method() with the anonymous function ?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Also this is a better question for consulting/office hours

  What is t1? Which assert statement are you trying to test?

  That is the example in the recitation.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  To test the assertion on the constructors, I used:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <italic>
   assertThrows
  </italic>
  (AssertionError.
  <bold>
   class
  </bold>
  , () -&gt; {
  <bold>
   new
  </bold>
  PhD("", 1920, 0); });
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  To test the methods, I first initialized a few different PhD objects and used:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <italic>
   assertThrows
  </italic>
  (AssertionError.
  <bold>
   class
  </bold>
  , () -&gt; t1.addAdvisor2(a1));

  -- I recommend testing for each precondition for the constructor on its own, not both in one case for purposes of structural reinforcement of your code
