  If I implemented a method based on the intention of counting but it's logically searching. Will there be deductions?

  If you said the wrong thing (counting or searching) points will be deducted.

  Your method should be either counting or searching. In terms of deductions, if your method is correct and fulfills the test cases in the grading program, then you get the points for that method (for correctness).

  FORGET ABOUT INTENTION. DO not look at the return type and the value returned. Just ask yourself: Is this method going to count the number of nodes with a certain property or is it going to stop once it find a node with a certain property.
