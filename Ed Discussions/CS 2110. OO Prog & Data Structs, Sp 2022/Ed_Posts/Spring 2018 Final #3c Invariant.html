<p>
 Could anyone explain how this invariant could be constructed? I would appreciate the explanation and/or answers to more specific questions below:
</p>
<p>
 1. How do dividing up c and introducing variable i in the invariant satisfy the postcondition for c that does not exist?
</p>
<p>
 2. Could we have chosen either x1 or x2 and y1 or y2 to have the combined sorted section in b[h...u-1] of the invariant?
