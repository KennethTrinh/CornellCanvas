 <paragraph>
  Could anyone explain how this invariant could be constructed? I would appreciate the explanation and/or answers to more specific questions below:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1. How do dividing up c and introducing variable i in the invariant satisfy the postcondition for c that does not exist?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. Could we have chosen either x1 or x2 and y1 or y2 to have the combined sorted section in b[h...u-1] of the invariant?
