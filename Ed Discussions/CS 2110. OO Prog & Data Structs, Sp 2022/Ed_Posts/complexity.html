  log(n) is how we describe time that is exponentially decreasing with respect to n
 </p>
 <p>
  For example if we have the loop: for(int i = 0, i &lt; n, i++){...} then clearly this loop is going to run n times and the complexity is O(n)
 </p>
 <p>
  But what if we have for(int i = 1, i &lt;=n, i = 2*i){...} This is not constant time since the number of loops depends on n in some way but notice that if n is 100 then this loop is executed only 7 times (i=1,2,4,8,16,32,64) which is way less than 100. So clearly this runtime is between O(n) and O(1) and as n increases the fewer and fewer extra loops occur (meaning as n increases the runtime increases more and more slowly). These traits are representative of the log function (look at the graph attached - red is O(n) and blue is O(log n)).
