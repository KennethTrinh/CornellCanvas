  From Java Hypertext: 'Z' +1 - 'A' evaluates to 26
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>

 <paragraph>
  Why is this true? Shouldn't it be 27 if there are 26 letters in the alphabet...

  'A' is considered at the 0th index of an array if we made an array of all the alphabet, 'Z' is considered at the 25th index of an array if we made an array of the alphabet. 25-0+1 = 26, maybe this helps

  Consider the Follower minus First rule. The same thing applies here. We're calculating the number of values in the range 'A'..'Z' using the Follower minus First rule
