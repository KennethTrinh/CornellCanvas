 According to the instructions pdf, it says 9 test cases are needed, but if I was only able to come up with say seven, how badly will it affect my grading?

  Please don't concern yourself with the number of test cases. Instead, ask yourself if you've tested the method thoroughly, using the testing techniques you were taught in both lecture and recitation.
