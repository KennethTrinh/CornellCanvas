  Do we have to write java docs for tester methods? Also, do we have to write comments for each test case?

  No you do not have to write javadoc comments for test methods. As long as you name the testing procedures something that makes it clear what you are testing, that's fine. You also don't need to write comments for each test case, but for some tests for the more complicated methods, this can help you figure out what you still need to test and help us grade your test cases.
