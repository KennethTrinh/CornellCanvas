 I've attempted this problem but I'm not really understanding the answer key. Would someone mind explaining why x --&gt; 10x would work?
</p>
<p>
 Also, I understand that if the load factor is &gt; 0.75, then putting the elements of the set into a new array and re-hashing is necessary but how do you know the exact size of the new rehashed array? I also don't really understand why the new hash table looks like what is presented in the answer key.

  a) x-&gt;10x works because the hash table has a fixed size 10. Because 10(1) mod 10 = 0, 10(3) mod 10 = 0, 10(7) mod 10 = 0, and 10(9) mod 10 = 0, every insertion results in a collision.
 </p>
 <p>
  b) The size of the new rehashed array is twice the old array. For how to rehash, see #2356
