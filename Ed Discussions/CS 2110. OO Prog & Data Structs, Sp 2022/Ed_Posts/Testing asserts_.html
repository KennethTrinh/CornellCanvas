  Lets say that we want to run a test where the assert statement does not throw an assertionError, how would we write that with asserthrows()? Or do we only write test cases for when the assert statment's boolean expression evaluates to false?

  When testing assert statements you only want to make sure they throw an error otherwise there’s no point of testing them (that should be covered in your earlier test cases, valid parameters shouldn’t throw an error)

  If you want to test a case the the test should not throw an AssertionError, that's just a normal test where the method should be tested that it does what it's supposed to.
