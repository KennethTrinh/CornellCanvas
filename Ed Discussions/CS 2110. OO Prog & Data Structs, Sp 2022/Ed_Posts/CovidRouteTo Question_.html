  In the comments of CovidRouteTo it says " If c is null, there is no route to it, so null should be returned. But do NOT put in a special test for this case; it is unnecessary case analysis."  Does this mean we shouldn't include a test case in the test file to check when c is null or we shouldn't provide code for this situation in the method itself?

  You definitely should have a test case in the JUnit testing class for it.

  The comment says don't put a special if-test for it in method CovidRouteTo.
