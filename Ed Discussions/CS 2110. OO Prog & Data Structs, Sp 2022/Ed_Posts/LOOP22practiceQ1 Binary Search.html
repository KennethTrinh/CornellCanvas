  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I'm looking at this document: https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/JavaAndDS/loops/22practiceQ1.pdf
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Can you explain why it's h=0 and the first initialization and h=-1 in the second? The situations seem identical to me, and if you're just trying to make the segment from 0 to h empty in both situations, how come you use b[0..h-1] must be empty in the initial example but b[0..h] must be empty in the binary search example?
 </paragraph>

  Thanks!

  The first example has h to the right of the line, the second example has h to the left of the line, the side of the line it's on is very important.
