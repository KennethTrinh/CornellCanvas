 Would super.method() only be useful when there are 2 methods with the same name in both the super and sub classes?
</p>
<p>
 If you are simply trying to access a uniquely named function in the superclass, can't you simply call a function without super and by the inside out rule, the function in the superclass would automatically be called?

  super.method() would be
  <b>
   absolutely necessary
  </b>
  when you are overriding a method from the parent class and want to call the parent class's version of that method. Not putting the super. would make the method recursive.
 </p>
 <p>
  Other methods that are not overridden are
  <b>
   inherited
  </b>
  , that is, they exist in the subclass automatically, so you would not use super.
