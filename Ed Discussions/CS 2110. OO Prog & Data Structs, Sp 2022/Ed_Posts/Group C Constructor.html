  Hello, I was confused by the instructions given in group C. Do you create a new constructor in class PhD or do we replace the original constructor from group A? If we have to make a new constructor do we need to rewrite the original methods?

  You make a new constructor with additional parameters to differentiate from the Group A constructor.

  What do you mean rewrite the original methods, it’s in the same class you don’t need to rewrite new ones

  You should create a new constructor. The only methods you should create with each group are the ones listed in said group. So you don't need to rewrite anything you already wrote and tested for previous groups
