  I'm having trouble figuring out how to repeat the char value a certain amount of times. I'm guessing that we can't use repeat() since it's not in the API, but I can't find another method that would repeat the char.

  Make sure youâ€™re looking at the documentation for String for Java 11. If you're looking at docs for like Java 7, then it's not going to be on there.
