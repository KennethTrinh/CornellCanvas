 Hi, I don't know why my insert method is wrong and it's messing up all my test cases. I know my depth method is right because I showed it to Professor Gries but it won't pass any test cases because the insert method doesn't work right. I created a new covidtree using c as the node and put that into a variable, added that variable to the children set of the object, and then returned that variable.
