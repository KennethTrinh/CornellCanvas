 When I check the human at the root in the tree in the depth() method, should I use the method human(), or the field human, or does it not make a difference?

  Doesn't make a difference. Try it yourself, you will see the results are the same.

   It is best here to use the field, but both can be used.

    Just out of curiosity, why is it better to use the field here?

     Accessing a field doesn't add anything to the call stack but rather accesses the field in the object folder, calling the method would have to push the method call onto the call stack execute and return the same field and then push it off the call stack, much simpler by referencing the field.
