 When I was going through the website on Canvas under the GUIs lecture, I encountered a few problems that confused me.
</p>
<p>
 1, What is the difference between Pane, Panel, and Frame?
</p>
<p>
 2, Do we need to know all of the LayoutManager for the panel?
</p>
<p>
 3, What is the difference between PropertyChangeListener and ChangeListener?
</p>
<p>
 Also, can we have more information about how we'll be tested on the prelim about the GUIs? Is it going to be like the questions in fall 2016 that just ask us to draw the GUIs based on the codes, Or is it going to be in other forms?
</p>

  Fall 2016 is 6 years old.  I would not rely on anything in that as being definitively representative of the course as it is today.  Actually I wouldn't even bother looking at any exam more than 3 semesters old TBH.

  For what you do need to know, please refer to the study guide for this semester in Canvas.
