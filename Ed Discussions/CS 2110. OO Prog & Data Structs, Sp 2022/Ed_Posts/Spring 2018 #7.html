  Would someone be able to explain how these values were found?

  This is the same as the Dijkstra algorithm you implemented in A7.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Iteration 1: a -&gt; b is 9
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Iteration 2: d is what you poll from F, so loop through its neighbors. We find a smaller d[b] now: a -&gt; d -&gt; b, so 8
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Iteration 3: e is what you poll from F. (not important because not a neighbor of b, so it is still 8)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Iteration 4: c is what you poll from F, so loop through its neighbors. We find a smaller d[b] now: a -&gt; e -&gt; c -&gt; b, so 7

  why would you poll e instead of f for iteration 3? Since the path to f from a settled node is 3, while the the path to e is 5, wouldn't you go to f then e?

  Think about the algorithm you implemented. The value associated with each node in your F heap is d[f] = 7, since the value is the distance from a to f. d[e] is 5, so it should be added to the settled set.
