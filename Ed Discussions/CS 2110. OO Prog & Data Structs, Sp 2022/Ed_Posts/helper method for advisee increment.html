 Hi, and I apologize in advance if this is not an allowed question, but is it ok to install a helper method to increase the advisees of a PhD object that gets called in other methods or is there a different way we are supposed to update the advisees of a PhD? Thank you so much, and have a nice day!

  Adding on here, remember that private fields can be accessed on the class level, not just the instance level. So as long as weâ€™re in the same class, we can access private fields directly for any instance.

   No, you do not need to add ANY methods.
  </p>
  <p>
   Just write an assignment statement to increment the number of advisees.
  </p>
  <p>
   Go ahead, just try it.
