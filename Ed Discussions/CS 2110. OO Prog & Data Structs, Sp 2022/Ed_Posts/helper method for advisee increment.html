  Hi, and I apologize in advance if this is not an allowed question, but is it ok to install a helper method to increase the advisees of a PhD object that gets called in other methods or is there a different way we are supposed to update the advisees of a PhD? Thank you so much, and have a nice day!

  No, you do not need to add ANY methods.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Just write an assignment statement to increment the number of advisees.

 <paragraph>
  Go ahead, just try it.

  I'm making your question public. Others might have the same question.

  Adding on here, remember that private fields can be accessed on the class level, not just the instance level. So as long as weâ€™re in the same class, we can access private fields directly for any instance.
