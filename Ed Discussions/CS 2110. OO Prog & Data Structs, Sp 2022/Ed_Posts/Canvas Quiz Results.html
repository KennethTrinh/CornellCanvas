 Can you view the results of an attempt on a Canvas Quiz while you still have attempts remaining to see which exact answers you got wrong? I have taken the first three quizzes already and I was under the assumption that you were not able to see which questions you got wrong until you had no more attempts remaining. Is that correct, or are you supposed to see the answers to the questions you got wrong before the next attempt?

 Thank you
