  In the demo video for the completed A6, whenever you save the score, it shows up instantaneously on the scores file.

  However, my saved scores only show up when I open the file after I save it using the "Save score" menu item.

  Is this okay?

  My editor (BBEdit) monitors the file and updates in real-time if it changes on disk.  Probably yours does not.  That is okay.
