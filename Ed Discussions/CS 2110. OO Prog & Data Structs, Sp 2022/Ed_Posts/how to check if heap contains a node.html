  I'm struggling to write "if (w is not in S or F)," I can't find any heap methods that check if they contain a node? do we have to check all of the nodes manually before this line?

  Think of it like this, if itâ€™s not in SandF then it must be null in that hashmap right, do you have hashmap like that?

  thanks - i did create a hashmap but haven't figured out how to actually put an entry for each node of S and F into it, especially since S starts out empty and F only has v in it. do you have any advice?
