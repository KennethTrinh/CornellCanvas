 I don't get how the question (iii) is executed. Is ((A) (new B(3))).m( ) using the method m() in B?

  Yes, the m() in class B is being used because of the bottom-up rule (when looking for a method in an object that is appropriate for a method call, start from the bottom of an object and look upward). Though the object is cast up to class A, it still contains a partition for B in its object folder so it can use class B's methods. For more information about inheritance, see lecture 5.
