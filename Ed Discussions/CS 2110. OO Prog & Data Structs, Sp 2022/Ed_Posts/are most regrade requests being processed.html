  Hi, I’m just quite worried since I saw the post said most requests have been processed. I requested on 23rd but there’s no reply yet. Would there be any chance that it’s overlooked by the grader?

  We work through most of them each day. I believe the regrade you’re referring to is taking longer than usual because it involves us finding the physical copy of your exam to resolve it. That might explain the delay.
