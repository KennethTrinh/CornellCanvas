 Is the purpose of this method to multiply the root with all of its children, including the leaf? E.g. if the tree consists of root-child-child-leaf, we multiply root*child*child*leaf? Or is it root*leaf?
</p>
<p>
 I’m confused what the question is asking for when it says “One can multiply together the values of a root-to-leaf path; return the largest such product.”

  Suppose one root-to-leaf path has these values: 3, 5, 2. The product is 3*5*2 = 30.
 </p>
 <p>
  Suppose another root-to-leaf path has these values: 1, 5. The product is 1*5 = 6.

   Ok! I'm still confused on how exactly the recursive part of this method works. When maxPathProduct(child) is called, I understand that the current child becomes the "new root", and we look at the children of it.
  </p>
  <p>
   <break>
   </break>
   Root {node 0}
  </p>
  <p>
   |
   <break>
   </break>
   Level 1 children {nodes 1,2}
  </p>
  <p>
   |
   <break>
   </break>
   Level 2 children{children of 1, children of 2}
  </p>
  <p>
   <break>
   </break>
   Say the method goes down the route of 0-&gt;1-&gt;children of 1 to find the product. How does the method go back and check 0-&gt;2-&gt;children of 2?
  </p>
