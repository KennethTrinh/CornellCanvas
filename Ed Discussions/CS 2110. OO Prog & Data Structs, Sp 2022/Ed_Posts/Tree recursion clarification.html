  Is the purpose of this method to multiply the root with all of its children, including the leaf? E.g. if the tree consists of root-child-child-leaf, we multiply root*child*child*leaf? Or is it root*leaf?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I’m confused what the question is asking for when it says “One can multiply together the values of a root-to-leaf path; return the largest such product.”

  Suppose one root-to-leaf path has these values: 3, 5, 2. The product is 3*5*2 = 30.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Suppose another root-to-leaf path has these values: 1, 5. The product is 1*5 = 6.

  Ok! I'm still confused on how exactly the recursive part of this method works. When maxPathProduct(child) is called, I understand that the current child becomes the "new root", and we look at the children of it.

  <break>
  </break>
  Root {node 0}
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  |
  <break>
  </break>
  Level 1 children {nodes 1,2}
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  |
  <break>
  </break>
  Level 2 children{children of 1, children of 2}
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <break>
  </break>
  Say the method goes down the route of 0-&gt;1-&gt;children of 1 to find the product. How does the method go back and check 0-&gt;2-&gt;children of 2?
