  As with all such complicated loops, the invariant should be given.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  That is something we hope you do more and more as you program, because it helps you.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  But you can say,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  //invariant: as given in the abstract algorithm AND
  <break>
  </break>
  //.                 the def of the HashSet.
