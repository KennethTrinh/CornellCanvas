  Hello! I wanted to confirm that binary search does not have a worst-case i.e. the time complexity of binary search is always log(n)?

  Could you please look at the algorithm and determine for yourself, based on the algorithm, what its worst case time?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Then report back here what your answer is and why.

  If we just answer the question, you learn nothing.

  I thought that the worst case is going to be same as O(logn) because when we implement binary search we are always looking at a particular half of the array i.e. the element we are examing is midpoint of the array so no matter what position the unknown (say v is) each interaction removes half of the elements to examine thus log n time complexity?
