 "If class Dog extends class Animal, and variable Animal pet contains a pointer to a Dog object, then the statement Dog spike= pet; is legal."
</p>
<p>
 I'm having trouble understanding why this statement is false. I believe both pet and spike should be referring to matching classes (something about subclassing?). Could someone please explain?
</p>

  Please get on JavaHyperText and memorize the compile-time reference rule.

 <p>
  You should be able to answer such a question yourself, but you are not using the rules of Java that you have been taught.

  It does not good simply for us to answer yes or no. You learn nothing by that.

   This requires a downward cast from the type of pet (which is Animal) to Dog. Downward casts are not done automatically; An explicit cast is required

    So it doesn't matter that the pointer is already pointing to a Dog object, as long as the class of the pet object itself is Animal, then it isn't possible?

     Yes, look at the example in lecture Polymorphism II we do this with interest account being a dynamic type of Account at the time so trying to use it as an interest account would be illegal (EVEN though thereâ€™s a pointer to an IAccount object)
