 The specification states
</p>
<p>
 /*You have a problem of writing this loop efficiently. You can't use a foreach loop
</p>
<p>
 * on both lists simultaneously. The simplest thing to do is to use List's
</p>
<p>
 * function toArray and work with the array representations of the lists. */
</p>
<p>
 Do we have to worry about loop efficiency here? I have a working implementation with a nested for loop. Will I lose points if there is a more efficient algorithm?

  Atulya is right. By paying attention to this part of the spec I realized a nested loop wasn't necessary
 </p>
 <p>
  (2) the answer l1[i] is the largest i such that l1[0..i] = l2[0..i].

   My loop was a while loop that had 1 line in its repetend that just added 1 to the loop variable. It's always nice to implement things in a simple manner rather than not.

    Remove the nested loop. Keep things simple
