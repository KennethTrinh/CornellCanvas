 Are we able to use the Java until array package to complete A4 it appears that some of the features of this package would be very helpful in completing this assignment but I don’t know if they would simplify the append function too much.

  Adding onto that. You should NOT need the array package or really any other packages to complete this assignment.

   I don't fully understand the question.

   You shouldn't need anything sophisticated to write function append.
  </p>
  <p>
   Just be sure your handle two cases: Appending to an empty list and appending to a non-empty list.
