  Should we know Executing (or evaluating) method calls/Executing a try-statement for prelim 1? I was looking at the study guide and I was unsure. I know for HW 1 it said that we don't need to learn about those in the JavaHyperText.

  You should know how to execute method calls and try-catch statements. Try-catch statements are a major part of exception handling.
