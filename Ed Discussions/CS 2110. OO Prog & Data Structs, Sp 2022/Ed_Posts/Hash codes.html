  How do we think about questions like these? And how do we know what kind of hash code creates the max number of collisions? Why do the possibilities listed work?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  From my understanding, I know that x-&gt;c would create the max number of collisions because everything is mapped to one bucket. But I’m not sure how to create other functions that don’t involve just a constant.

  You want to find a function that leads to number mod array.length to all equal the same number, we know that x -&gt; 10x would all lead to collisions because 10x mod 10 = 0 for all integers x, therefore they'll all get mapped to the same hole.
