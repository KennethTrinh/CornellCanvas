 Hello!
</p>
<p>
 I was wondering if we are expected to be able to implement an algorithm like the dutch national flag sorting. I was trying to do so and was pretty confused with the swapping and it would really help knowing up to what level should I be able to implement it.

  Implementing the dutch national flag sorting is supposed to be made easier by the loop invariants because it allows you to organize the algorithm and break down the problem into smaller pieces. I would advise you to do a lot of the past prelims to gauge the level at which we expect you to know loop invariants. However, I would say a problem of this difficulty is still fair game for the prelim.
