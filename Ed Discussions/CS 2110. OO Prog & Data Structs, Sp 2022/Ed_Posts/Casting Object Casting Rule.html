 Object-casting rule: A pointer to an object can be cast to any class for which it has a partition, and to none other.
</p>
<p>
 Does this mean that an object cannot be downcasted to its subclass unless at compiletime it was declared as a subclass?
</p>
<p>
 ie. You can't downcast unless the variable previously pointed to the lower subclass you are trying downcast to

  You write:
 </p>
 <p>
  "Does this mean that an object cannot be downcasted to its subclass unless at compiletime it was declared as a subclass?"
 </p>
 <p>
  If it's not declared as a subclass, how can it be a subclass?
