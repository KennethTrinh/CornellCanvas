  In the sorting homework there was an example where they first checked the midpoint at 2. Why do they check it at 2 and not 1? My understanding is that the length of the list is 4 so (4+ -1)/2 is 1.5 which rounds down to 1 and not up to 5?

  Aah. It's array segment c[0..4]. Therefore, c.length, the length of the list, is 5.

  But read on.

  Note that our loop invariant puts the two boundaries markers outside the ? section, something like shown below. Here's a reason for this: It makes proving termination --making progress within the repetend-- easier to see.

  With this invariant, let b.length = 5, so initially k = -1 and t = 5.
  <break>
  </break>
  In this case, we calculate e = (t+k)/2 to get the middle value.
  <break>
  </break>
  That's e = (5 -1)/2 = 2.
