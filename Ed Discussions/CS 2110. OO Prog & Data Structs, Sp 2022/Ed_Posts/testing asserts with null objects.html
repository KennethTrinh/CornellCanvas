  it says that we have to test assert statements, and in some of them, we have to assert a PhD object isn't null, so to test this, it seems logical to create a null PhD object and then to call the method. but by our own preconditions on the constructor, can we even create a null PhD object?

  null is the lack of an object so it doesn't have a type. You can just use the keyword null. There should be no call on the constructor.

  I see. when I test the assert though, I get this error:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Unexpected exception type thrown ==&gt; expected: &lt;java.lang.AssertionError&gt; but was: &lt;java.lang.NullPointerException&gt;
 </paragraph>

  this happens when I do something like "PhD object = null;" and then try to call one of the methods that involves the assert statement "assert object != null". any suggestions as to why this doesn't return an assertion error but a null pointer one?

  If you are trying to call something on the variable with value null using the dot operator, this throws a NullPointerException. You should only test null arguments.
