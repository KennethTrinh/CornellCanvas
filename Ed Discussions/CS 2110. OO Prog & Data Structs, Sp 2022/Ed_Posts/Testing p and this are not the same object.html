<p>
 In the instructions, it said to  "When testing whether two PhDs are the same object, use ==
 <break>
 </break>
 <break>
 </break>
 or !=; do NOT use function equals.".  Can I use assertSame()?  Because I don't know to test whether the two PhD's are the same object by using == or != in my testing case
</p>

  You shouldn't use any assert methods like assertSame or assertEquals in your PhD class.
