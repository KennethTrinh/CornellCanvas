 I had a question about one of the example problems from the video about the 1st loopy question:
</p>
<p>
 2. Q: 0 &lt; n P: v = minimum of b[k..n] and 0 ≤ k ≤ n
</p>
<p>
 The answer was k=n, and v=b[n].
</p>
<p>
 I got the k=n part right, but instead of v=b[n], I said v=b[k], because we would be assigning k to n. Does this not work? Why does it need to be v=b[n]?
</p>

  If k = n, b[n] and b[k] are the same array element.

   That should work fine. On an exam, both would be accepted
