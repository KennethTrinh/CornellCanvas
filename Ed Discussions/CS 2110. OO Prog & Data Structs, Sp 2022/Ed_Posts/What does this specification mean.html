  In method commonAncestor, it says "You have a problem of writing this loop efficiently. You can't use a for each loop * on both lists simultaneously."
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Why can't we use a nested for each loop? Does this lack of efficiency mean that this would take more lines to write or it would have worse time complexity? Do we have to convert both lists to arrays? I didn't do that but I think my method works correctly.

  This was put under the General label, but I guess it was an A5 question.  I have relabeled it as such.

  Please do not use a nested loop. You can write a solution that runs in linear time. Converting to an array would making querying by index constant time, so yes, that would be a good idea.
