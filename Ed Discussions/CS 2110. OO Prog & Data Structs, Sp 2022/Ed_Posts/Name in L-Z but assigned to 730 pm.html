  I have a last name in L-Z and so I thought I was assigned to take the prelim 1 at 5:30 pm. However, on CMS it says I got score 0, which should mean that my assigned time remains unchanged. Yet, in the grading comments, it says:

  Please look carefully at the Canvas quiz:
 </paragraph>
 <pre>https://canvas.cornell.edu/courses/35735/quizzes/78081</pre>
 <paragraph>
  It says what is shown below. The assignment is based on netid, not last name. Take it at 7:30 in the Statler
 </paragraph>
 <pre>Please read carefully!

If your netid starts with a letter in a..k, you take the prelim at 7:30.
If your netid starts with a letter in l..z, you take the prelim at 5:30.
