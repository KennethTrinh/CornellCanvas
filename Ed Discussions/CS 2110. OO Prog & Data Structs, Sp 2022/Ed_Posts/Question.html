 I know Professor Gries says in #1707 that we need to know some of the methods of HashMaps and set, such as get and put, I don't know if this is considered something he wants us to know or not, since we never really talked about chaining in any lecture, can I get clarification?

  You do NOT have to be concerned with the implementation of hashing, in any form. You SHOULD be aware of the expected and worst-case times for for the obvious methods of HashSet and HashMap --checking the size, adding something to them, removing something, and testing whether something is in them.
