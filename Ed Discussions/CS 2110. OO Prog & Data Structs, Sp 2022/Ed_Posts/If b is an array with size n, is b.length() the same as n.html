  In some Eclipse project, in some class, put the following. When done, you can delete it
  <break>
  </break>
  (or do this in jhhell):
 </p>
 <p>
  public static void m() {
  <break>
  </break>
  int n= 5;
  <break>
  </break>
  int[] b= new int[n];
  <break>
  </break>
  System.out.println(n);
  <break>
  </break>
  System.out.println(b.length());
  <break>
  </break>
  }
 </p>
 <p>
  What happens? What is wrong? Then look in this JavaHyperText pdf file, first page, to fix the error.

  When fixed, somehow call this method to see what it prints.
 </p>
 <p>
  My point here is to help YOU find answers to this yourself, and in a way that gets you use Eclipse and become more fluent with it.
