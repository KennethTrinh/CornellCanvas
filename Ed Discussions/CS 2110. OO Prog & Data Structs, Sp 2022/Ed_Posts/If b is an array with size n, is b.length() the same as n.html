  In some Eclipse project, in some class, put the following. When done, you can delete it
  <break>
  </break>
  (or do this in jhhell):
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  public static void m() {
  <break>
  </break>
  int n= 5;
  <break>
  </break>
  int[] b= new int[n];
  <break>
  </break>
  System.out.println(n);
  <break>
  </break>
  System.out.println(b.length());
  <break>
  </break>
  }

  What happens? What is wrong? Then look in this JavaHyperText pdf file, first page, to fix the error.

  When fixed, somehow call this method to see what it prints.

  My point here is to help YOU find answers to this yourself, and in a way that gets you use Eclipse and become more fluent with it.
