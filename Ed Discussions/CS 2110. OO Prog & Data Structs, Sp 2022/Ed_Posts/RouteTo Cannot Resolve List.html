  Because of this instruction
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The ONLY case in which this method must create a list object (using a new expression new ArrayList&lt;&gt;() or new LinkedList&lt;&gt;()) is the base case, when c is the root. Do NOT create a new list object using a new-expression in the recursive case
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I only create a new list object in the base case, but then in my recursive case and in the return statement I get the error that it cannot resolve the list variable (because it is only defined within the if statement of the base case)

  In the recursive case, you can firstly create a variable like t= ch.CovidRouteTo(c), and then if t is not null, you can use the method add() to insert nodes in that list.

  With this method, do the x-ed out light bulb errors still show up on those lines where the list is referenced within the recursive case?

  If you see syntax errors you should fix that before anything else. The method Ivan described is correct and you should follow it. But we can talk about this more in a private thread.
