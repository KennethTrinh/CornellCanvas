  My code doesn't running when I enter a float as a probability. It just keeps prompting me to enter a probability. It works fine when I enter 0 or 1. What could be wrong?

  You've done something somewhere, In don't know what, because that in general does not happen. Please see a staff member, either in person or zoom.
