 I don't understand the concept of wgt too well in the first place, and also don't know how to calculate it in the assignment itself.
</p>
<p>
 So, first, would the wgt(f,w) be the length between those two nodes? And then, would we be able to use the pathSum method in some way to find this wgt(f,w) (I guess, maybe by using pathToEnd to create the path, and then inputting that path into pathSum)?
</p>

  Yes, wgt(f, w) is the "weight" or "length" of edge (f, w).
 </p>
 <p>
  Use method pathSum only ONCE, when the shortest path to end is known.
