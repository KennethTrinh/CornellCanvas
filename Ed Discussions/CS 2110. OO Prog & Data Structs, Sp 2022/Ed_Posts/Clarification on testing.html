 So if I were to make a list with multiple elements, I would do that by writing multiple append lines. So in between each of those lines I would need three assertEquals? Or just at the end when I'm done with creating the doubly linked list. I am asking this specifically for testing delete, but this question is also for in general for the assignment

  It's up to you.
 </p>
 <p>
  Testing one at a time gives assurance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Testing only after spending 4 values may take less time, but if there is an error, how do you find it?

  I suggest testing after each append. But you only need to create a linked list of size 3, say, to know that append and toStringRev work properly.

   To test your append, everytime you append something you need to have 3 assertequals statement, so in between each of those lines you'd need three assertEquals and also at the end you'd need to have another assertEquals for your final state of the linked list this guarantees what you have is correct and no mistakes were made.
