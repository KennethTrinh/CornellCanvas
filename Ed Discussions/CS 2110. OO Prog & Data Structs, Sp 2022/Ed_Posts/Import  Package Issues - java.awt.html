 Hello,
</p>
<p>
 In A6, I was able to go through most of the TODO statements without issue. However, upon reaching TODO 13, something unexpected happened with my code. An error appeared after saving the code on the package import statement:

<p>
 Running the code resolves this error, but removes many of the import statements and causes error elsewhere in the code:

 Is there anything I did wrong? I am not sure why these errors starting appearing. Let me know if I should link more code or send more information. Thank you.

  Hm, it's really hard to reconstruct what happened based on screenshots.  Not your fault -- just hard.  But it sounds like the current state of affairs is that BorderLayout is no longer being imported.  So, work that problem.  Add the import for it.  Then keep working the problem, going forward.  Let us know if that resolves it.  If not, I do recommend seeing one of our excellent consultants/TAs tomorrow during OH for their interactive help.

   Ok thank you. I think it's an issue with JPanel needing be imported and messing things up, but it's hard to explain. I'll try going to office hours and see if it resolves the issue.
