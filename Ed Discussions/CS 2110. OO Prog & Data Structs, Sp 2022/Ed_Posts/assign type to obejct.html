  Hi. I have a hard time trying to understand this.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  In the first line of code, what is happening when the type at the beginning (Animal) does not match the real type of object (cat)?

  This is what is called Polymorphism. The statement Animal anim = new Cat() creates an object of class Cat and stores it in a variable of type Animal. Therefore, at compile-time the compiler sees the variable as having type Animal, but at runtime, the variable is treated as an object of class Cat.
