 <pre>/** Update the game when the timer "goes off". If the game is inactive, does nothing. If the
     * game is active, and if the maximum number of targets has already been shown, stops the game.
     * Otherwise, respawns the target within the current component area, increments the target
     * count, and requests a repaint. */</pre>
 <paragraph>
  Is the first sentence a general summary of what the method is supposed to do or is it something we should also look out for when writing the method? If it is the latter, then please kindly explain how we are supposed to know that the time has gone off. Thank you!

  Thank you. Another question please. In TODO 6, it says
 </paragraph>
 <pre>        /** Paint dot on provided Graphics `g`. Dot is a circle with our current radius, centered at
         * our current position. Circle is filled red if we have been hit, otherwise blue. */</pre>

  I am trying to use the method checkHit to check if it the target has been hit but I'm not sure what coordinates to pass into the method. I tried using MouseEvent.getX but it keeps giving me an error. Please help, thanks.
