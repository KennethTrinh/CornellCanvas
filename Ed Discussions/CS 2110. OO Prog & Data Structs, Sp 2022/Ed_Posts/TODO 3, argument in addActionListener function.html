  Should I have an argument inside the function? Right now, I have it as (null), but I'm not sure if this is right.

  ‘When the button is clicked, start a new game’ Do you have any methods in the project which starts a game (hint: yes you do)

  Yes, I see that this is game.startGame(). Should this be my anonymous function?
