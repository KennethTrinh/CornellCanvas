 I was working on TODO 3, and had a question about the addActionListener() function.
</p>
<p>
 Should I have an argument inside the function? Right now, I have it as (null), but I'm not sure if this is right.
</p>

  You should have an anonymous function as the argument as the comments tell you to do. Please refer to the demo code from the GUI lectures as the comment tells you to

   I did look at the demo code, but I'm not sure what my anonymous function should do for TODO 3. Can I get some guidance on this?

    ‘When the button is clicked, start a new game’ Do you have any methods in the project which starts a game (hint: yes you do)

     Yes, I see that this is game.startGame(). Should this be my anonymous function?
