  Do we need to test the getters? Since they are just returning the private fields?

  Here's what the A1 handout says. I put the last sentence in italics for you to emphasize:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Consider the constructor. Based on its specification, figure out what value it should place in each of the 6 fields to make the class invariant true. In PhDTest, write a procedure named testConstructor1 that makes sure that the constructor fills in ALL 6 fields correctly. The procedure should: Create one PhD object using the constructor and then check, using the observer methods, that all fields have the correct values.
  <italic>
   As a by-product, all observer methods are also tested.
