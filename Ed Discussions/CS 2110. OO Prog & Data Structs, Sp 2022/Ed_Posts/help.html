     Hi, I have another question concerning the helper function isInSet. I am trying to avoid the cycle of recursive calls (equals-&gt;isinset-&gt;equals). Is it okay to upcast t and each covidtree in s to an Object and then check if they are equal or is that wrong? How else can I go about it? Thank you.
    </p>

      Don't avoid that, that's how it is supposed to work. If your code is right then they should call each other.
