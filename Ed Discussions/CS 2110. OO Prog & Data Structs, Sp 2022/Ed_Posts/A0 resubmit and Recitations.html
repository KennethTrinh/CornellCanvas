 Hello,
</p>
<p>
 When will we be getting A0 back, so that we can resubmit it if we didn't get a 3?
</p>
<p>
 Also is the homework assignment for this week due at the end of our individual  recitations or just on Friday.
</p>

  A0 won't be resubmitted. I think you meant HW1. If you needed to redo HW1, you would have received an email from a staff member about it. If you didn't receive an email about it, you probably don't have to redo it.

  For recitation assignments, we would like you to try to finish them during class, but if you don't finish during class, you can submit them by Friday.
