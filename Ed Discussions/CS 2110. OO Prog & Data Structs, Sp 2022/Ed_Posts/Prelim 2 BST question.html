 Hello, I am having a bit of trouble understanding what comparisons we are making with the BST in this question:
</p>
<p>
 <break>
 </break>
 Suppose a BST has been constructed by inserting the odd integers in 1..n (n is odd) into an empty binary search tree, in order from least to greatest. What is the worst-case time complexity of inserting these two values:
</p>
<p>
 • 6? Answer: O(1). No matter how big n gets, need at most 3 tests.
</p>
<p>
 • n + 1? Answer: O(n)
</p>
<p>
 I think I am having trouble visualizing the situation, so any clarification would be helpful. Thank you!
</p>

  Please construct the BST by inserting the numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 into it. Then you will be able to visualize.

   Thank you! I think I had been thinking of BSTs incorrectly the first time I tried to visualize the worst case tree.
