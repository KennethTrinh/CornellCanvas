  When we delete a node, should we also nullify the deleted node's references? So if we're removing node n, do we need to set n.next and n.prev to null? Or does it not matter since the DLList can no longer access n anyways, so it's effectively not part of the DLList anymore?

  I think you have to make DLList effectively not be able to access it and then you can set n to null. It will be eventually deleted by garbage collector after that. Also you have to adjust pointers that pointed to n.

  Yes, it is best to set the pointes in the deleted node to null so that that node can't be used to change the list.

  However, in this assignment, we don't require it and if you don't it's ok.
