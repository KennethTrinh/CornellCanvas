 Sorry this probably should be basic knowledge but could you explain what exactly is a build path? In the picture below, would the build path for project a0 consist of everything that's "below" it when you click on it (all the folders starting from JRE System Library down to A0.java)?

  The build path is mainly used to 'build' your application, so as you mentioned it contains your source files and the Java libraries needed to help compile your program/application.
