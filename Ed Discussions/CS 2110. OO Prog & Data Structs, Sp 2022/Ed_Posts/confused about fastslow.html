 In the panapto lecture 11, the professor stated that since O(n) is slower than O(n^2), O(n^2) includes all operations in O(n). However, in the javahypertext, it states that O(n^2) is slower than O(n). Also, google says that O(n) is asymptotically faster than O(n^2), and i understand the reasoning behind this. What did the professor in the panapto lectures mean by "slower" ?

  O(n) is not slower than O(n^2), all elements of the set O(n) is an element of O(n^2) but the converse doesn't hold. So O(n^2) is slower than O(n)

   Yes but do you have an idea of why the professor might have said that? He says that O(n^2) has "faster growth" than O(n) at first, but later on just refers to O(n^2) as faster ? Maybe i'm overthinking this lol

    maybe misspoke, O(n^2) definitely not faster than O(n) lol

     so all elements that are faster than a given (O..) are included in that O as well?

      Yes :) that is the definition of subset! so all elements of O(n) are elements of O(n^2) by definition since O(n) is a subset of O(n^2)

       ahh thank you and this applies to all other sets (so like O(n^3) is a subset of O(n^4) and O(2^n) )?

     I'll correct myself here, O(n) is generally faster than O(n^2) however there are instances where an algorithm that's O(n) is slower than O(n^2) for some values of n.
