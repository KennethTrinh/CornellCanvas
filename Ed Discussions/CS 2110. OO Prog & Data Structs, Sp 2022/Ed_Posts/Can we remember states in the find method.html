 In the spec for the find method, it says:
</p>
<p>
 "* At every step, you know only your current tile's ID and the ID of all&lt;br&gt;
</p>
<p>
 * open neighbor tiles, as well as the distance to the orb at each of &lt;br&gt;
</p>
<p>
 * these tiles (ignoring walls and obstacles)."
</p>
<p>
 Does this mean we are not allowed to store previously visited tiles' information and use that when not on that tile? This is still using information that would have been retrieved legally in the method.

  You can certainly save any information you want about tiles already visited.
