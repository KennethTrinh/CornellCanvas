 Good morning,
</p>
<p>
 The 3-week schedule says HW4 Hashing &amp; Quiz is due Thursday, April 28, but the HW4 quiz under Assignment Quizzes says its is due Tuesday, April 19. Could you confirm the correct due date for HW4 &amp; quiz?
</p>

  The 3-week quiz is correct.
 </p>
 <p>
  We haven't made the quiz available yet, and that is why the Assignment quizzes hasn't been updated.
