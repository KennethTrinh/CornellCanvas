 If a class extends an abstract class or implements an abstract interface, I understand that it has to override all the methods in the class/interface but can it also have methods that were not declared in the class/interface? I don't think so but I just want to be sure. Thanks!

   Oh really? I thought we couldn't because of this example

   If Circle extends shape and has all the methods of shape plus other methods not declared in shape, would this compile or run? or not? Because from my understanding, from sp's perspective it wouldn't have that new method declared in Circle. Or am I mixing up something? Thank you!
