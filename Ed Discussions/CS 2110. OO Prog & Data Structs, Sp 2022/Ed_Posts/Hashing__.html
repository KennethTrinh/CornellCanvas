  In a previous post Professor Gries said "You should know How to use hashMap and HashTable and the expected and worst-case times of many operations on them, based on their specifications. You do NOT need know know anything about the implementation."
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Can someone expand on these operations and what it means to know how to use them? What would be the operations other than "get" and assignment (Java.util. HashMap&lt;K,V&gt; m)?

  DO you know what a set is? Interface Set.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  You know the operations on it?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Well, HashSet implements that interface., so you know the important operations that HashSet implements, those of interface Set. In addition, you should be familiar with the times these operations in the HashSet implementation. For example, inserting something into a HashSet is expected time O(1) but worst-case time O(n) --even if n is 2000.

  In the same way, HashMap implements interface Map.
