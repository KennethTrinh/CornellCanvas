  My title has "class", but the one in the handout does not.

  Is this due to a difference in operating systems, or is there something I need to fix?

  You have met the specification just fine. The presence or absence of the word "class" in the title is irrelevant. And the presence or absence of the class name in the main part of the window, i.e., the message, is likewise irrelevant. (They both result from which exact methods you call on the exception object.) I guess I personally would have preferred not to have the class name showing up twice, like the handout screenshot does, but we're stuck with that for now.
