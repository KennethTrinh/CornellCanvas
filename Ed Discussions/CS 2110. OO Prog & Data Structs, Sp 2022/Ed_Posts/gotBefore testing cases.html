 i'd like a little help on how to come up with 9 distinct testing cases for getBefore. i've considered differing years (in both directions), and equal years and various differing months, and I'm still only up to 5. what's the major thing I'm missing?

  In how many ways can one date be before or after another? Think about all those cases to write your tests.

    Don't worry about number of test cases. Just make sure you cover every combination of inputs and you'll be fine.
