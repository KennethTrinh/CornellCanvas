<p>
 for the loop body, is it acceptable to have the elt at h be the elt we are looking at and sorting the array with instead of k? I understand that this is less efficent because there are more swaps, but would it be an acceptable answer?
</p>
<p>
 I wrote the loop body like this:
</p>
<p>
 if (b[h]==0) h=h+1;
</p>
<p>
 else if (b[h]&lt;0) {
</p>
<p>
 swap b[h] and b[k-1]
</p>
<p>
 k=k-1;
</p>
<p>
 else
</p>
<p>
 swap b[h] and b[k-1]
</p>
<p>
 k=k-1;
</p>
<p>
 swap b[k] and b[t-1]
</p>
<p>
 t=t-1;
</p>

  using b[h] should work, but your else statement doesn't seem to properly sort the b[h] elements. the "swap b[k] and b[t-1]" does not do anything; it is switching an element  with unknown with an element with a value &lt;0. The previous swap also doesnt properly work: "swap b[h] and b[k-1]; k=k-1;". This swaps an unknown element with another unknown element. And makes the previous b[h] or now b[k] into a value &lt;0 when you didn't confirm that it is a value &lt;0.
 </p>
 <p>
  tldr; may have analyzed ur else statement wrong, but is very confusing and does not seem to work.

  Also a question about this problem. Should this write a  k = k -1 ;  into this part? if you do not update k, b[k-1] always equal 0.
 </p>
 <p>
  Is it correct?

   I think that's a typo and should be b[k-1]==0

    nah, you cant decrement k because otherwise u are assuming that the new b[h] which is now an unknown element is &lt;0 when you didn't confirm/check that.
