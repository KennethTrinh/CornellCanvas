 So I get that the worst case of a BST is it becomes a linked list for JHT, and that means checking if a number is in the BST (similar to our node method in our assignment)'s worst case is O(n) but how is computing the depth of the BST worst case also O(n)?

  Using the same case you mentioned, you would traverse from the root node all the way to the leaf, which if we consider the BST becoming a linkedlist, would involve you traversing through all n nodes, so it would be O(n).
