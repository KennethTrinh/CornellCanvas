 I assume the answer is false, because I don't recall anything about the system automatically calling notify(), and I couldn't find any material about this in the slides/JavaHyperText either. Could I get some guidance on this?

  Yes, it is false. The only way to get threads off the waitlist is to use notify() or notifyAll().
