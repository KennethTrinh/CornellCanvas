 The work we've done with GUIs on A6 was very interesting, but I couldn't help feeling as though the visuals were a little dated. Is this a limitation of the packages we used? Is there a way we can make our game look more appealing and up-to-date? Thanks!

  Yes, Java Swing looks outdated.  This is a "feature" of any GUI library that has to be broadly cross-platform, working on any OS.  JavaFX does better, but ultimately it's going to be a problem no matter what.

  For the best look and feel, one has to work with the GUI libraries available on a particular platform.  That introduces significant software engineering challenges.  Note, for example, how MS Word is not the same on Mac vs. Windows.  Or how LibreOffice is so different from MS.

  For games, there are engines optimized to work well across multiple platforms.  Consider the Unity Game Engine (e.g. Pokémon Go).  According to Wikipedia it now supports 19 platforms.  But it is special purpose and has a proprietary license.

    In particular, INFO 1300, INFO 2300 and INFO 3450 are all classes that involve the design process. Do be aware, these classes are less about the "technology" involved with making responsive and well made designs, but rather the process itself (like user stories, thinking about requirements, usability, etc.)
