 If class Dog extends class Animal, and variable Animal pet contains a pointer to a Dog object, then the statement Dog spike= pet; is legal.
</p>

  This is because of the compile time reference rule, search this up in java hyper text. you can’t set a child class = super class;
  <break>
  </break>
  If you did Dog spike = (Dog) pet; then that’s legal however could cause a runtime error
