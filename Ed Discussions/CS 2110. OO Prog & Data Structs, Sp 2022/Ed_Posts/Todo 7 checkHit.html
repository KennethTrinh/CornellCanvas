 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 I am having trouble with checking if the mouse click's coordinates are within the target circle's area. I think I have the equation right but when I output the left hand of the equation with System.out.println(), it is never less than the radius squared even when I am clicking directly on the circle and it should be considered a hit.
</p>
<p>
 Can anyone offer any guidance on the equation/coordinate system if I'm missing something?
</p>
<p>
 Thanks!
</p>

  I recommend drawing a picture, labeling everything, then double checking your math.  That has worked for other people.  Another thing that has worked is double checking whether you are actually drawing the circle in the right place and with the right radius.  Because these problems can be one or both of the following:  an error in drawing the circle, an error in checking where the hit is.

   Thank you! I drew a picture and I think I understand more. I try to call getTargetRadius() instead of using just radius, is that neccessary to do?

    Inside
    <code>
     Target
    </code>
    it doesn't make a difference.
