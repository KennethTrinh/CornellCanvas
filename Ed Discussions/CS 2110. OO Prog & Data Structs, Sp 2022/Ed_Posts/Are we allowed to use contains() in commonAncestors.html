 I'm trying to figure out whether it is fine to use to determine if child 1 or child 2 are not in this CovidTree. Why would it or why wouldn't it be acceptable to use it in this method?

  It isn't necessary. If you want to check if a child is in the CovidTree, think about what CovidRouteTo(child1) will return if child1 is not in the CovidTree. You have to use CovidRouteTo anyway, so it would add unnecessary traversals of the tree if you were to do this in addition to contains(child1)
