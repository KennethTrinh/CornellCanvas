 When practicing jshell in preparation for lecture 2, Jshell often hung, spinning its wheels after pasting code. We troubleshooted by scouring the internet and found out that some versions of Java 11 have this problem.
</p>
<p>
 Therefore, we installed Java 12 from the website:
</p>

 <a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net/releases.html?variant=openjdk12&amp;jvmVariant=hotspot">
  https://adoptopenjdk.net/releases.html?variant=openjdk12&amp;jvmVariant=hotspot
 </a>
</p>
<p>
 choosing (1) OpenJDK 12 and (2) OpenJ9.
</p>
<p>
 Then, jshell worked!
</p>
<p>
 We then made sure that Eclipse compiler used Compiler compliance level 11 on this page:

 Preferences -&gt; Java -&gt; Compiler
