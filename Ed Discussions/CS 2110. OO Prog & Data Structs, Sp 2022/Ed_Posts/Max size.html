  I am unable to submit my recitation worksheet because it exceeds the max size. I compressed it into a zip file and it still exceeded the 100kb max. Is there a way you can increase the max size. I'm not sure what else to do. Thanks.

  I increased the size to 250MB. Try it again.

  Hi professor, I think you changed it to 250kb instead. I still can't upload it.
