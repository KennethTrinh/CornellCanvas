  I have a for each loop in my depth method
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  for(Node c : t.children)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  But it gives me an error "t cannot be resolved to a variable". I changed Node to CovidTree and it still doesn't work. The 2 Hypertext tutorials use this for each loop though, so why isn't it working? The test4depth() won't compile because of this error

  What is t? How was it declared?

  Why are you using a variable t?

 <paragraph>
  Do you know the syntax of the foreach loop?
