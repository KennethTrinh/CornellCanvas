 I have a for each loop in my depth method
</p>
<p>
 for(Node c : t.children)
</p>
<p>
 But it gives me an error "t cannot be resolved to a variable". I changed Node to CovidTree and it still doesn't work. The 2 Hypertext tutorials use this for each loop though, so why isn't it working? The test4depth() won't compile because of this error
</p>

  What is t? How was it declared?
 </p>
 <p>
  Why are you using a variable t?
 </p>
 <p>
  Do you know the syntax of the foreach loop?
 </p>
