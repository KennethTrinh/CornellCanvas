 hi, I was wondering why 2 has null in its next field

  Read the specification. Based on the specification, the list rev(h.next) is to be reversed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, it is. r points at the first node, containing the 3,
  <break>
  </break>
  that node points at the second node, containing the 6,
  <break>
  </break>
  that node points at the third node, containing the 2, and
  <break>
  </break>
  that node is the last one, its next field is null.
 </p>
 <p>
  Until you learn to understand a recursive call in terms of its specification,
  <break>
  </break>
  you will have trouble with recursion.
