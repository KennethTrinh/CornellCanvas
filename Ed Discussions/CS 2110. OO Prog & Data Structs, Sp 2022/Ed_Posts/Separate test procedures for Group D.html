  Page 7 of the A1 handout. "Did you write one (and only one) test procedure for each of the groups A, B, C, and D of step 4 and another for assert statements? Thus, do you have 4 or 5 test procedures? Does each procedure have a name that gives the reader an idea of what the procedure is testing, so that a specification is not necessary? Did you properly test? For example, in testing each constructor, did you make sure to test that all 6 fields have the correct value? Do you have enough test cases?"
