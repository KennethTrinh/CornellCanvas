  Hi everyone, a student just notified me about a typo in the function insertBefore(), as described in #594
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I just wanted to clarify this for everyone: the Javadoc spec is a typo, it should say "before" not "after". So your function should behave like the example given in the specification.

 <paragraph>
  This announcement is made in case you missed the earlier Ed thread.

  EDIT:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Update from Professor Gries in the comments! If you had already implemented insertAfter, you should be fine.

  Actually, students may have submitted already.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Therefore, the grading program will check: If they did insertAfter properly, with no errors found by the grading program, they get full credit.

  I think the difference between insertBefore and insertAfter is straightforward. Instead of inserting value v in a new node before node n, you are inserting value v in a new node after node n. If you are still implementing this part of the project, consider just doing insertBefore since you already have an example for that.

  Yes, according to Professor Gries in the comment below, you will get credit for implementing either insertBefore or insertAfter correctly.
