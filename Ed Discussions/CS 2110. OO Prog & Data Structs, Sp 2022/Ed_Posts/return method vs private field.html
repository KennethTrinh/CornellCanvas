<p>
 in group B of A1, when we have to check that an advisor is null (for example), can we access the private field directly or should we use the observer method from group A to check this? and is there a difference?

  In class PhD, we prefer accessing the fields rather than methods.

  This is not always the case, but in this short, simple class, do that.
