 Hi, I think I'm missing the point on what paintComponent() does. Is the given super.paintComponent(g) at the top for the active state? Does that mean we should start off with drawing the target and then we should set the color of g as black if the game is inactive? Why do we need the dimensions and fillrect? What I have tried so far doesn't change what the game looks like. Thanks for your help!
</p>

  I wonder whether you caught the paragraph in the handout about this.  Step 2, second paragraph.  Middle of page 5.

   Hi, yes I read that paragraph and looked at the API for Graphics and Color but I'm not sure what we're supposed to do to make it black when inactive. I just thought all you would need to do is set the color of g to black if it is inactive. I'm not sure why that doesn't do anything and why we need the dimensions and to use fillRect?

    Here's a metaphor that might help.
    <code>
     setColor
    </code>
    is like picking up a pen of the right color.
    <code>
     fillRect
    </code>
    is like putting whatever pen you have down on paper and drawing with it.  It doesn't do any good to pick up a pen unless you then draw with it.  Does that help?
