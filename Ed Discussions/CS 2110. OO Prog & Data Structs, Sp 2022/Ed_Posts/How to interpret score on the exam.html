  Hi! I was wondering if there is any informal advice how to roughly interpret how our raw scores will translate to letter grades for Prelim 2 or Prelim 1.  Thank you so much!

  It's in the email that has the subject "Your Prelim 2 for CS2110/ENGRD2110, Spring 2022 has been graded". Keep in mind that this is before the rubric was slightly adjusted.

  You know what the median and mean are. Use that.

  It is a fair question. Information about exact grade mappings just isn't something that's ever released. I encourage you to look at "Notes on Grades" on Canvas to better understand why this is. Instructors don't look at each exam individually, they look at the overall score at the end of the semester and determine grade boundaries then. Professor Gries already mentioned that the lower than usual median/mean on this exam will be taken into account. You know the mean/median, of this exam and everything else in this course (all on CMS), and you know what the general median of the class comes out to usually.

  Unless you are seriously considering dropping the course (in which case then you should talk to the instructors by email), analyzing/interpreting these exam scores just isn't a very productive pursuit. Where exactly the grade boundaries will lie is not clear at this point and will be out of your control.

  Instead, focus on what you

   can
  </bold>
  control. There's still chances to improve in this course. Focus on putting your best foot forward for the final, and the remaining assignments in the class. Learn the material the best you can. If you're not happy with how you are doing right now, there are plenty of resources at your disposal (Engineering peer tutors, office/consulting hours, the textbook, practice exams, asking questions on Ed). It'll help you get more out of the last few weeks we have in the course, and none of it depends on grade boundaries.
