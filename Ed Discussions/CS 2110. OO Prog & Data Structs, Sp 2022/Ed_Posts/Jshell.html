 I downloaded Java per the instructions on canvas, but keep getting this error when trying to activate jshell on my terminal (macOS):
</p>
<p>
 The operation couldnâ€™t be completed. Unable to locate a Java Runtime that supports jshell.
</p>
<p>
 Please visit http://www.java.com for information on installing Java.
</p>
<p>
 How should I resolve this issue?
</p>
