 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 Is there any lecture on searching? I feel like it was taught in Lecture 12 with sorting, but now is gone from the slideshow.

   In general, when posting questions, please keep them public (and anonymous if you prefer), rather than putting them as private posts, so that other students who may have the same questions can see the answers. Only post privately if you're putting up code.
