  Just follow the spec, and look at the comments. That is unnecessary traversal that will cause your method to be more inefficient.

    The spec asks you to make arrays of the two routes to the children. Before you can turn them to an array the routes are in list form. If either of them is null at that point then you know to return null since they don't share the same tree since covidRouteTo returned null for one of them.

   Don't have unnecessary traversals.
