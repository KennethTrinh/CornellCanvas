 On exams, should we write specific test cases, or would the description of how each test case is unique, like on the solutions for the past prelims suffice?
</p>
<p>
 ex: A description would be two non-empty strings of differing length, but the specific case would be "abc" and "ba"

  Either works, as long as it's clear how you're targeting distinct cases.
