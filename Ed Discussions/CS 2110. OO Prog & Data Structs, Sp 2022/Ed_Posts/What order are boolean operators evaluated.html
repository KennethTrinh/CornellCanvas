 I am used to using parenteses to control the order the operations are evaluated but eclipse automatically removes them when saving.

  That's right, formatting rules will get rid of () when they're not needed. The order is (), !, &amp;&amp;, then ||. I like to think of &amp;&amp; as multiplication and || as addition, and just use regular mathematics order of operations rules to remember them.
