  This depends don the implementation.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If a data structure is used to allow one to find a node in the tree in expected time O(1). Then, after finding the node whose priority is to be changed, change it and bubble up or down as required.

  Is there somewhere I can find the implementation for this? I tried searching it on jht but couldnâ€™t find it, because the way I think about it is we need to access all the nodes in the heap to make sure the heap invariant still holds, thus it being O(n) where n is the size of the heap
