  We want to remove nodes from the tree to see whether it's a dag, so our first step is to find a node with an in degree of 0, once we've found that node, we say 'ok this is the node that we will remove next', the part where we say 'ok this is hte node we will remove next' is make w the next node in the ordering, and when we say 'this is the node we will remove next' we also want to make sure this is the next node that is printed if we wanted to print the graph in a DAG traversal.

  Follow-up question: Why do we say "ok this is the node we want to remove next" instead of "ok this is the node we're going to remove now" meaning just removing the node and relevant edges without this intermediate step?
