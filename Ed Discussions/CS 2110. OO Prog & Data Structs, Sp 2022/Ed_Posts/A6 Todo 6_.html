 Just finished coding todo 1 through 6 and for some reason the blue dot doesn't hop around as specified in the handout. I'm not quite sure what I could be missing.

  Sounds like an error in either TODO 4, 5, or 6; but it's hard to guess.  Here's how to debug:  put in print statements (don't forget to remove them later when you're done debugging).
 </p>
 <list style="bullet">
  <li>
   <p>
    Put in a print statement in TODO 4 to make sure you're getting to the right point in it.  IF so...
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Put in a print in TODO 5 to again make sure you're getting to the right point in it.  IF so...
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Finally do the same for TODO 6.
   </p>
  </li>
 </list>
 <p>
  "Right point" here is something that depends on the logic (
  <code>
   if
  </code>
  statements) you have written, so I can't clarify any further in this post.  But you need to look at them and think about where execution is supposed to proceed based on the state of the game.

   I put in print statements in each of these methods and they worked like they should. But, I still can't figure out what the problem could possibly be.

    I guess you'll need to see a consultant when OH resume.  Meanwhile I would suggest taking a very close look at the specifications for TODOs 4-6 and considering whether your code really satisfies them.

   I think this is a bug that stems from TO DO 5, I think going over that again might help

    I was having this problem too. Check the paragraph where they talk about ToDo 4 and the manana principle. I found that my question was answered there.

     though it sounds like OP has finished through TODO 6, not just 4.
