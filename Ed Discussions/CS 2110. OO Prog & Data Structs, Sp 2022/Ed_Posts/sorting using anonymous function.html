  Do we need to know how to sort an array using anonymous functions for the prelim? Because we haven't done anything like that in class or any of the assignments but after looking up function on javahyper text like the slide at the end of lecture 1 suggests there was this pdf on sorting arrays using anonymous functions and I was wondering if we needed to know that for the test

  Anonymous functions are not on the scope of the prelim. Neither is sorting.
