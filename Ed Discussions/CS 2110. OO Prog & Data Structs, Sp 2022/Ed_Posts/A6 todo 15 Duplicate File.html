 Whenever I save the game's score to a txt file on my Mac, a Document file with the same name will be created and the scores are appended to that file rather than the original txt file. The Document file saves the scores correctly, but I am not sure why the txt file is not being updated.

  From what you've described, I'm not sure what the issue is. I'd recommend seeing a TA/consultant.
