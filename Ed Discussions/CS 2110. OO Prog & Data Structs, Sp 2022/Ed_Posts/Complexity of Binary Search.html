 One Javahypertext PDF for binary search says that because at each iteration the ? Segment is being divided into two, binary search takes O(log(n)) steps. How do we know whether the maximum number of steps or worst case is O(log(n)) or not?

  As we have written it, it ALWAYS takes the same number of iterations.

  Our algorithm does not stop when a value is found or anything like that. It stops when the ? section is empty.
