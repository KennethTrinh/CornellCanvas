  1.What is the runtime of an algorithm that runs insertion sort on an array O(n
  <sup>
   2
  </sup>
  ) and then runs binary search O(log n) on that now sorted array?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2.What is the runtime of running merge sort 4 times?
  <italic>
   n

  times?
 </paragraph>

 <paragraph>
  Would the answer to 1 be O(logn + n^2), so just O(n^2), and for the second question is it O(1), and O(nlogn)?

  For #2, it would be n^2 log n times because you one iteration of merge sort is n log n, with n being the number of items in the list to be sorted. Since you are running it n times, it would be n * (n log n) which is n^2 log n.
