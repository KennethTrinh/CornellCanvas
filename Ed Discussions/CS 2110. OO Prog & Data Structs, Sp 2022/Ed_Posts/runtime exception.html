  A runtime exception is thrown, maybe the question doesn't want you writing down if an error is raised? Can you show me the question? because this enters the if(p==p) statement which is definitely true.

   Execute the three calls C.me(-1); C.me(0); and C.me(1); on procedure m shown below. You know that calls on System.out.print print on the Console. As you execute the calls on me, place the output of the calls on System.out.print in the places provided on the right below; donâ€™t be concerned about starting each print output on a new line.

    Yeah idk about the solution, I see it throwing an Exception too this is not in another try catch block to be caught. Maybe staff can comment on this

     I think the question specifies to just place the output of the System.out.print. Because there is an exception thrown, 3 and 1 is not printed.
