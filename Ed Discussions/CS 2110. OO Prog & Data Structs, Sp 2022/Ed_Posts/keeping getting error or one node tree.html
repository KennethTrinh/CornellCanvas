 I had tried both sets in the pdf and sometimes I get this exception and sometimes I get one node tree. What should I do?

  What does the output say? It threw and unsupported operation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Where? in method insert, on line 150.
 </p>
 <p>
  Did you look there? no? Why not?
 </p>
 <p>
  What is the problem? You have not written method insert.
 </p>
 <p>
  The instructions say that the simulation will work ONLY after you have written and tested all the methods. Do not try to run the simulation before you have done anything.
