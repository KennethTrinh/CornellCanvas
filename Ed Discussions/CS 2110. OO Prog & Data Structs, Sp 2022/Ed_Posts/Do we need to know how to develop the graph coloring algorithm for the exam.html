  No. Just know it at this level:
 </p>
 <p>
  1. Color the nodes in some order.
 </p>
 <p>
  2. When coloring a node, color it with the lowest color that is not the color of a neighbor.
 </p>
 <p>
  This makes it a greedy algorithm: Try to use as few colors as possible by always choosing the lowest possible color.
