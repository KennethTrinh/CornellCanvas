   1. Do we need to enforce the preconditions with assert statements for A3?
  </bold>
  The Javadoc comment in A3.java clearly says that you do NOT have to do this.

   2. I just pasted the A3.java and A3Test.java to the src and the first line is package a3 should I rename the default package?
  </bold>
  No. The files MUST be in package a3. Use menu item File -&gt; New -&gt; Package.

   3. Are we allowed to import java.util.Arrays?
  </bold>
  Import ANYTHING that you need in the Java API documentation. Remember: To import needed import statements:
  <break>
  </break>
  On a PC, try ctrl + shift + o
  <break>
  </break>
  On a Mac, try command + shift + o
