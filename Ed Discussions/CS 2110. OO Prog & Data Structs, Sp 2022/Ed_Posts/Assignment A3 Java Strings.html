 This post will contain information about Assignment A3, which asks you to write methods dealing with Strings.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  1. Do we need to enforce the preconditions with assert statements for A3?
 </b>
 The Javadoc comment in A3.java clearly says that you do NOT have to do this.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  2. I just pasted the A3.java and A3Test.java to the src and the first line is package a3 should I rename the default package?
 </b>
 No. The files MUST be in package a3. Use menu item File -&gt; New -&gt; Package.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  3. Are we allowed to import java.util.Arrays?
 </b>
 Import ANYTHING that you need in the Java API documentation. Remember: To import needed import statements:
 <break>
 </break>
 On a PC, try ctrl + shift + o
 <break>
 </break>
 On a Mac, try command + shift + o
</p>
