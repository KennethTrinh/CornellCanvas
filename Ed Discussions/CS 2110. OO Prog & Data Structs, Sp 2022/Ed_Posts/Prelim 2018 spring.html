  Hello!
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I was wondering why this doesn't give an exception. Here the part after is a bool and since k is an int type, I was confused as to how it will allow during compile time to compare an int and bool

  The expressions are evaluated before the || is evaluated. So k == -1 evaluates to true/false, then 3 / (k + 1) is evaluated to some integer, and then 3 / (k + 1) != 4 is evaluated to some boolean value. And Then the || is evaluated on two boolean values.
