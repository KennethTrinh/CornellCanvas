  (b) Take any graph with all edge weights 1.
 </p>
 <p>
  Execute a BFS on it yourself, by hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Execute Dijkstra's algorithm on it yourself, by hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  That's the best way for you to see it.
 </p>
 <p>
  (c) Think about what a BFS does. Doesn't it first visit all 1-hop cities, then 2-hope cities, etc?
