  I downloaded the JDK and JRE files from the IBM website according to instruction, and it's just a folder of files in my download folder. Do I need to do anything with those files? Right now when I type "javac -version" into my terminal I do not get an answer.

  Did you download the "pkg" version of the JDK and JRE from the IBM website? The "pkg" contains an installer that installs everything for you without worrying about the files.

  Yes, you just need Java 11 and higher.
