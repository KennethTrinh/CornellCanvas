 Hi I am confused about using the anonymous function for the TODO 9. I understand that we have to put something that changes the property of the score inside the anonymous function. When I used getScore() it didn't work and setScore() requires an argument inside for it to be called.

  I believe you are updating the scoreLabel's text in TODO 9 so you want to use setText method and pass getScore as argument according to spec.
