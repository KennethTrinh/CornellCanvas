 If a = null, when you do "b" + null, what error does this throw, if any? I thought it would be a NullPointerException, but according to an exam, it's not.

  Why would it be an error? You are not calling a method on null, you are catenating a string and null is converted to a string.
 </p>
 <p>
  I searched this on google:
 </p>
 <p>
  The
  <code>
   concat()
  </code>
  method only accepts a String object as an argument, while the
  <code>
   +
  </code>
  operator will accept anything. If an object is passed to the
  <code>
   +
  </code>
  operator, it gets converted to a string by the
  <code>
   toString()
  </code>
  method of that object. If a null reference variable is passed to the
  <code>
   +
  </code>
  operator, it gets converted to string
  <code>
   "null"
  </code>
  .
