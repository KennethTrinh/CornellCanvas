  I am getting this error when I run Covid.java. I haven't coded anything yet; I just put in the default values when prompted.

  If you look at your methods that are unwritten, they throw an UnsupportedOperationException. This is just so the file compiles. The Covid.java file relies on the methods that you must write. So when they are run, the methods just throw an UnsupportedOperationException as you are experiencing. Write the methods and you shouldn't run into this error.

  Ohhh ok. Should we be able to still see the GUI though? From the instructions it seems like you can put in test values and it shouldn't crash.

  The GUI is only expected to run perfectly when your methods are all written. If they are not written or not right, then you cannot expect it to run correctly. This is pretty much what Professor Gries said in #1150
