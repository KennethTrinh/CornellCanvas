  Assume you have an object of class C, which is a subclass of the universal class Object. Does:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Object ob =  (Object) new C() ;
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  produce a compile time error when ob.c() is called, assuming c is solely a method of class C?

  Yes that does produce a compile time error, because method c is not a method in class object

  Whether or not the ob is cast with (Object) a compile time error would occur though right?  (if the statement was Object ob = new C(); and ob.c() was called) This is because of the compile-time reference rule
