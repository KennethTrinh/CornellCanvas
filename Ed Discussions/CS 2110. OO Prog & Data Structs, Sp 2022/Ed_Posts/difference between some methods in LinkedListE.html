 There seems to be many different methods on the LinkedList&lt;E&gt; API that do the same thing, like add(E e), addLast(E e), offer(E e), offerLast(E e)...
</p>
<p>
 Do they have different use case? Or are they just redundancy?

  Please look up what to do in the API documentation. It will take you less than a minute.
