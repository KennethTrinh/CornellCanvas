  when testing node, if we want to return the third node the linked list,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  would we have to  do d3 (being the linked list)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  assertEquals(d3.head().next().next().next(), d3.node(3)),  is there a faster way to do this?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  also just too make sure node(0) is supposed to return the head?

  Yes node(0) should return the head, also you can test for values instead rather than doing d3.head().next().next().next() so let's say at index 3 you stored the unique value '2110' you can do d3.node(3).value() and check if that equals 2110. By unique value I mean no other node except node 3 has the value '2110' and that's a valid way to test, however, I think your way of testing is valid too but that just might take long
