<p>
 when testing node, if we want to return the third node the linked list,
</p>
<p>
 would we have to  do d3 (being the linked list)
</p>
<p>
 assertEquals(d3.head().next().next().next(), d3.node(3)),  is there a faster way to do this?
</p>
<p>
 also just too make sure node(0) is supposed to return the head?
</p>

  Yes node(0) should return the head, also you can test for values instead rather than doing d3.head().next().next().next() so let's say at index 3 you stored the unique value '2110' you can do d3.node(3).value() and check if that equals 2110. By unique value I mean no other node except node 3 has the value '2110' and that's a valid way to test, however, I think your way of testing is valid too but that just might take long
