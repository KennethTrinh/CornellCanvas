 I enroll in this course yesterday and in my CMS, this course doesn't show up. Should I do something to enroll in manually? Thanks!

  CMS synchs with your student center enrollment. Sometimes we have to click a button there to get it to refresh enrollment, so as long as you're enrolled in the class on Student center, next time CMS enrollment is updated, you'll get access to it
