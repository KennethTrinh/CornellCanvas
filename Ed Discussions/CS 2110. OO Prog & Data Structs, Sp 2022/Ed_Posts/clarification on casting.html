 I'm currently reading the "cast" pdf in javahypertext, and it says that:
</p>
<p>
 the cast (S) ob is OK if ob contains a pointer to an S object but is not ok if it contains a pointer to an object of class Object. In the latter case, at runtime, a ClassCastException will be thrown.
</p>
<p>
 I'm confused because if ob already contains a pointer to an S object, what is the point of casting ob to S? Isn't the purpose of making a cast on ob to cast a pointer to the Object ob to S?
</p>

  This is just for the compiler to know that if you do
 </p>
 <p>
  S secret = (S) ob;
 </p>
 <p>
  then you can use methods in class S using the secret variable without the compiler raising an error, let's assume method .cry() is in Class S.
 </p>
 <p>
  if you did ob.cry() you'd get a compiler error (compile time reference rule) Even though the dynamic type is an instance of Class S.
 </p>
 <p>
  but if you did ((S)ob).cry() you'd not get an error.

   What's the difference between casting S secret = (S) ob and then performing method cry() on it versus doing exactly that but in one step?

    Nothing,
   </p>
   <p>
    You can do ((S)ob).cry() and that would work in the compiler's eyes, note that if ob didn't have a partition of Class S you'd get an error in runtime.
   </p>
   <p>
    ^I'm assuming this is what you meant in one step right?

     Sorry I think I misworded my question. you said that the first method of casting S secret = (S) ob and then doing ob.cry() would not compile, but doing ((S)ob).cry() would compile. my question was why would  ((S)ob).cry()  compile and the other not compile when they're essentially the same thing?
    </p>
    <p>
     Also my orignal post was basically asking
     <i>
      why
     </i>
     we would get an error in runtime if ob didn't have a pointer to Class S,  (because isn't the point of casting ob to MAKE it have a pointer to class S rather than that being a requirement)?
    </p>

      For your first question, use javahypertext for "Compile-time reference rule"
     </p>
     <p>
      2nd) Because if it didn't have a pointer to S and you tried to cast it to S you'd get an error.
