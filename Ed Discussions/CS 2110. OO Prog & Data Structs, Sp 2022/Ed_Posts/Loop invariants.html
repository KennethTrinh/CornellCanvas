  In this question, my answer is k=0 and v=b[0]. Why is that wrong?

  In this case, the invariant says that v is the minimum value of the array segment b[k..n]. If you initialize k to 0 and v = b[0], you are saying that b[0] is the minimum value in array segment b[0..n]

  well, I am kind of confused about why b[0] won't be the minimum or how to judge what is the minimum? I thought since the minimum value of k is 0, on keeping k=0, b[0] will have the minimum value?

  The point of loop invariants is that this invariant says something that will always be true at the beginning and end of each loop iteration. In this case, that invariant is that v = the minimum value of b[k..n]. With this invariant, initializing k=0 and v=b[0] violates that loop invariant for the reason I explained above. We need to find an initialization that doesn't violate the invariant

  Sorry! I am still a little confused. Why is b[0] not the minimum value?

  Because there's nothing saying that b[1] is larger than b[0] for example.

  oh alright! but then how do we know that b[n] is the minimum value?

  Because when we assign k = n, by the invariant v = minimum of b[k..n] and since k = n, the v = minimum of b[n..n], so the mimimum of that array segment must be b[n]
