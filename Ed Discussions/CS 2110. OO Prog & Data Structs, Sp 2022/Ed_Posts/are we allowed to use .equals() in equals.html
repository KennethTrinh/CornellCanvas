  It is not required to use the helper method but it is recommended. If you do not use the helper method, you are allowed to use it in equals.

  The purpose of using our helper method is to HELP you write the method. Without it, you will probably write nested loops, very difficult to understand, and add local variables or break statements and what not in order to make it all work.

  WITH the help method, it all becomes easier to write an understand. This is because when writing or understanding a call on the helper method, you refer ONLY to its specification and you do NOT look at the code in the helper method. It's time for you all to understand this kind of thing,
