 The tree with n nodes is
 <i>
  balanced
 </i>
 if its height is O(log n).
</p>
<p>
 For example, we would all say that the two binary trees on
 <break>
 </break>
 the left are balanced â€”their height, 2,
 <i>
  is
 </i>
 the minimum possible with 7 or 5 nodes. But the binary tree on the right is not balanced
</p>
<p>
 Would log 7 be .84? Why is it 2.. I think there's something I'm missing but I'm not quite sure.
</p>

 Best,

  It's a
  <i>
   binary
  </i>
  tree, so you should be thinking about it as log base 2, not 10.

   does that mean that whenever you are referring to log time for binary search algorithms that it is log base 2. And also is there ever a case when the log would not be base 2?

    We mostly always use log 2 in cs
