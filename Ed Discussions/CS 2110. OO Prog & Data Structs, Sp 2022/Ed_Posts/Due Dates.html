 I've noticed some inconsistencies for the first few homework/assignment deadlines on Canvas versus CMS. Which should we be using and can this be corrected please? This is creating some difficulty with my personal planning and I'm already a little worried about missing things....

  Could you tell us which assignments are inconsistent so we can fix them?

   I think A0 was said to due on 2/3 on canvas but 2/9 on CMS
