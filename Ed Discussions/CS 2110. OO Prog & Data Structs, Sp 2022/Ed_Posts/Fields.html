  Should the year field be restricted to only positive integers? A negative integer for the year in which a PhD was awarded seems unintuitive.

  We are not writing a class that is ready to be used by people. To do that, we would need a lot more preconditions --like the year being positive, and a person not being their own advisor. Instead, we are writing a class for you to learn about OO programming with a minimum of effort.
