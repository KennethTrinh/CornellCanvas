 Should the year field be restricted to only positive integers? A negative integer for the year in which a PhD was awarded seems unintuitive.

  We are not writing a class that is ready to be used by people. To do that, we would need a lot more preconditions --like the year being positive, and a person not being their own advisor. Instead, we are writing a class for you to learn about OO programming with a minimum of effort.

  Therefore, just implement specs as given.

   The precondition does not say so, if the precondition given doesn't say so, then don't go based off of what you want ALWAYS follow precondition, also there's BC and AD
