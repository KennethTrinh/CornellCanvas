 In part 4 for Group A we are supposed to "write a procedure named testConstructor1 that makes sure that the constructor fills in ALL 6 fields correctly". The thing is according to the handout the constructor PhD only has 3 parameters. And it also explicitly states that the field advisees isn't provided by the user but rather calculated by the program. So how would the constructor fill in those fields and how would we test them.

  You can fill them in with assignment statements, if necessary, and you test them the way you test any field.

   Read the rest of the instructions for defining the constructor, you initially have NO advisor 1 or 2 (or bull) and you have 0 advisers initially, this is what you should initialize the fields as and this is what you should test for.
   <break>
   </break>
   BTW if you declared them correctly these should be the default values already
