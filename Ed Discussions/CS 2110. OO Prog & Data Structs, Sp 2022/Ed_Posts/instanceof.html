  I see this on java hyper text:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  To determine whether an object ob has a partition named C, use ob instanceof C
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  To determine the class of object ob, use ob.getClass()
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I still don't understand when to use which. In all the past exams that I have done, I've only seen getClass(), and they were about seeing if two classes are the same class or to answer "return true iff ob is a xxx". So when (if ever) do we use instanceof? What phrasing would suggest using this?

  From my understanding, it depends on if you want to compare/check the object's status in general terms or specific terms.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For example, if obj A is a Cornell University freshman:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Using instanceof will check if the object belongs to a more broader group (ex: if A is a student). Using getClass() will check what its most specific identity is (ex: A is Cornell University freshman).

  If you want to determine whether the object can be cast to some class or interface, the instanceof will do.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If you want to know the class with which the object was created, used getClass().
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Generally when writing a method equals, look at the specification! It should give enough information for you to determine which to use.
