 Why is the complexity O(|

 |^2) for the 1st and 2nd one and O[1] for the 3rd? I'm having a little trouble understanding this.

  Because in an array we can just put whether v1,v2 is in the matrix by doing array[v1][v2] == True and accessing an element in an array is O(1),
 </p>
 <p>
  for the first and second, you can see the drawing of the matrix is O(|V|^2) where V is the number of vertices (think of it as an nxn matrix)
  <break>
  </break>
  and to loop through something that big would be a double for loop (again O(|V|^2) ) because you have to access every element in the matrix
