 We have released final grades in CMS. On your CMS home page, look near the top and click "Show Final Grade‚Äù.

 <b>
  Grade calculations.
 </b>
 For information about how we calculated your final grade, please see the "Grading notes" page in Canvas. Note that the Total Weighted Score calculated by CMS does not reflect all the notes on that page. For example, CMS does not drop your lowest Canvas Quiz, but we did in our final calculations. Further, CMS does not take into account how we handled students who missed an exam. Thus, the CMS Total Weighted Score is not the exact number we used to calculate your final grade, but for most students, it is close.

 <b>
  Median scores.
 </b>
 We do not publish cutoffs for final letter grades. Instead, we share the median score for each grade and the percent of the class who got that grade. "Median" means that half the scores were above and half were below. For example, half of the students receiving an A- had a score above 86.9, and half had a score below 86.9.
</p>
<pre>A+    97.6     1.2%
A     91.2    26.8%
A-    86.9     8.9%
B+    85.0     8.7%
B     81.3    25.6%
B-    76.0    10.1%
C+    73.3     4.1%
C     68.6     9.9%
C-    61.2     2.7%

 <b>
  Emails about grades.
 </b>
 If you are disappointed by your grade, we urge you to take some time this summer to reflect on how you can do better in future courses. See JavaHyperText for our recommendations on study skills. Also see Cornell's Learning Strategies Center
 <a href="https://lsc.cornell.edu/">
  website
 </a>
 and consider signing up for some of their services in the fall.
</p>
<p>
 To save you and us from unnecessary emails, here are answers to some questions you might be considering:
</p>
<list style="bullet">
 <li>
  <p>
   <i>
    Would you please raise my grade?
   </i>
   Sorry, no.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   <i>
    Would you please round up my score?
   </i>
   Sorry, no.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   <i>
    Would you please tell me how close I was to a boundary?
   </i>
   Sorry, no.
  </p>
 </li>
</list>
<p>
 Finally, though it pains us to have to say this: We will not answer emails claiming that your grade is not representative of your learning or capabilities, or pleading that you need some minimum grade.

  What we take away from this course.
 </b>
 We really like programming, and we hope we shared some of that joy with you.  We delighted in revealing to you some of the mystery of how software works. Please come back and take future CS courses to learn even more!
