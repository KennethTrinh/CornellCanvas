 For the Sorting HW, are we allowed to collaborate with other students, or is it all individual work?

  This is supposed to be a learning experience, and if you want to talk to others about it that's fine.
 </p>
 <p>
  But it violates academic integrity if
 </p>
 <p>
  1. One person does all the work and shares it with others.
 </p>
 <p>
  2. One person does all the work and another then verifies that the answers are correct.
