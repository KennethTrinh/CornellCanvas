 I have imported the class java.awt.Color and it seemed to work fine (eclipse doesn't show any errors), however, when I run GameMain the dots are always black. Everything else works fine but the only color that shows is black. I even tired changing the color of the background when the game is inactive (like making it red or blue) but it only shows up as black. I tried a few different things but nothing works.

  Try this suggestion: In your paintDot method, make sure setColor comes before fillOval.
