  Could someone explain why F(0) was called?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Below is my thought process..
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  n is 3 starting with function call 3
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  then because n is 3 which is not 0 or 1, F(2) is called
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  then because n is 2 which is not 0 or 1, F(1) is called
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  now because n is 1, the value 1 is returned and F(n-2) now needs to get evaluated.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  This means F(1) is called again.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  ^^ this is my thinking.. I'm not sure where F(0) comes from?

  F(3) results in F(2) and F(1) (this is the last F(1) in the chain in the solution) being called, F(2) results in F(1) and F(0) being called

  Sure, so F(3) doesn’t enter our base case so instead goes into the F(n-1) call, which would call F(2) which doesn’t go into any of the base cases, so this calls F(n-1) =  F(1) which does enter a base case, then the second part of the return statement is executed for the F(2) call which is F(n-2) = F(0) which enters a base case, then we go back to F(3) and do the call on F(n-2) = F(1) which enters a base case so we’re done.

  In the second part of the return statement, why is n=2?

  Because it’s the call of F(2) and our argument is n so n=2 (at least I think this is what you’re asking)

  because F(n-1) = F(1) finished executing so we pop the F(1) call off the stack and continue our call on F(2) which still has F(n-2)
