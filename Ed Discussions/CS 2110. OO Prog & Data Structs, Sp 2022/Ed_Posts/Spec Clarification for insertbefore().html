  Here is the specification for the method insert before:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  /** Insert value v in a new node after node n. &lt;br&gt;
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  * This operation takes constant time. &lt;br&gt;
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  * Precondition: n must be a node of this list; it may not be null.&lt;br&gt;
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  * E.g. if the list is [3, 8, 2] and n points to the node with 8 in it, &lt;br&gt;
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  * and v is 1, the list is changed to [3, 1, 8, 2] */
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>

   public
  </bold>
  <bold>
   void
  </bold>
  insertBefore(Node n, E v) {}
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The spec says to "insert value v in a new node after node n," but in the example 1 (value v) was inserted before 8 (node n).
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I mean I think the spec is supposed to say insert value v in a new node before node n right? since the method name is insertbefore.
