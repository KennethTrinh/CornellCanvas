 In lecture 20, why is the total Time for method color() O(|V| + |E|), and not O(|V|*|E|)?
</p>
<p>
 I thought that since the call to method find_color(), which is proportional to the number of neighbors of that vertex, is inside the foreach loop, then length of vertices and edges should be multiplied together for time complexity?
</p>
<p>
 I have pasted the method below.
</p>
<p>
 void color() {
</p>
<p>
 for each node v in graph:
</p>
<p>
 c= find_color(neighbors of v);
</p>
<p>
 color v with c;
</p>
<p>
 }
</p>

  Explain why you think they should be multiplied.
 </p>
 <p>
  It doesn't make sense. They get added
