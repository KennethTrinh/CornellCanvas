 <paragraph>
  In lecture 20, why is the total Time for method color() O(|V| + |E|), and not O(|V|*|E|)?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I thought that since the call to method find_color(), which is proportional to the number of neighbors of that vertex, is inside the foreach loop, then length of vertices and edges should be multiplied together for time complexity?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I have pasted the method below.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  void color() {
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  for each node v in graph:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  c= find_color(neighbors of v);
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  color v with c;
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  }

  Explain why you think they should be multiplied.

  It doesn't make sense. They get added
