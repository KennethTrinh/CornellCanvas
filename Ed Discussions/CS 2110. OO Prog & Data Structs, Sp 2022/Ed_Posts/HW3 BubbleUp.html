  I was looking at the Heap.java file provided for HW3 and question 8 asks us to fix method bubbleUp, but I don't see bubbleUp in Heap.java. Is it missing? Should we implement it?

  Look Again. Heap.java contains methods bubbleUp (line 68) and bubbleDown (line 92).

 <paragraph>
  If you don't see it, show us what Heap.java you are looking at.

  I can only see the bubbleDown function and only TODOs 2 and 3.

  Where did you get that file? Did you get it from HW3 Heaps?

  I see a very strange thing. When you view it on that page, one sees what you have. Instead, Download it by clicking the link to the right. I don't know fully what is going on here.
