  Why would these be true? Isn't appending a value to a linked list constant time while appending a value to an ArrayList is linear?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Also isn't Prepending a value to an ArrayList linear while adding a value to a HashSet constant time?

  1. Appending to a linked list and to an ArrayList can be viewed as having amortized constant time.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. The second question has to do with WORST-CASE time complexity

  So is adding a value to a HashSet worst case O(n)? If so, when would this occur?

  We said it's O(n) during the hashing lecture (linear probing and collisions etc...) review the lectures if this isn't super clear
