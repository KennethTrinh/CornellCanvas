  For the test case test80MapSeeded128(), is this test case supposed to match the graph generated when Main is run with a seed of 128?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  seed128.txt contains:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  "edge-0":{
  <break>
  </break>
  "location":["Brownsville","Ithaca"],
  <break>
  </break>
  "length":44
  <break>
  </break>
  },
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>

  but there is no edge between Brownsville and Ithaca on the graph generated in the GUI.
