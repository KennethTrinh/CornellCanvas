<p>
 For the test case test80MapSeeded128(), is this test case supposed to match the graph generated when Main is run with a seed of 128?
</p>
<p>
 seed128.txt contains:
</p>
<p>
 "edge-0":{
 <break>
 </break>
 "location":["Brownsville","Ithaca"],
 <break>
 </break>
 "length":44
 <break>
 </break>
 },
</p>
<p>
 but there is no edge between Brownsville and Ithaca on the graph generated in the GUI.
</p>
