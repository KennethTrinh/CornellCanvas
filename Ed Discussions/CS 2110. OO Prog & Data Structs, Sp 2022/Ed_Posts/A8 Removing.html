 We were told that we need to skip the first node of the list we created because we are already on it. Are we allowed to remove it from the list in order to do this? It is not giving us an error when we run it.

  You can do whatever you want! As long as it works.

  I would not do it that way. My method for traversing a given path simply says that Pres. Pollack is standing on the first node of the path and traverses it. If that's the spec, what right do I have to change the path?
