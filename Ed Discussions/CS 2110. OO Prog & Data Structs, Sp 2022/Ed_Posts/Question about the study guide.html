 On the study guide, it says that we should know the "reason for making a method in an abstract class abstract." I thought that all methods in an abstract class are automatically abstract, so this would be unnecessary.
</p>
<p>
 Also, when would be a case where an abstract class is used instead of an interface?

  No, all methods in an abstract class need not be abstract.
 </p>
 <p>
  Suppose you made class PhD abstract by putting in the word "abstract".
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, all the method in it are NOT abstract. The only result of putting in "abstract" is that now you can't create an object of class PhD.
 </p>
 <p>
  A case where an abstract class would be used is given in JavaHyperText --click the link on interfaces and abstract class in the horizontal navigation bar at the top of JavaHyperText.
