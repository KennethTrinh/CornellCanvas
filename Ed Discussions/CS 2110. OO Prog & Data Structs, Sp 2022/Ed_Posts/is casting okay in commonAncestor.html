  I am assuming you're having a problem with how .toArray() returns an Object[]. You can just do Human[] l1=c1.toArray(new Human[0]) where c1 is a List&lt;Human&gt; from CovidRouteTo and then you'll have a Human array. But the short answer to your question is: yes, casting should be ok.

  why does putting new Human[0] work in this instance? I basically had the same problem and then I did that and my test cases work. I don't understand why that works though (why it changes the return type to Human[] instead of Object[] )
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  My test cases also pass if I just cast the Object that the array returns if you don't put new Human[0].

  The reason is that that's just how toArray() works if you look at the documentation. Here is the documentation about toArray().
