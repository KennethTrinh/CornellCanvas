  Hello,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Does this mean that we can violate preconditions when constructing test cases?? We are not allowed to do so in CS 1110.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thanks!

  Since you can test with assertionThrows in Java you are allowed to make sure that assert statements are true ( you can tell this too because the question states whether to say it true, false OR an exception) in cs 1110 we were told to not violate the precondition, here in Java we have a way to test to make sure if you do violate preconditions you can still continue with your program without crashing.
