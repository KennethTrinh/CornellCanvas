 What is the difference between assert vs assertEquals methods? When do we know to use either in future projects?

  assert is used for assertions, so at the beginning of a function when you want to assert some preconditions (suppose I have a variable x of type int):
 </p>
 <p>
  assert x == 3;
 </p>
 <p>
  assertEquals() is a function used in your JUnit testing file. When you want confirm the returned value of a function is some value, you use it like this (suppose I have a function isEven() that takes in one int argument and returns a boolean telling me whether or not the argument was even)
 </p>
 <p>
  assertEquals(true, isEven(2));
 </p>
 <p>
  Very different usages in very different contexts!

   Why can't I just use an assert statement in my testing file? There shouldn't be anything syntactically wrong, correct?

    Don't do it. It is the wrong usage. Do not use  assert statements in JUnit testing procedures. Use assertEquals.
