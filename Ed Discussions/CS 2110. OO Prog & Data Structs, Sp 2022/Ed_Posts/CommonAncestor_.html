 To return the human at the root of the smallest subtree, I made each CovidRoute to an array and comparing its values until they are no longer equal, also account for if they are not null, how do I instantiate a variable that holds a human variable so that it keeps updating to the greatest arr[i].

  You should have two arrays of humans. Have a loop variable set to 0. Then loop through the indices of the arrays. Loop while you don't go over the length and while they share the same elements. Once they don't share the same element then you know you found the human at the root of the smallest subtree. Return that human. If the loop variable stays at zero and the first elements aren't the same that means the tree doesn't share the humans, so you return null. Otherwise, you know the first element is the same so your return that one. The loop is slightly more complicated than I explained, but you should be able to figure it out.
