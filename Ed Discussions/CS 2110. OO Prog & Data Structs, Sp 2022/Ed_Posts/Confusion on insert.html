  I was a bit confused about what the method insert was supposed to do. It says "Given p a new child, a node with Human c. Return the newly created node." So are we supposed first to add p to c (link them up like A4).  If so, I'm a bit confused on how to connect the nodes together, because they don't have a head/tail as they did in A4.

 <paragraph>
  public CovidTree insert(Human p, Human c)
  <bold>
   throws IllegalArgumentException
  </bold>
  {}
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Also, I was a bit confused about the part I bolded. What does it do? (does that cover the " p or c is null, or p is not in this CovidTree, or c is already in this CovidTree. return error")

  1. The specification lists the conditions under which an IllegalArgumentException should be thrown.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  That  bolded throws clause is how one can indicate that the method throws an exception. Please look up "throws" in JavaHyperText for a full explanation.

  2. It says: "Given p a new child, a node with Human c. Return the newly created node."
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Well, create a new node and make it a child of p. Look at the fields of the class. Where are the children?
  <break>
  </break>
  As you create the new node, save a pointer to it; that is what is to be returned.

  I'm still a bit confused. Is var the node? The children are in the set children. Is the question just asking us to add the child p into the set children that contain the node c?  And then return the newly added node?

  Yes. That's what it says to do.
