  The assignment page mentions there are &gt;25 tests to check assert statements? Is this the amount we need?

  It's about 25. DOn't be concerned with the exact number.

  Look at your assert statements and put in an assertThrows for each individual part in them. That is all.

  I can only find 16 of them. I wonder how there can be about 25? I have one for each precondition (the month being between 1 and 12 counts as two)
