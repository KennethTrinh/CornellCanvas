 In the answer below, the first step is to "Have some class C implement an interface IN that is connected with the event." What does it mean by, "connected with the event" ? I don't understand the specific way in which they'd be connected.

  This is a generalized explanation of what we did in A6. In A6, the interface connected with the event was ActionListener, which we implemented using an anonymous function. Other interfaces "connected with the event" might be ones for low-level events, property changes, etc..
