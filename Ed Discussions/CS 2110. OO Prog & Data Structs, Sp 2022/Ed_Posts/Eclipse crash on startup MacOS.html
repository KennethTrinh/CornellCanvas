  Eclipse has been working fine for me since I installed it, but today it has constantly been crashing on startup. I installed the 2020-12 version, and it still crashes.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I get the message:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Eclipse quit unexpectedly. Click Reopen to open the application again. Click Report to see more detailed information and send a report to Apple.

 <paragraph>
  I tried using -clean in the terminal but it didn't work.

  I tried that as well and it doesn't work, as well as uninstalling and reinstalling eclipse, and restarting my mac.
