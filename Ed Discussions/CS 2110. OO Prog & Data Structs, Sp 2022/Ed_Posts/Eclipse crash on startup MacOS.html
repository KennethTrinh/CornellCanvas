 Eclipse has been working fine for me since I installed it, but today it has constantly been crashing on startup. I installed the 2020-12 version, and it still crashes.
</p>
<p>
 I get the message:
</p>
<p>
 Eclipse quit unexpectedly. Click Reopen to open the application again. Click Report to see more detailed information and send a report to Apple.
</p>
<p>
 I tried using -clean in the terminal but it didn't work.

  Try starting in a new workspace, with nothing in it...

   I tried that as well and it doesn't work, as well as uninstalling and reinstalling eclipse, and restarting my mac.
