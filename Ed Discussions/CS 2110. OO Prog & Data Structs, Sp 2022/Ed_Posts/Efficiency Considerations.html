 For the moreThan1 method in A3, is it inefficient to use s.isIndexOf(t) in all cases or if used once is that ok ,or will it still be executed several times as mentioned in the principle comment?

  Yes of course you can call it once. But calling it twice the same string and same arguments can be wasteful.

  Sometimes, when writing a throw-away program to do something, we don't worry about such things. At other times, when writing an application that people will use often, we ARE concerned about such things. Right now, we want you to start thinking about efficiency considerations.
