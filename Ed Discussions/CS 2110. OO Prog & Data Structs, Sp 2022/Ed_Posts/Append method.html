  my append method is failing the given assert to ensure that there is 1 element in the linked list. toString() verifies that [2110] is in the linked list, so then why is the size 0 of the linked list?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  EDIT: are we supposed to increment size in append()?? I do this and it works

  Did you increment the size in your append() method?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  EDIT: Yes, you must increment the size. There is no other way size will increase when you append. Just do size++ in your append method body.

  There is something called the class invariant --the set of comments on the fields of the class. Every method starts with the class invariant true and is supposed to end with it true --so you must change variables to keep it true.
