 Are we allowed to download the slides? If so, how? I was reviewing the lecture slides, but there isn't a button for me to download.
</p>
<p>
 Thank you,
</p>

  Please do not delete questions. Others might have the same question.

  If you are not able to download, tell us which page you are looking at and what you are trying to download, and we can fix a mistake if there is one.

   Yes you should be able to download the slides. There is a tiny link just after each link (i.e. the space after the link is a download link)
