 I was trying to study the content for the Java Collections framework (HashSet, HashMap, ArrayList, etc.), but couldn't find materials to study with. Are there any useful JavaHyperText entries for studying this, or did any lectures cover this material?
</p>
<p>
 Help greatly appreciated.

  Just as important. Read what the API documentation says.

  Example, google     java ArrayList

   Lecture 8 covers material on List, ArrayList, and LinkedList and we also covered collections briefly in recitation 3.
  </p>
  <p>
   Additionally, you can look up Map, Set, and Heap in the JavaHyper Text (instead of specifically HashSet and HashMap)!
  </p>

   I hope this helps some :)
