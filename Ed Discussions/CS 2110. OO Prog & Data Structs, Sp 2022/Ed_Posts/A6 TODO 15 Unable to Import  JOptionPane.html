  I wonder what would happen if you deleted that import, commented out all the code that references JOptionPane, saved the file, then quit and restarted Eclipse. Then uncomment the JOptionPane code and let Eclipse re-add the import line for you.

  (I don't know why this is happening for you.  But this fix worked in a similar situation for someone else.  It seems to be an Eclipse bug.)
