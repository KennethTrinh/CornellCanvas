 Hello,
</p>
<p>
 We are in the midst of grading.
</p>
<p>
 There are makeup Finals for those who could not take the Final this morning (e.g. because of covid isolation) on Wednesday and Friday at 9AM. We won't make your score on the Final available until those makeup Finals are completely graded. We expect that to be some time Friday late afternoon.
</p>
<p>
 As soon as the makeup Finals are regraded, we will open Gradescope for regrades requests. We expect to give you only until next Sunday night to complete regrade requests —that's two days— because we then have to work hard on grades for the course.
</p>
<p>
 So, until Friday afternoon, relax! Work on your other courses.
