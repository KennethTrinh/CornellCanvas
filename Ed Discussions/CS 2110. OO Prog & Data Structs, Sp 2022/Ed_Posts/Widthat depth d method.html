  Please look CAREFULLY at the comment that say: if d &gt; 0, the answer is: sum of widths of the children at depth d-1.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Then look just as carefully at your recursive call w.widthAtDepth(d+1);
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Look at the tree below.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  What is the width of tree A and depth 2.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Next, what is (the width of tree B at depth 1) + (the width of tree C at depth 1) ?
