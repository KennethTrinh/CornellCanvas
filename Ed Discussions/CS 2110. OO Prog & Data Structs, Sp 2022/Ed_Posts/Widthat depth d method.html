 Hi im still a bit confused for width at depth d.

<p>
 i am unsure how to  write a program  that would count the width at depth d i tried reading the hint bit I am having trouble understanding it. this is what i have so far i know it is incorrect but I was wondering how I can improve upon it.

  Please look CAREFULLY at the comment that say: if d &gt; 0, the answer is: sum of widths of the children at depth d-1.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then look just as carefully at your recursive call w.widthAtDepth(d+1);
 </p>
 <p>
  Look at the tree below.
 </p>
 <p>
  What is the width of tree A and depth 2.
 </p>
 <p>
  Next, what is (the width of tree B at depth 1) + (the width of tree C at depth 1) ?
