  When referring to Kruskal's algorithm, does it mean the subtractive version when you start with a graph containing cycles or the additive version where you start with all the nodes disconnected? "Kruskal's" referred to both from a different class I took so I want to check.

  We said that a subtractive version should not be used because too many edges have to be deleted.

 <paragraph>
  So for Kruskal and Prim, it's the additive method. Add n-1 edges.
