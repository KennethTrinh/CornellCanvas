 I'm having trouble trying to write the for each loop to iterate over the neighbors (w) of the current Node we're looking at. How do I look at the neighbors of any other Nodes besides those of Node v without using something like recursion?
</p>
<p>
 I've tried to use the exits of v as an option, but it gets complex with the sink() and source() functions required to be checked each time (which also confuses me, because this is supposed to be an undirected Graph with no source and sink concepts, at least I thought).
</p>
<p>
 This is connected to my next question: what Set/List/ Data structure is there to use a for each loop on to directly find the neighbors of v and any other Node we're looking at? When we've used the concept of "neighbors" prior to this, there has always been a clear "neighbors" variable implemented with some data structure, and I've looked through all of the code and just can't seem to find it.
</p>
<p>
 I can provide any more clarification if needed.
</p>
<p>
 Thank you!
