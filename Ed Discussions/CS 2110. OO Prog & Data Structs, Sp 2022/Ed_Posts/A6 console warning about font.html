 Warning: the fonts "Times" and "Times" are not available for the Java logical font "Serif", which may have unexpected appearance or behavior. Re-enable the "Times" font to remove this warning.

 just to make sure it doesn't count as a printout at the console right?

  We can't know based on what you tell us whether this is because of an error in your code, or because of some strange configuration on your own system.  It certainly is a printout at the console though.
