  In this line, could you please tell me if my thought is right and then help me with the remaining part? I've been trying to figure it out for a while
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  d[w]= d[f] + wgt(f, w)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  d[w] is the distance from the SandF(hashmap) to w?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  d[f], the same thing but to f?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  wgt(f,w), I am struggling to find a way to find the distance between this two. There's not given method to find the distance between two nodes. A little guidance will be appreciated. Thank you!
