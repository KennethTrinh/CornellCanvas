<p>
 In this line, could you please tell me if my thought is right and then help me with the remaining part? I've been trying to figure it out for a while
</p>
<p>
 d[w]= d[f] + wgt(f, w)
</p>
<p>
 d[w] is the distance from the SandF(hashmap) to w?
</p>
<p>
 d[f], the same thing but to f?
</p>
<p>
 wgt(f,w), I am struggling to find a way to find the distance between this two. There's not given method to find the distance between two nodes. A little guidance will be appreciated. Thank you!
</p>
