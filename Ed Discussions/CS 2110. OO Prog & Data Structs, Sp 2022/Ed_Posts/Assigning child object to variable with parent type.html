 Assume Cat is the child of Animal. Cat has a method called meow(), which the Animal class does not. Let's write this assignment.
</p>
<p>
 Animal an = new Cat ();
</p>
<p>
 Just to make sure, the dynamic type of "an" is Cat. It's static type is Animal, which is why you couldn't then call an.meow()?

  The compile-time reference rule tells you that an.meows() is illegal and won't compile, because it can't be guaranteed that method meows() will be present at runtime.
 </p>
 <p>
  Remember, at compile-time, only the TYPES of expressions are used, not their values. Thus,
 </p>
 <p>
  Variable an has (static) type Animal. class Animal and its superclasses do NOT have method meow().
  <break>
  </break>
  Therefore an.meow(). is illegal and won't compile.
 </p>
