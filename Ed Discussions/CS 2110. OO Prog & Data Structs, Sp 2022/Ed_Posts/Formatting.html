 Hello, when I open A2.java in eclipse, I do not see the comment at the top to fill in my name etc.. It says "Please provide the following information," but nothing after it.  This could be because when I first downloaded the zip file, it downloaded to Atom editor and I then had to open it in Eclipse. What is the right way I should download the files so that it opens to Eclipse automatically or if that is not the problem, what do you suggest I do?

  Nevermind! There is a (+) button that expands the comments.
