  I was using things like n.prev.next and n.next.prev in the delete() method, to change the appropriate fields. My partner asked me, "Isn't n.prev.next the same thing as just n?" I think the answer is no, but didn't have a good answer to this. Could I get some help here?

  n points at a node.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  n.prev point at the previous node.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Therefore, n.prev.next point as th node after the previous node, which is n.

  If I replace n.prev.next with just n in my delete() method, the test case fails. If I do it with n.prev.next, the test case passes. What could be the difference here? I asked a TA in office hours today, and told me that there could be a difference, but had a little trouble understanding what it is.
