 Is it acceptable to write more test cases than the number of test cases you are asked to write on an exam?

  Only the first x test cases will be considered if you write more than x test cases (x is the number we'd ask for)

   So if for example the question asked for 5 and we wrote 7, even if 2 of the first five were incorrect you wouldn't look at the additional cases we wrote and we would still get 3/5 even if the last two were correct?
