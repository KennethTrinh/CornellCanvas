     Students who have been assigned to the 5:30 pm exam.
    </bold>
    To better deter any discussion of the exam between the 5:30 and 7:30 offerings, we ask you to stay in the exam room until 7 pm. If you finish early, turn in your exam to a proctor, then sit in your seat quietly and read non-digital materials until the exam concludes at 7 pm. Please make sure to have printed materials available; phones and tablets will not be permitted.
