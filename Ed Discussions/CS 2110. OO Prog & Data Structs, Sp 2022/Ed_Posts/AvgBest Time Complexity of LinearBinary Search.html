  Can you assume that the best time complexity of linear/binary search is O(1) in the case that
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  you find your value at a specific spot in the array (ex. fourth element, so size doesn't matter)?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  In this case can you assume that average will be:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Linear: O(n/2)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Binary: O(logn/2)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  ?

  Linear search, yes.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Binary search, it depends on how it is written.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The way we write it, no.
