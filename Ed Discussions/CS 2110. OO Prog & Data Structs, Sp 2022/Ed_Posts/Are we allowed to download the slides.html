  Yes, this page is in error. Canvas does not have the proper links.
 </p>
 <p>
  We just fixed this/ Sorry for the mistake.
 </p>
 <p>
  The problem was that we were linking to files in a previous version of the course, and such external links are not shown by Canvas the same way that links to this version of Canvas are shown.
 </p>
 <p>
  Therefore, we just copied those files from the previous version into this version and reedited the page.
