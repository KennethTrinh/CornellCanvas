 I could not upload my recitation worksheet to CMS as Word or pdf because it exceed file size, but the plain text version does not show the array diagram I drew for number 6. What should I do?

  Delete the array diagram. You can try to explain it in words/math notation. We will not closely at this.

  Just do the best you can and submit.
