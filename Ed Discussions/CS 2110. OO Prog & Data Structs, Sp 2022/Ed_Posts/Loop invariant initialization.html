  when we have loop invariants and we have to initialize, how can you tell from looking at the diagram that you set int j = 0 or int j = -1 (for the variable j on the diagram such that everything to the left of it satisfies something)?

  Whether it's on the left or right of the line, right indicates 0, left indicates -1, however, I recommend using follower-first

  so if the line is right of j, does that mean that the last thing in the range encompassed is b[j-1]? and thus j-1-0+1=0 and j=0?

  I'm confused then about why b[j] is not encompassed in the range if the line is to the right of j. In general, does the line corresponding to the jth element in array b lie to the left or to the right of it?

  If the line is to the right of j then b[j] is in that segment, why is it not?
  <break>
  </break>
  If a line is to the right of j, b[j] is in the range, if a line is to the left of j b[j-1] is the last element in the segment before that.
