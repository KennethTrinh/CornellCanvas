  I am working through old prelims and am confused about the solution to 4a. Why can you write b(i) to store the indices in the new arraylist instead of b.add(i)?

  .add is a valid ArrayList method and since you initialized b to be an ArrayList that stores intergers and you are guaranteed that i is an Integer your code would compile if you used add.

  If you're confused whether you're allowed to use a method or not just refer to
  <link href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html"/>
  https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html and see if it's there

  so if you did b.append(i) you'd lose points.

  My question is: why doesn't the written solution use b.add(i), but just uses b(i). Does that mean it is a typo? The screenshot I posted is from the posted solutions.

  Confirming here for others who might read this post. This is a typo. b(i); should be b.add(i);
