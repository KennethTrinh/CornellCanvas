 <paragraph>
  In the heaps quiz, there are often heaps represented as arrays like "(8, 2, 1, 3, ?, ?)".
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Do those question marks mean there are empty values there, or do they mean that those are values in the heap that we just don't know. Basically, when we draw the tree with those question marks, should we include the question marks in the tree or just imagine that they dont exist?

  The question marks are array values that are NOT in the heap. That is all. The array "(8, 2, 1, 3, ?, ?)" denotes a heap of size 4.
