 The instructions say that testing the gotBefore() functions requires 9 test cases. Does this mean that we should make the 9 test cases as a part of our grade or is it just telling us that you guys will use 9 test cases to check us?

  It is not "a part of your grade". It is something that you should do because that is the proper way to test the function. Yes, we will look and see whether you did it properly.
