 In the instructions for A6, TO DO 4, it says "the default color could change depending

 on the OS, dark vs. light mode, etc". My partner and I used the super method as specified in the directions, however, when we changed the computer OS (along with the eclipse mode) from light mode to dark mode, the default background stayed the same color. We're not quite sure how to get the default color to change depending on the OS.

  That is just an example of the reasons it might be necessary.  Don't worry if you can't recreate it on your particular OS.  Actually the main reason has to do with transparency, which generally isn't an issue on either Mac or Windows but can be on Linux.  But this isn't important.
