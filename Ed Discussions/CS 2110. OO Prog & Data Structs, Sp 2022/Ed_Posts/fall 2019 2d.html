<pre>public class S {
  private int a= 2;
</pre>
<pre>  public S() {
     System.out.println(a);
     int a= 5;
     a= this.a + 1;
     System.out.println(a);
     System.out.println(a + this.a);
}
}</pre>
<p>
 Although subclasses cannot access private variables in the superclass, why did the first print statement of a still print 2?

  Youâ€™re still in the same class (this is the constructor method of Class S not a subclass ) it still has scope of the private fields. So the first a refers to the private field a, which has int value 2.
