 How do I know what the complexity of something that is in log time is... constant, quadratic, cubic and others make sense but log time makes negative sense.
</p>
<p>
 Is there any practice for complexity
</p>
<p>
 Thanks in advanced

  Please read this page in JavaHyperText, which is all about understanding log time:

  I found it by typing  "log". into the JavaHyperText Filter Field.

  If, after studying that page, you still have questions, ask again!

   How are algorithms that double in o(log n) time and not in quadratic time

    Compute n = 2^k by increased doubling multiplying by 2.
    <break>
    </break>
    Look at the table below. To calculate 32 = 2^5 by doubling took 5 steps.
    <break>
    </break>
    log (32) = log(2^5) = 5.
   </p>
   <pre>value     number of times doubled
 1 = 2^0         0
 2 = 2^1         1
 4 = 2^2         2
 8 = 2^3         3
16 = 2^4         4
32 = 2^5         5</pre>
