  How do I know what the complexity of something that is in log time is... constant, quadratic, cubic and others make sense but log time makes negative sense.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Is there any practice for complexity
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thanks in advanced

  Please read this page in JavaHyperText, which is all about understanding log time:

  I found it by typing  "log". into the JavaHyperText Filter Field.

  If, after studying that page, you still have questions, ask again!

  Compute n = 2^k by increased doubling multiplying by 2.
  <break>
  </break>
  Look at the table below. To calculate 32 = 2^5 by doubling took 5 steps.
  <break>
  </break>
  log (32) = log(2^5) = 5.
 </paragraph>
 <pre>value     number of times doubled
 1 = 2^0         0
 2 = 2^1         1
 4 = 2^2         2
 8 = 2^3         3
16 = 2^4         4
32 = 2^5         5</pre>
