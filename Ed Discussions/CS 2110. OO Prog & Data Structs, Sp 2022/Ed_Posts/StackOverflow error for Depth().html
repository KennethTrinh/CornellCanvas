  Even though I keep recursing through each child, and return, I keep getting a stackoverflow error and have no idea why. Any help would be appreciated!

  StackOverflow means the stack is full, and you cannot use up any more space in the stack. This can happen from infinite recursion.  Your base case could be a problem. Do you return 0 if human equals p? If the problem isn't the base case, do you have a return statement inside your for loop? Also, you need to return -1 if p is not in the tree or if p is null(you don't need a special if statement for this).  You should have three distinct return statements for this method.

  What would be returned in the for loop? That part may be messing up my algorithm.

  if the depth is not -1 from your recursive calls then that means you found where p occurs. So you return 1 + depth of p in c ( this is straight from spec).

  Yeah i have that, this is very odd to me. Perhaps i'm not recursing correctly. To be clear, I would do a for-each loop for the children, then take the depth() of the human of each CovidTree object in the for-loop, right?

  Yes, the loop should be a for loop over the children as you mentioned. There should be a variable that stores depth, and it should store the return of the call depth on the child with argument p. If the variable doesn't have the value of -1 then you know you found p in the CovidTree so you return 1+ depth of p. If this still doesn't resolve your issue then do as Professor Gries said, and post your code privately so the course staff can help.

  I am trying to figure out how to return -1 if p is not in the tree without using any if statement, do you have any hints? I am not sure how the variable that stores depth will ever equal -1 if we only need one base case for if human equals p

  Just have a return statement at the end that returns -1. To ensure that your method  only reaches there when p is not in the tree, you want to return the depth variable+1 , only if that variable isn't equal to -1. Everything I said after my first sentence needs to happen inside the for loop. I suggest you look at getParent() which is towards the bottom of the file. Depth is very similar to this method. Apologies for the late reply.

  Post your method in a private note.

  I realized my mistake, I was calling the depth() method completely incorrectly where it was calling it for the same object over and over rather than the new recursed object.

  I am calling it to the new recursed object as well but then now I just keep getting the depth returned as 1 for any node whose depth is greater than 1.  Any pointers? I did what Atulya said and this is still happening

  Is your method depth a searching or a counting method? Tell us that, and why you think so. Remember, the return type, the returned value, hav NOTHING to do with what kind of method it is.

  Searching method because i'm looking for a specific node. I think im writing things correctly, so I'm getting very confused by this error.
