 I completely missed the fact that the Canvas Quiz for lectures 11-14 was due yesterday, and assumed it was HW 3 that was due. This was an oversight on my part, but I am wondering if there is some way I can make this assignment up rather than getting a 0 on it?

 Appreciate it.

  This question was asked quite a bit in the past but I think it's worth sharing again, so I made it public + anonymous.

   Unfortunately, extensions/make-ups aren't given for Canvas Quizzes (except for very extreme circumstances). On the bright side, you do get the lowest one dropped, and in general, they are only ~1% of your final grade each.
