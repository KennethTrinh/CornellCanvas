 The example video of the game doesn't work for me, am I supposed to be able to click the dot multiple times before it disappears?

  By "The example video of the game doesn't work for me" I guess you mean that your game doesn't behave the same way as the example video, rather than you can't play the video.

  Yes, as the video demonstrates, you should be able to score up to 10 points, one point for the first hit on each place the target spawns.

   I actually meant that I couldn't play the video, but I fixed that (finally). If it only registers the first click, which TODO is responsible for that, because I don't remember seeing that step. My game is done, and it looks just like yours, except every click adds to the score. Honestly, I like it that way because then a high score takes some skill, but I don't want to lose points over it.

   Which TODO says to only register the first click?

    TODO 8 "new target hit", combined with TODO 7 "not already hit".  You'll want to fix that to not lose points.  (Well points in your assignment score that is.  Actually the player of your game will be able to score fewer points haha.)

    Sorry you don't like the game as-is; certainly there are lots of extensions possible.  See the handout, section "Submission", final paragraph, page 10.  You're welcome to make your own private version of the game that does whatever you want.  But the version submitted in CMS needs to adhere to the requirements.
