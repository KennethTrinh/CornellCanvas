  The grading rubric for Prelim 2 Question 4C took off points for changing the set s, but since the instructions and spec both did not mention that s should not be modified, shouldn't an implementation that does so be fine?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  More generally, is it assumed / expected that a method on a set will not change the set unless necessary or if it is the purpose?

  Changing s would be a side effect of the function that should NOT happen. From a user's perspective (someone who only views the specification and the uses the function without looking at implementation), if there were any side effects (such as modifying the set), that would be explicitly stated. Otherwise, the user should assume no side effects to the set.

  Consider Java class ArrayList. The spec of method contains does not mention that it does not change the list. But if its implementation actually changed it YOU WOULD BE FURIOUS!

  A method does what its specification says, no more no less.
