 What is the super. doing? I reviewed the slide but still confused.
</p>
<p>
 in slide it said:
</p>
<p>
 Â¨paintComponent(): Preferred method to override when extending Swing components
</p>
<p>
 Start with super.paintComponent()
</p>
<p>
 also, when I call paintComponent(), because I have super.paintComponent() in first line, I feel I am calling the method body again and again and never stop, but in fact it just run once, why?

  First, let's note that
  <code>
   super.
  </code>
  is something independent of Swing.  It's a Java feature.
 </p>
 <p>
  Second, please search for "super" in JavaHyperText.  You'll find keyword
  <code>
   super
  </code>
  and two descriptions of it.  The first describes what is going on here.  It mentions "bottom-up" and "override". Search for both of those in JHT, too.
 </p>
 <p>
  Third, as for why it's useful in this specific case, please review the A6 handout, step 2, paragraph 2 (page 5).
