  I'm still not sure how we are supposed to not use contains() in depth().
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If I've written it using contains(), am I on the right track or will I have to completely redo everything to get rid of the contains()?

  Do not use method contains.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  What does that tell you? It returns a boolean, false or true.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  What does a call on c.depth(p). where c is a child return? -1 or a value &gt;= 0.
