  I thought in order would traverse the left side first, so we call the left subtree of A (the root), which then calls the left subtree of that tree, which would be the first thing printed, so when I see this I think B is at the bottom left, why is my thinking wrong, like if it was a subtree like the way described, I get from preorder why it's that, because everytime the root is printed first then the left subtree then the right, so it would go, I don't get how to determine if it's a left or right subtree either if it's a leaf
