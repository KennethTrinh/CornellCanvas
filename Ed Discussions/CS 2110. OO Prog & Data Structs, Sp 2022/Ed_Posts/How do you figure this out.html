 <p>
  A is valid because that's just adding everything to the stack first, and then popping everything off.
 </p>
 <p>
  for B, you could pop D off and then pop E off, as that means you pop D off before you add E. now A, B, C are left. So you can pop C , B, A in order.
  <break>
  </break>
 </p>
 <p>
  for C, after adding A,B,C,D to the stack you could pop D off before E is added, and then pop C off and there are only values A, B in the stack at this point. then you could add E and then pop it off, so the sequence DCE so far is valid. but then you pop A off, which cannot happen because A, B are still in the stack and B comes before A in the last-in first-out ordering of a stack.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  for D, this is valid because this results from  popping each value off the stack before adding the next value onto the stack.
