 Given a tree [A[B[C] D[E]]:
</p>
<p>
 If I try to call A.insert(..., C); it should fail because tracing through the children I can already find a node that contains the value C.
</p>
<p>
 But if I try to call D.insert(..., C); it will not be able to trace that C is already in the big outer tree, since C does not branch from D. Thus it will add C to a subtree with D at its root, but then C will show up twice if I try to print out tree A.
</p>
<p>
 Is this desirable behavior? Do I only care if it's not in the subtree of the CovidTree from which the method is called?

  Here's the rule, straight from line 52 of the CovidTree.Java:
 </p>
 <p>
  * Important note: Each human in the Covid tree is unique.
 </p>
 <p>
  Therefore,  D.insert(..., C);   should not be done.

   Thank you for the clarification, this makes sense. I suppose part of my confusion stemmed from trying to figure out how to access a parent.
  </p>
  <p>
   If D.insert(..., C); is not desirable, should I move up the tree toward the root so I can check to see if the whole tree does not contain the inserted node? Or is it a precondition that we are always going to be calling insert from the root of the main tree?

    Given only a node, there is no way to get its parent.
