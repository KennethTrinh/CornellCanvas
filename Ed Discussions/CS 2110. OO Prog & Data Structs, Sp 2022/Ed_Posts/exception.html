 Hello!
</p>
<p>
 I am trying to get a basic idea of what exception is called when and am confused about the difference between the subclass exception and runtime exception.

  A runtime exception is just a subclass of exception. I don't think others were mentioned, but there are probably other subclasses of exception. The subclasses allow you to customize which kinds of errors you want to deal with in certain ways, while a more super of an exception class encompasses all of these individual types of errors.
