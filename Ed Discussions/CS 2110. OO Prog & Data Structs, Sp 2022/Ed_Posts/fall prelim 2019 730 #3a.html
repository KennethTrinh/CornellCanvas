 1. Why do we have to cast ob to the class Vehicle? If ob passes the if statement in line 1, that means it is of the Vehicle class.
</p>
<p>
 2. Is it valid to say: return obA.color.equals(this.color)? Why are we allowed to say obA.color.equals(this.color)?

  I would agree that the first question can be answered by looking up "equals" in JHT, as the example in the textbook is extremely similar.
 </p>
 <p>
  For your second question, this.color is also valid, but it's not necessary. It just means that the field is of
  <b>
   this
  </b>
  instance. However, that is implied here so
  <b>
   this.
  </b>
  is not necessary.

   DO you know the compile-time reference rule?
  </p>
  <p>
   Look it up. If, after reading it, you don't fully understand, ask a more specific question.

    I've read it and it makes sense. For clarification, 1) do the subclasses inherit the methods of the parent class? However, the danger is when you have a parent class, then you cannot access the methods of the subclasses. You can
    <i>
     only
    </i>
    access the methods of the subclasses if you downcast to the subclass. Is this correct?
   </p>

     Yes, we downcast because that will allow you to access the methods of the class you are downcasting to. A parent class cannot access the methods of its subclass. A subclass
     <b>
      can
     </b>
     access all inherited methods of its parent class.

      Ohh I understand now my confusion stemmed from the fact that I didn't realize that ob was of type Object and not Vehicle. Thus, ob is in the parent class Object and not in the subclass Vehicle. Thank you!

       But if the static/dynamic type of ob is Object, shouldn't it return false right after the execution of the if statement? Doesn't entering the second line mean that ob is of type Plane?

        Yes, the dynamic type is Plane, not object.

        <p>
         Then why do we still have to cast down ob, given that it is of type Plane? What's the meaning of casting a Plane to Plane?

          Because the static type is Object, and the code would not compile (specifically the part the references the Planeâ€™s fields) if we did not cast to a Plane object.

    Please post a screenshot of the question too so that others can see the question. This also makes it easier for course staff to answer your question.
