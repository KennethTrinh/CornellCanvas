 Is adding a FileNameExtensionFilter to the JFileChooser for only .txt files valid?

  If you want to do that on a private copy of the code that you don't turn in, sure.  But I'd rather not have that restriction made on what you do turn in -- if only to have to avoid a round of regrade requests when a human grader gets confused about why your game works differently than all the others.  :)
