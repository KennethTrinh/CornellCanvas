 For the if conditions
 <code>
  if (w is not in S or F)
 </code>
 I know how to check if w is in S, but I am confused on how to check if w is in F since the heap implementation does not have a get function. Any advice is appreciated!

 <p>
  you do NOT have to check whether s is in S by itself.
 </p>
 <p>
  You have two data structures: heap F and a HashMap.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you have clearly and precisely written the definition of the HashMap as a comment on its declaration, then you know what is in the HashMap.
