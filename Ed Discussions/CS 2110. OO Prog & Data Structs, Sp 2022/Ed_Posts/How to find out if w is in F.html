  For the if conditions
  <code>
   if (w is not in S or F)
  </code>
  I know how to check if w is in S, but I am confused on how to check if w is in F since the heap implementation does not have a get function. Any advice is appreciated!

  you do NOT have to check whether s is in S by itself.

  You have two data structures: heap F and a HashMap.

  If you have clearly and precisely written the definition of the HashMap as a comment on its declaration, then you know what is in the HashMap.
