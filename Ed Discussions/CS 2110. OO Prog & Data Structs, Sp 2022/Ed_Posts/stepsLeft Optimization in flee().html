  Since stepsLeft() depends on the moveTo() method, how can we approximate steps left in flee() when optimizing? I went through the starter code but couldn't find a specific answer

  The number of steps it takes moveTO to move from node n1 to n2 is the weight of the edge (n1, n2).

  If that edge is e, then the number of steps is e.length.
