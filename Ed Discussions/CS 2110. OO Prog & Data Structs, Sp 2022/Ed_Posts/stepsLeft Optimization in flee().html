 Since stepsLeft() depends on the moveTo() method, how can we approximate steps left in flee() when optimizing? I went through the starter code but couldn't find a specific answer

  The number of steps it takes moveTO to move from node n1 to n2 is the weight of the edge (n1, n2).
 </p>
 <p>
  If that edge is e, then the number of steps is e.length.
