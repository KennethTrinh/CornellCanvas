 I'm confused why we don't just declare them as CovidTree, but use var?
</p>
<p>
 I understand that var is like not specifying the type right now and let the computer decide. But since we do want a CovidTree, why not just say so?

  You could write the actual type, but var just makes declaring types easier because you don't have to type as much. Read the second page of
  <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/JavaAndDS/files/variableLocal.pdf">
   this

  pdf from the JHT. It tells you a lot about var.
