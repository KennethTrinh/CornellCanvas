 I am confused on the wording of the comment bloc in equals().  It says "this method is going to call equals" but I am not sure if this means within the equals() method or the helper isInSet().

  isInSet() will call equals() and equals() will also call isInSet(). Mutual recursion :)

   Do what you think is right. You should be able to figure out what is right.

   Blindly following instructions without understanding is not a good thing.
