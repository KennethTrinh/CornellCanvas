 From my understanding of graphs I believe it is considered to be planar if no edges cross and it does not contain subgraphs of K5 or K3,3. I would appreciate some clarification the best method to determine the planarity of a graph such as this and how to go from the first image to the second? Thank you!

  Yes, you do not understand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Type "planar" into JavaHyperText Filter Field and you see the definition:
 </p>
 <p>
  DEFINITION. A Graph is planar if it can be drawn in the plane with no edges crossing.
 </p>
 <p>
  As you can see from the answer, the edges of the graph above can be redrawn so that no edges cross. Study the two graphs, look at node G at the edges leaving it.
 </p>
 <p>
  You have to separate the definition, given above, from a proof about how to tell whether a graph is planar.
 </p>
 <p>
  Someone proved that a graph is planar, then it does not contain subgraphs of K5 or K3,3.
