  When declaring a variable before assigning a value to it, is this in any different to the space complexity than just declaring/initializing all at once? I understand sometimes you would declare a variable before assigning to it, just curious if there's any difference behind the scenes.

  So does this have any difference:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  int x;
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  x = 10;
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  VS
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  int x = 10;
 </paragraph>

  No difference, or if there is one, it is so small that you should never be concerned with it.
