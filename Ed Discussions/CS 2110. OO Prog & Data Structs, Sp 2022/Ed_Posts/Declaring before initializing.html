 When declaring a variable before assigning a value to it, is this in any different to the space complexity than just declaring/initializing all at once? I understand sometimes you would declare a variable before assigning to it, just curious if there's any difference behind the scenes.

<p>
 So does this have any difference:
</p>
<p>
 int x;
</p>
<p>
 x = 10;
</p>
<p>
 VS
</p>
<p>
 int x = 10;
</p>

  No difference, or if there is one, it is so small that you should never be concerned with it.
