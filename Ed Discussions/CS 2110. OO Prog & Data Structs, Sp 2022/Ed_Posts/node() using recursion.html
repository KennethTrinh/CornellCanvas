 Are we allowed to use recursion when writing the method node() ? Or would we get points off? Are we also allowed to call other methods such as delete() ?

  Do not use recursion. It is not need and is far to wasteful in time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Use only loops.
 </p>
 <p>
  You can call other methods, but why would you want to delete anything?

  Method node() should not change the list at all.
