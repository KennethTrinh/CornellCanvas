  When we add p as an advisor, p also gets an advisee so we need to increment the advisees field of object p. But advisees is a private field. We have a method that returns the value of advisees so I guess I could use that as a getter. Should I write a setter for the advisees field too? Because p.advisees = p.advisees() + 1; won't work unless I have a setter.

  You are allowed to access private fields within the same class, so since p is an object of PhD and youâ€™re in the PhD class you can directly access the private field advisees of the object p.

  Do not use the getter method. Do not write a setter method.

  You don't fully understand "private". A method in a class can access the private fields of ANY object of that class. Try p.advisees = p.advisees() + 1;  See what happens.
