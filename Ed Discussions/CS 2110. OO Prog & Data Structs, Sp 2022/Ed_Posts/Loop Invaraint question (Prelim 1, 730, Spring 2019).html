  h is to the left of the line the precondition must satisfy that b[h+1...m] is the unknown region and in the precondition we want the whole array to be unknown so we want m = b.length-1 and h+1=0 so h=-1 to satisfy that b[0...b.length-1] is all unknown
 </p>
 <p>
  We also know that b[m+1..t] must be the OSX segment so initially we want it empty so if m = b.length-1 and we want it empty so to make b[b.length...t] empty we make t be one less than the tail so t = b.length-1
 </p>

   If that's the case, why would this problem (from Spring 2019 5:30) has h=0 and t=b.length, not h=-1 and t=b.length-1, for initialization? I thought the logic for these two are the same.

    Here h is to the right of the line not left which is why it's 0 not -1.
   </p>
   <p>
    <break>
    </break>
    so b[0..h-1] must be empty so by our handy rule! we know
   </p>
   <p>
    h-1 +1 - 0 = 0 so h = 0
   </p>
   <p>
    b[h...m-1] must be empty, again:
   </p>
   <p>
    m-1+1 -h = 0
   </p>
   <p>
    m = h (we know h = 0, so both works)
   </p>
   <p>
    b[m...t-1] is the whole array and we know m = 0 so b[0...t-1] is whole length of whole array
   </p>
   <p>
    t-1+1 - 0 = b.length
   </p>
   <p>
    t = b.length, we can also use visual inspection and see for b[0...t-1] to be whole array t must be b.length
   </p>
   <p>
    <break>
    </break>
    let me know if anything's confusing!
   </p>
