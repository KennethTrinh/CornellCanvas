  From my understanding, Double Hashing has formula ( i = ( h1(key)+c*h2(key) ) % size of the array ) to calculate the index where c is the number of collisions so if there are zero collisions then h2 is not used, but if there are collisions then h2 is used to form the index. But what if even after this process you still have a collision?
