  I'm confused. Do the three folders on the Right represent three objects of class int[][] and int[]? When you mentioned that an array is an object, does "array" refer to variables like e which contains pointers to those arrays of elements, or the arrays of elements themselves? And based on our convention, int[][] and int[] are class names. Is that really the case? Or is it just an abuse of notation?

  1. Yes, the folders all represent objects of either int[][] or int[].

  2. You should consider an "array" to be an object, whose behavior is just like any other object; it is located in some place in memory, where the variable allows us to access it in its place in memory. An array is not solely the variable
  <code>
   e
  </code>
  itself, nor is simply the elements contained within the array, because we can also do things like
  <code>
   e.length
  </code>
  which is a field of the object.

  3. int[][] and int[] are indeed class names, but they're defined by Java in a special way, so that we can add more brackets if we want more dimensions, thereby making them extensible.
