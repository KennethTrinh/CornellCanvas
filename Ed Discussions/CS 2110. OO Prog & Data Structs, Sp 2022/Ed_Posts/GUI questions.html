  Hello!
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I was looking through the past prelims, and most of them only have GUIs as short answer questions. I was wondering if we can expect the same in the prelim or will be asked to write GUI code?

  I had the same question above. I think most of us have already read the study guide and wanted more clarification than just a screenshot if possible.

  I wanted to know if this semester's GUI questions will be similar to previous prelims or if there will be new types of questions. Thanks!
