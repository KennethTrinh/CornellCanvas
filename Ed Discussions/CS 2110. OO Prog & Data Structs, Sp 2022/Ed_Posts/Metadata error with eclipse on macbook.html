  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I was working my the A1 assignment,  but my eclipse glitched and keeps giving me a metadata error that I'm not sure on how to fix. I asked a TA twice but he told me he isn't sure of what to do because none of the TAs have macbooks. Is there anyone that can help me? Thanks!

  Try this.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  In Eclipse, start a different workspace and switch to it.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Then start A1 anew in that new workspace and copy the .java files into it from the old workspace.

  When i click the eclipse app to try to do that, it automatically gives me a metadata error.

  Your are going to have to see someone in person (or zoom) to help solve this error. We can't help without seeing things carefully
