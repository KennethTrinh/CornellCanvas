  I'm a bit unsure of what the expectation is for this section of the final:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  "Rigorous arguments for establishing the big-O complexity of algorithms. Be prepared to show that an algorithm is correct through clear and logical reasoning"
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Would we be proving the big-O complexity of algorithms or the correctness of algorithms or both? For correctness, I'd assume we would use the 4 loopy questions, but for big-O complexity would explaining it be enough?

  2. Given an algorithm, perhaps with loops, tell us its O(...) complexity.
