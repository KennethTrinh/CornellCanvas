 I'm a bit unsure of what the expectation is for this section of the final:
</p>
<p>
 "Rigorous arguments for establishing the big-O complexity of algorithms. Be prepared to show that an algorithm is correct through clear and logical reasoning"
</p>
<p>
 Would we be proving the big-O complexity of algorithms or the correctness of algorithms or both? For correctness, I'd assume we would use the 4 loopy questions, but for big-O complexity would explaining it be enough?
</p>

  1. How to prove that f(n) is in O(g(n)).  As taught in class and discussed in JavaHyperText.
 </p>
 <p>
  2. Given an algorithm, perhaps with loops, tell us its O(...) complexity.
