 in the description for the isSiblingOf method, it says you have to check whether this object and p are the same object.  Should this be a precondition of using the method, or should the method just return false if the object and p are the same?

  Let us reason this together. The spec says:
 </p>
 <p>
  Return value of: "this PhD is an intellectual sibling of p".
 </p>
 <p>
  Put in the definition of "intellectual sibling":
 </p>
 <p>
  Return the value of: "(1) this PhD and p are not the same object and
  <break>
  </break>
  (2) this PhD and p have a non-null advisor in common"
 </p>
 <p>
  If you have to return the value of something of the form  "b and c", well, write a return statement that does that. Why does the notion of Precondition enter into it?

   Specifications will explicitly say "Precondition" for preconditions. If it doesn't say "Precondition" in the specification before that part, then it shouldn't be considered a precondition. The specifications in assignments will have the preconditions listed at the end of the specification
