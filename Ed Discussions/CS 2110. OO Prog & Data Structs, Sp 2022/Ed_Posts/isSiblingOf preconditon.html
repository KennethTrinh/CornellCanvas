  in the description for the isSiblingOf method, it says you have to check whether this object and p are the same object.  Should this be a precondition of using the method, or should the method just return false if the object and p are the same?

  Specifications will explicitly say "Precondition" for preconditions. If it doesn't say "Precondition" in the specification before that part, then it shouldn't be considered a precondition. The specifications in assignments will have the preconditions listed at the end of the specification

  Let us reason this together. The spec says:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Return value of: "this PhD is an intellectual sibling of p".
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Put in the definition of "intellectual sibling":
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Return the value of: "(1) this PhD and p are not the same object and
  <break>
  </break>
  (2) this PhD and p have a non-null advisor in common"
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If you have to return the value of something of the form  "b and c", well, write a return statement that does that. Why does the notion of Precondition enter into it?
