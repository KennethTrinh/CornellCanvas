 Hi, I don't understand why k&lt; s.length is executed m+1 times ( i think that include m times ture, and 1 time false) , but s.charAt(k) == 'c' can be executed m+1 times. Thank you!

  Suppose s[2] is the first occurrence of c and that s.length() &gt; 2. Then from the photo you posted, k &lt; s.length() is executed 3 times and s.charAt(k) == 'c' is also executed 3 times.
 </p>
 <p>
  Let's run through the loop to test this. The first iteration runs with k = 0 (k &lt; s.length() execution 1). We execute the comparison with c, but we don't find it yet as s[0] is not c (s.charAt(k) == 'c' execution 1). We do the same with the next iteration with k = 1. We have: k &lt; s.length() execution 2 and s.charAt(k) == 'c' execution 2. We don't find c in this iteration either because s[1] is not c. We run the next iteration. We execute k &lt; s.length() for the third time and increment with k so that k = 2. We then execute s.charAt(k) == 'c' a third time. This time, we find c, because s[2] is the first occurrence of c. Based on the body of the if statement, we then return k. This means that we do not continue to the next iteration.

  We have executed k &lt; s.length() 3 times and s.charAt(k) == 'c' 3 times. Hope this example helps!
