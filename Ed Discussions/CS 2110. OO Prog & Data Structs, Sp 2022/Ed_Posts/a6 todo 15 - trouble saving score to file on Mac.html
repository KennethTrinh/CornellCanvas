  Hi, I'm having trouble appending the score to the chosen file's content in todo 15.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I was told by TA that there seemed to be nothing wrong with my code, so it could be something to do with Mac's permission to access and modify files.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Just wondering if there's anyone else who has run into this issue...

  I am looking into this. I do not think it is Mac permission issue anymore. I  spotted what is wrong and response to your email.
