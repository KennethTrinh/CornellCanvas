  When I upload my folder that I downloaded from canvas, it doesn't seem to be registering with Eclipse/this workspace. How do I fix so Eclipse recognizes it?

  Not sure how to fix this without creating projects and JUNIT test cases and then manually copying and pasting the code into the new folders.

  Do you have a folder inside your project (appearing in the package explorer) labeled "JUnit 5"?

  It appears that it may be having issues because the default package (where A2.java should be housed) is not under the src folder. Additionally, the A2Test.Java is not under a JUNIT 5 folder.

  I didn’t mean I’d it under a JUnit 5 folder. I meant is there a JUnit 5 folder inside the project itself (A2Skeleton)

  Ok for the test file I think it's most likely you need to enable the JUnit library. Create a JUnit test file and see if that makes the errors go away in A2Test. Can you hover over the errors to show what it is? What message are you getting in A2.java?

  This does not appear to help because it cannot have the same name and I would have to copy the code
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Here are some of the errors:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The method assertEquals(int, int) is undefined for the type A2Test
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The import org.junit cannot be resolved

  Creating JUnit test case would just prompt you to import JUnit5. You wouldn’t need to copy anything over. Just make another random one called “random” or something and it’ll prompt you to add JUnit.

  To solve I just did it manually... but this doesnt feel like best solution
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I renamed the original test case to A2Tests and then made a JUNIT test case called A2Test and then copied and pasted the code and then deleted A2Tests

  Well, glad it works! I’m not sure why it did that in the first place. But if it’s working now that’s fine, since you’re just submitting the A2.java file anyway. If you really want to know what went wrong this is probably better a consultant/office hours question.
