 Will there be complexity on Prelim 1? It says "NOT ON PRELIM 1!" on the Study guide but then proceeds to say:
</p>
<p>
 "Know the definition of f is in O(g).  Be able to prove simple  theorems like n*n + 2 is O(n*n). Be able to look at a simple program and determine its order of execution. Know the basic complexity categories, e.g. O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n^2), O(n^3), ..., O(2^n). "
</p>
<p>
 Just a little confused and wondering if complexity will or will not appear. Thanks!

  If it says "NOT ON PRELIM!" then it is not on the prelim.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether it is on or not depends on when the prelim is scheduled. Wd don't want to remove that one paragraph about it because we mayweed it the next semester. But
 </p>
 <p>
  "NOT ON PRELIM!"
 </p>
 <p>
  says it all.
