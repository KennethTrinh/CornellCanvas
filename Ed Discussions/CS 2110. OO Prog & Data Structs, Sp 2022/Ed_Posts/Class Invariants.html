  If a field can contain any value of its type, do we need to state this fact in our Javadoc class invariant?

  The given descriptions in the handout are a good indication of what kind of information should be in a class invariant in general. You can use those descriptions as your class invariant for this assignment.

  So just to be sure, the descriptions that you're referring to are listed at the beginning of step 2, and we can copy them verbatim? For example, one line of that section reads "(Type int). Year the PhD was awarded. Can be any integer."
