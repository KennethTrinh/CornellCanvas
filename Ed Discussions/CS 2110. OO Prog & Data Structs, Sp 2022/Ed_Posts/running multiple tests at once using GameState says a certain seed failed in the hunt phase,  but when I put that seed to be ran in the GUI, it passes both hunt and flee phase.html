 Title: running multiple tests at once using GameState says a certain seed failed in the hunt phase,  but when I put that seed to be ran in the GUI, it passes both hunt and flee phase.

 Do I take the gamestate output as the true one?
</p>
<p>
 "Your solution to hunt returned at the wrong location."
</p>
<p>
 i'm running 50 tests in gamestate and it says it failed on multiple (the majority actually), but when I put them in the gui run configuration they pass and the console outputs seed, gold collected, bonus multiplier, and score as it does when there isn't an error.
</p>
<p>
 Edit: I found that when I enter the seeds that fail into
 <i>
  gamestate
 </i>
 configuration to be ran individually, it passes. It appears that if I run them as a batch most of them fail, but when ran individually (the same seed), they pass. Are the batch tests all supposed to pass?
</p>
<p>
 EDIT:
 <b>
  was because I had static fields.

  if you have a data structure that keeps track of something in a recursive  helper method and you want it to remember stuff, add a parameter to your helper method that will take in the data structure

  Do you have a static field that changes
 </p>
 <p>
  That can cause a problem when maps are run concurrently.

  You were warned against this,
