  I'm not sure this is just an issue for me, but for question starting like: "Given the following class hierarchy:" , I think there is supposed to be an image but there is only the link: &lt;img src="https://canvas.cornell.edu/assessment_questions/470632/files/2144117/download?verifier=XbUsRw5CpvhnnetS9a6hrznzcw6kRy61tcxsqXWO" alt="Animal &lt;-- Dog &lt;-- Corgi" width="107" height="261"&gt;.

  Is this an error in the quiz?

  I used the alt which is the description of what the image contains. Just by reading the names and the direction of arrows you should be able to tell how the class is structured. Though I hope the image is fixed soon.

  The quiz says what is given below. Are you using Safari?

   Mac users must not use Safari because of a known Canvas bug with embedded images. Use Chrome instead.

  Verify that you can see the picture below before starting this quiz.

  I have the same problem too. I was using Chrome. I saw the picture black lives matter; still, I saw a broken image for the class hierarchy.
