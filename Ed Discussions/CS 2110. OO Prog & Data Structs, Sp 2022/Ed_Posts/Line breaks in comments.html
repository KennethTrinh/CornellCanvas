  For writing comments on how we felt about the assignment at the top of the PhD.java file, do we need to insert &lt;br&gt; in our comments? Or is just pressing return/enter wherever we want a new line okay?

  For Javadoc comments, you should use &lt;br&gt;. For other multiline comments, you can't use that tag to break the line, so it's ok if those go a bit over the 80 character limit.

  The spec document says to copy and paste this into the top of our .java file:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  /** NetId: nnnnn, nnnnn. Time spent: hh hours, mm minutes. &lt;br&gt;
  <break>
  </break>
  * What I thought about this assignment: &lt;br&gt;
  <break>
  </break>
  * Replace this with your comment, using as many lines as you want. */
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  On the third line, where it says "replace this with your comment," it looks like that part is a Javadoc comment. So should we use &lt;br&gt; here or not? I'm a bit confused.

  This is a javadoc comment and it already includes &lt;br&gt; so yes, you can use &lt;br&gt; here.

  Am I absolutely required to use &lt;br&gt; though? Or is it ok to just press enter?

  You should learn to use &lt;br&gt; to make your javadoc comments as readable as possible. For example, it is always best to have Preconditions on a separate line, so put &lt;br&gt; just before it.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Don't ask "am I absolutely required to ...".
  <break>
  </break>
  Instead, ask "What are best practices? I want to learn as much as possible about good professional programming."
  <break>
  </break>
  You are here to learn, not simply to get a grade.

  You are not required to use it, but if you just press enter, the formatting may place some of the comment past the 80 character limit, so we suggest you use it.
