 For A3, if a method doesn't specify whether we should/ shouldn't use for loops, can we assume that it is okay to use? For example, I am thinking of using a for loop for surroundLittles(), but I'm unsure if that's the approach the assignment is looking for.

  You can use a while loop or a for loop. Use which one YOU think is best for each situation.
