  Should we just open the A2 files in Eclipse and edit them there or should we create a package, class, etc. and copy and paste the code into those.

  You can't jut open the files in Eclipse because they wouldn't be in your workspace so you won't be able to run the test file. You should create a java project inside your workspace, and create classes using those two files given to you in the A2Skeleton

  Would I do that by copy and pasting the text in the files into classes I create?  Or is there a way I should import them?

  I noticed there is no main class in A2.java. Do we need to add that or will it work correctly as is?

  You are not going to execute a main program.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  You are going to test the methods using the JUnit testing class, just as you did in assignment A1. So there is no need for method main.
