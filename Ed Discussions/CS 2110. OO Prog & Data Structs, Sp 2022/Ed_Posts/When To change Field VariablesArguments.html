  In addAdvisor1 should we set our firstAdvisor variable to p and then change firstAdvisor.attendees +1 or should we alter the argument's attendees attribute and then set our field variable to the changed argument?

  We can't really answer this directly, but you should be writing your code to keep the class invariant true. This means updating all fields properly so that their specifications hold true.
