  Question 6 Part d from 2019 spring exam 7:30pm had this DFS question. If this was a BFS question, what would be different with the code? Would you just replace the word stack with queue or would there actually be differences in the code?

  Node f = queue.removeFirst()
  <break>
  </break>
  and instead of stack call it queue (just so it looks better)
