 Looking for a clarification on how the initialization not make the invariant true if 1=product of m..m and m&lt;=m&lt;=n is true when int z=1 and int k=m? The video example explaining this with the example of sum seems similar, but is there a key difference I am missing between the two examples?

  I notice now the exam question is missing a +1 in the precondition and a -1 in the invariant, but would still appreciate an explanation on how this affects the loop, thank you.

  In the first part, we have: z=1, k=m. By the invariant: z = product of m..k and m &lt;= k &lt;= n. Because we initialize k=m, the invariant begins as z = product of m..m, which is one element (not empty). However, the product of one element is whatever the element is (not necessarily 1). For example, if element m was 5, the product of m..m is 5.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the other case, we say z is the sum of m..k-1. We initialize k=m, so z is originally the sum of m..m-1. The sum of an empty set is 0 so our initialization of k and z satisfies the invariant.
