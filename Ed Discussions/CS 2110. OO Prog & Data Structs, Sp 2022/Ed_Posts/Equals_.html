 On a prelim, one question is "If b and c are objects of class A and class A has not overridden equals, then b.equals(c) will evaluate to true if and only if the values of every field in b and c are equal." The answer to this is false, but I thought this is what the method equals() does.

  No if class A doesn't override equals it uses the default equals method from Class Object which is the same as == so if you do b==c it would return false since they are different objects (but of the same class)
