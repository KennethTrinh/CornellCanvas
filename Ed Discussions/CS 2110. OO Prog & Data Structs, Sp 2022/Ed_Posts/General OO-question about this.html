  If the parameter is the same name as the field name you use this.field = parameter to differentiate it to java, because it searches from bottom up sees the first x as the parameter, so if you don't use keyword 'this' it doesn't know that you're referring to the field.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  so let's say we had
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  public class C{
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  privant int x;
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  public void C(x){
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  this.x  = x ;
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  //this.x refers to the private int field x
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  // x refers to the parameter x
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <break>
  </break>
  } }
 </paragraph>
