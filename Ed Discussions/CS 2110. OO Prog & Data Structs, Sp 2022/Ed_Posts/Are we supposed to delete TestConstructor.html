 It says we should not have a testing procedure for tostringrev. So, are we supposed to delete the copy pasted TestConstructor or should we keep that in before the Append+toStringRev test function?

  Why would you delete it? You want to make sure that it works.

  Write your own testing procedure to test Append+toStringRev.
