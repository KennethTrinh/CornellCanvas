  This note has to do with calling one constructor from another, for example, in A1, calling the first constructor from the second constructor.
  <break>
  </break>
  You don't have to read further if you are not calling one constructor from another.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  <bold>
   Rule
  </bold>
  : Within a constructor, a call on another constructor
  <break>
  </break>
  cannot appear in any place except as the first statement.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  This means that if you decide to have constructor 2 call constructor 1, the assert
  <break>
  </break>
  statements for Preconditions cannot be at the beginning of constructor 2;
  <break>
  </break>
  they must come after that call of constructor 1.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  That is OK.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  HOWEVER! Note that that if a call on constructor 1 does some assert-checking of Preconditions,
  <break>
  </break>
  you don't have to repeat them in the rest of constructor 2.
