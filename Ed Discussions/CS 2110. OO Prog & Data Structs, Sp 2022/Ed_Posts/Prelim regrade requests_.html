  In the email about grades it says there is an announcement on Ed Discussions we should read before submitting regrade requests, when will that be posted? Also some comments on Gradescope say "see our solution," where do we find that?

  The announcement was mistakenly posted in the old Ed discussion board. I'm contacting Professor Gries about it
