  what underline sentence means here? the ==n and ||? I thought the later part that already compares and can make uc= h/h+1 that has a larger b[n]value?

  This statement has a conditional expression. Let me parenthesize it:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  int uc=  (h+1==n || b[h] &gt; b[h+1)  ?  h  :  h+1);
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Now, we know that h &lt; n. That means that the left child of k exists. Three cases arise:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1. h+1 = n. Then, k has only ONE left child in the heap. So n is bigger one and h is stored in uk.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. h+1 &lt; n. Aah. k has two children in the heap. The bigger one must be stored in uc.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2A. b[h] &gt; b[h+1]. So b[h] is bigger, and h is stored in uc.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2B. b[h] &lt;= b[h+1]. So b[h+1] is bigger, and h+1 is stored in uc.

  thank you for the explanation! but why when h+1=n, k has only one left child? h is left child, isn't h+1 the right one?
