 When looking over the grading for A1, I got points deducted for not having the proper preferences installed. But when looking over the formatting page on Canvas, I had the correct 18 save actions installed? Are there other preferences that need to be installed besides the save actions?

  Did the feedback give any indication of what was. not formatted properly, for example, unnecessary parentheses not removed?

   Yes there is a preference file you need to install that is referenced in the formatting preferences page on canvas. If you need help setting those up, you can attend office hours and the TA can help you
