 In the demo for lecture 18 in the class AdjListGraph, the method, hasVertex(), which I have pasted below, uses a foreach loop, but the class that it is in, AdjListGraph, does not implement the interface Iterable. I thought foreach loops can only be used if Iterable is implemented. How does this method in the lecture demo work then?
</p>
<p>
 public boolean hasVertex(VL v) {
</p>
<p>
 for (Vertex u : vertices) {
</p>
<p>
 if (u.label.equals(v)) return true;
</p>
<p>
 }
</p>
<p>
 return false;
</p>
<p>
 }
</p>

  Adjacency Lists are represented by the List interface, which are implemented by ArrayLists or LinkedLists, as seen in lecture. I believe these classes are automatically Iterable, so you don't need to manually implement Iterable/Iterator every time you want to use a for-each loop. You only need to do it yourself when it's not one of the classes imported from Java that do this already.
