 Hello!
</p>
<p>
 I was a little confused about what the name of an object is. Is it the class name @ the memory address or am I missing something?

  Essentially, yes, the name of an object can be thought of as
  <code>
   CLASS_NAME@MEMORY_ADDRESS
  </code>
  . Of course, it's just an abstraction we use in CS 2110 along with the "manila folder" for what an object really is - just a specific set of bits in a specific memory address. And note that we distinguish different objects of the same class by denoting them with different memory addresses.
