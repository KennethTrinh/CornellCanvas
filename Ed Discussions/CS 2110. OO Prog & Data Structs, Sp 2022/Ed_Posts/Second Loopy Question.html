<pre>Second loopy question: Does it stop right: Does P &amp;&amp; !B imply R? 
The loop must end with R true. </pre>
<p>
 Is a good way of solving the second loopy question making invariant P look like R? and utilize that information to get !B then B?
</p>

 <p>
  Yes, that's exactly how to answer the second loopy question and write the loop condition.
