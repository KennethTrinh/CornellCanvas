  Currently two of the tests are failing with errors like this one
  <code>
   java.lang.AssertionError: expected:&lt;76&gt; but was:&lt;90&gt;
  </code>
  . I followed the abstract algorithm and tried going through my own examples, but I am confused what could be going wrong. Is there any particular place in the algorithm I should double check that could be causing the shortest distance to be incorrect?

  If it's the last two test cases failing then you likely forgot to change priority in the heap in your last if statement.
