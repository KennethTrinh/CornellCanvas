 When the game is inactive, the sliders are supposed to work right? Like if I havenâ€™t started a game and I increase the target size and speed, when I start the game, it should have updated? Thank you

  Yes.  I think the video I created demoed that in fact.  Apologies if it did not.

   I think it makes more sense for the sliders to work whether the game is running or not. Otherwise, you may start the game and have sliders that are already deformed which might limit or extend the intended constraints on the slider. Also if the button/slider has already appeared to the user, I feel like it should do something, otherwise it could be confusing.

   Just my 2 cents.
