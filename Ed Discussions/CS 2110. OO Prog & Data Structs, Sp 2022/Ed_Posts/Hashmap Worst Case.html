 In lecture today we learned that the expected time complexity for the get method for a hashmap is O(1) but worst case it is linear.
</p>
<p>
 What case would make it linear? When there are multiple instances of the same value?

  Sorry. This is not your concern at this moment. We can't explain it now.
 </p>
 <p>
  You have to wait until we discuss hashing and hash tables.
