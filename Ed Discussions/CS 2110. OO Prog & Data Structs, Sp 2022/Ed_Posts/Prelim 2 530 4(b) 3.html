  I personally believe that the complexity of ln.add(i, e) should be O(min(i, n-i)).

  As I notice from

  "All of the operations perform as could be expected for a doubly-linked list. Operations that index into the list will traverse the list from the beginning or the end, whichever is closer to the specified index."

  In our LinkedList assignment, it would certainly be O(min(i, n-i)). But there was an Ed post where the answerer said linked list refers to a singly linked list.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  However, this question specifically refers to the Java API LinkedList, so for accuracy we have to see what the Java API Documentation says. It says, that the traversal will be done the shorter way, from beginning or the end. Therefore, the answer O(min(i, n-i)) is correct!

  Thanks for point this out.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  We will change this question on the prelim to accept either  O(i) or O(min(i, n-i)). This will take a bit of time to do.
