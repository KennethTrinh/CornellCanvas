  Because we are unable to access/instantiate the private innerclass Node...

 <paragraph>
  to test that head and tail are correct, we must save their memory location to a String with head(), or tail()...
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Do we need to do this or is this overkill?

  Testing it directly is overkill, your tostring and the method that checks for the string reverse ( i think tostringrev) should access the head and tail (which in turn tests for the head and tail but indirectly)
