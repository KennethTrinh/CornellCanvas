  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Why is the call to bubbleDown not bubbleDown(b, 0) after you swap values in position 0 and k in b? I thought since b[0..k] is the maxHeap, b[0] is not the right value, so if you bubble it down, it will be a Max heap again.

  You want it to be a max-heap!
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Note the k= k-1;  between the swap and the bubbledown.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  It starts with b[0..k] a heap;
  <break>
  </break>
  Swaps the largest value into b[k],
  <break>
  </break>
  Subtracts 1 from k so that that b[0..k] now refers to
  <break>
  </break>
  a heap (almost) that has one less value; and
  <break>
  </break>
  Bubbles down, making it into a heap.
