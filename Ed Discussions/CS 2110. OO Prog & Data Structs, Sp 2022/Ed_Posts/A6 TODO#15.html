 For todo 15, I am confused about how to create a file that has the score in it. When I read the instruction pdf for A6 I saw this code.
</p>
<p>
 try (PrintWriter out= new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(file, true)))) {
</p>
<p>
 // Write data to file with 'out.println()'
</p>
<p>
 } catch (IOException e) { // Handle exception `e`
</p>
<p>
 }
</p>
<p>
 I am also not sure what is the use for this code. Is it for to save the score in the file or for the error message?
</p>

  The try block is to save your score into the file using 'out.println()'. Your next step is to find out what you need to print.
  <break>
  </break>
  The catch block is for your error, specifically when the file you are trying to save your score to is read-only. The specification will instruct you on how to show the error message window.
