  For todo 15, I am confused about how to create a file that has the score in it. When I read the instruction pdf for A6 I saw this code.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  try (PrintWriter out= new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(file, true)))) {
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  // Write data to file with 'out.println()'
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  } catch (IOException e) { // Handle exception `e`
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  }
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I am also not sure what is the use for this code. Is it for to save the score in the file or for the error message?

  The try block is to save your score into the file using 'out.println()'. Your next step is to find out what you need to print.
  <break>
  </break>
  The catch block is for your error, specifically when the file you are trying to save your score to is read-only. The specification will instruct you on how to show the error message window.
