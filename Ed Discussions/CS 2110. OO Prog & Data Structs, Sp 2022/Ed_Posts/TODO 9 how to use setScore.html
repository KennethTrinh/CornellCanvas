 From previous ed posts I realized we must use setScore for todo 9 but when I try to use it, we are not able since it is a private class. Therefore by only using getScore in my anonymous function my score label remains at zero.

  You could refer to #1552

  You are correct that setScore() is a private method in GameComponent.java, so you won't have to use it for TODO 9.

  The JLabel class has a method called setText() that allows you to change the String for the scoreLabel object. Use that method along with getScore() in the anonymous function to update the score.
