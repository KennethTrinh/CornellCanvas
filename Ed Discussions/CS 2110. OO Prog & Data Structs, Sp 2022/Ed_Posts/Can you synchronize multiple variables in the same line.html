  the sample code for deadlock in the java hypertext synchronizes variables separately and leads to a deadlock. Is it possible have something like "synchronized (DdLck.a, DdLck.b)" to prevent the deadlock from happening? If not how else could you prevent deadlock.

  Here's part of the code.

 <pre>class P1 extends Thread {
     public void run() {
         synchronized (DdLck.a) {
         System.out.println("P1 has a");
         synchronized (DdLck.b) {
         }
       }
       System.out.println("P1 finished");
     }
}
</pre>

  You can do it with multiple variables but just in different blocks, you can't have 2 people in the potty hole at the same time is our analogy
