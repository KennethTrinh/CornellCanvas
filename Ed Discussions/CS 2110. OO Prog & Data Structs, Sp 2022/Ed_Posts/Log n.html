 What exactly does a method having a time proportional to log n mean? Does it mean that when the method is called log n call frames are created?
</p>
<p>
 The powFast method in the complexity lecture has time proportional to log n. Thus does that mean a call of powFast(b^19) would take time log(19) or only make a little bit more than 1 call frame? I am confused because there are clearly multiple recursive calls.

  In this example, yes, about log n frames for calls will be placed on the call stack --actually it may be up to 2 * log n.
 </p>
 <p>
  Execute this call yourself and figure out how many frames for calls will be placed on the stack:
  <break>
  </break>
  powFast( 2, 32)
 </p>

   Aren’t there call frames created for each call which would exceed the value of log(32) ?
  </p>
  <p>
   I diagrammed out the call frames for the call powFast(2,32) and I had 7 call frames on the call stack.
