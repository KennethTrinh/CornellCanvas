 Underneath the heading for Writing gotBefore it says that it needs 9 test cases. Does this mean gotBefore has 9 test cases or that gotBefore and isSibiling have 9 test cases combined. Also, I currently have 5 test procedures, one for each constructor, one for mutators, and one for each function. Is this allowed? Just double checking.

  Yes as Bahaa said, only gotBefore has 9 test cases. Regarding test procedures. It's ok to have 5 test procedures. As long as you make it clear which methods you are testing.

   gotBefore has 9 test cases on its own. And at the end of the assignment it says you must have a total of 5 procedures, not more so you’d lose marks, so combine the methods from part D into one procedure, since you’ll need one more procedure for testing your asserts

    Hi Bahaa, thanks for your help.  I’m confused by what you mean by testing your asserts. How is testing your asserts different from testing the methods/constructors/mutator? Don’t you test the methods/constructors/mutator with assertEquals?

     testing your asserts means making sure your preconditions work/are correct

      In this assignment we ask you to assert that the preconditions are correct.  When we test those assert statements, we attempt to pass an argument that would violate the precondition and test that the assert statements throw an AssertionError when that precondition is violated.
     </p>

       Thanks for clarifying. Can we have the asserts at the start of the code itself (in the java file, not the test case file)? And then have 5 test cases in the test case file, one for each function/constructor/mutator?

        assert statements are supposed to be at the start of the methods that have preconditions. Your tests checking that those assert statements work must be in a testing procedure in the JUnit Test file.
