  In questions 3 and 4 of the heaps homework, do the "?" represent an empty spot in the array that we can fill or do they represent a null object? I am confused with if I am allowed to replace the "?" in the heap with the value I am told to add, or do I have to create a new position in the heap after the two "?" nodes to insert the value?

  Please read the whole assignment carefully. It will say that ? values are array elements that are NOT in the heap. That is all. That is the meaning of ?
