  We have to test the code for parts A, B, C, and D, and then for assert statements (where there will be around 25). Are there a certain amount of tests we are expected to hit for the other parts?

  Yes you should test everything. Don't worry about number of tests. Instead you should be making sure you test everything thoroughly.
