  I am reviewing Lecture #2 but came across a question where I'm not exactly sure why I'm wrong.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Does the field c.y change values because it's not a parameter in the method?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  How do I know that the value of field c.x is from the surrounding scope? Thank you in advance.

  So as you could also tell by the color of the variables, in method m, x is refers to the parameter, but  y  refers to the field from Class C

  When you execute at the assignment  x= k;  use the inside-out rule to determine the declaration associated with x and with k. In both cases, the inside-out rule tells you that the variable (x, k) refers to the parameter. Thus, this assignment just stores the value in parameter k into parameter x. Thus, after this assignment, both parameters contain 3.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Now, execute the second statement, c.y= x; . The inside-out rule tells you that x refers to parameter x, whose value is 3. The, the right hand side evaluates to 3. y refers to field y of c, since this method call is  c.m(3, 4). The assignment changes c.y to 3.
