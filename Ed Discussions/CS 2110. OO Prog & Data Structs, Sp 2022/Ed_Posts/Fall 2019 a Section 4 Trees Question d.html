  In the question below, I'm confused as to why the correct answer isn't O(k) and is rather O(min(m, k)). Wouldn't the traversal of the tree always be limited to O(k), no matter how large the tree is or how large its strings are? For instance, if k= "ithaca" and we tried to find that string in the tree given in the question, wouldn't the traversal start with i in the left branch and then move to n, and then stop the traversal of the tree right there? Thus, being based on k?

  Or, does the traversal stop once n strings of length m have been visited and the string found or not found? I may just be confused on how this algorithm works in the first place.
