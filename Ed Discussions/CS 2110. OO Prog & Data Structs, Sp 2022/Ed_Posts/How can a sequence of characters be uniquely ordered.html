 I don't get this hint, is it referring to things such as all the characters can be unique, there are multiple combinations of the same characters, etc?
</p>
<p>
 EDIT: What tripped me up originally was that I thought this function wanted to determine whether two strings were palindromes of one another. Got confused about how to do that without loops and the standard library since there is no reversed method built-in

    How can those characters be ordered such that no two orderings look the same?
