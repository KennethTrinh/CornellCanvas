 Hi, from my understanding of the binary search tree, I thought December should be the right-side-child of April, not a child of August as shown in the below lecture slide. I was thinking that December is "greater" than April in alphabetical order, so December would be the right subtree of April. Could you explain to me if my understanding is wrong? Thank you in advance!

  You are right that December belongs somewhere in the right subtree of April, but in this case, August is already the right child of April by the time that we add December (we add the months chronologically). Thus, we compare December to August and see that it should be the right child of August.

   Oh I see. For some reason, I thought August was labelled as April's left child. Thank you for your answer!
