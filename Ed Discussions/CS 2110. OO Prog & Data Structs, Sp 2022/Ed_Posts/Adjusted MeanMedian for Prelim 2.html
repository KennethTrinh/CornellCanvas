 I've noticed my grade change for Prelim 2 since the grades were first released and I heard that the rubric changed a little bit. I was wonder if/when we would get the new mean/median distribution of Prelim 2.

 Thank you!

  You will get that once regrades are done. It will be in CMS.

   You should also be able to see the statistics on gradescope.
