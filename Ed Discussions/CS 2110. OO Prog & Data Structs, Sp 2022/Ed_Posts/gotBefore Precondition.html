  I noticed that there is the precondition that p is not null for isSiblingOf but not for gotBefore. Should we check whether p is null in the method body rather than using assert for gotBefore? And  should we make test classes public? Thank you.

  Yes check in the method body for gotbefore , if it is null return false, for issiblingof it is a precondition so that needs an assertion.
