  I'm confused about adding to the front of the linkedlist in the CovidRouteTo(). I'm doing it like this: l.addFirst(human());
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  since addFirst is a linked list method, but then I am getting this output: [A,[ C, ]E]
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  How do I add to the front of the linked list correctly?

  Look at the API documentation for interface List to find a method that allows you to add a value anywhere, including at the front.

  But that may not be your real problem. We need to see code in a private thread.
