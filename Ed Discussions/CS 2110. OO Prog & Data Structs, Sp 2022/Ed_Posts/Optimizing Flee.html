  In order to optimize flee, we are trying to use this tip:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <bold>
   But you may want to change it or make a copy and alter the copy. For example, one version could find the shortest path to
   <italic>
    all
   </italic>
   nodes and return the HashMap that gives all the information.
  </bold>
 </paragraph>

  Our solution, we were thinking, would be to compare the amount of gold traversed through each of these paths (vs number of steps), and then choose a path accordingly in order to optimize. I am confused on how to access the gold in each of these paths, and whether or not we should store it in some sort of variable?

  You have access to all of the nodes on the map for flee with one of the methods provided.
  <break>
  </break>
  Given a node n, if n.getTile().gold()!=0 then the tile corresponding to the node has gold. You collect the gold by going on top of the tile.
  <break>
  </break>
  Storing things in variables is a personal matter and you can decide how you want to store data. There are many ways one can go about this. Some better than others.
