 Hi, for A1, if I have found my partner, can I invite her on CMS? I don't see A1 on CMS yet so I'm not sure how to send out the invitation. Also, it seems like SAROS for pair programming is not available yet according to canvas.

  I just made A1 available on the CMS. You can now invite your partner, and your partner has to accept the invitation. Then you are grouped.

  We are not doing anything with SAROS this semester. If you get it working, fine.

  You could instead zoom together and one person shares their screen and you chat as that one programs
