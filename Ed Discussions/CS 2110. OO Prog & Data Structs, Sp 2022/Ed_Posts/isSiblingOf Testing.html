  How do we know if we have good enough coverage of test cases for isSiblingOf? I can think of a ton of test cases but implementing every single one would be difficult, so how should I know when to stop?

  Three considerations --after looking carefully at the definition of sibling given in the handout.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1. Black box testing. Look at the ways two PhDs could be siblings. first advisor of one is the same as the second advisor of the other, etc. Put in test cases for each way. Also put in test cases where the answer is false.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. Transparent box testing: Look at the body of the method and write enough test cases that every way that expression could be true of false is tested.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  3. Are there extreme cases to check for?
