 When my find phase runs, it does not return when Martha gets to the orb. I'm not sure what went wrong since, during my dfs, I have a base case if statement to return when the distance to the orb is zero. When I tried putting a test print statement inside my if statement before the return it does get printed so it does reach that part of the code. What am I missing?

  We can't tell without see code.

  Put if in a private thread. And we need to see the method specification as well as the method.

  Did you follow the directions given for find in the pinned A8 note? If not, look at this directions before doing anything more on Ed Discussions.

   I looked at the directions in the pinned note, but I may be misunderstanding something. Also, when I changed my code to an if-else statement rather than just a base case if-statement, it deletes the return statement when I save my code. Should I still post it in a private thread or does that give you a clue as to what's going wrong?
