  can I write k=n; s=b[n] instead? and moreover why is the answer k=n+1;s=1; as it seems not truthifying the invariant: as s is the product of b[k..n] and if k=n+1, then s=product of b[n+1..n]=0, not 1.

  No, that means you know s is the product of all elements in the range b[n..n] which isn’t the precondition. And s=1 is because of something we discussed in class you set the initial sum value to 0 and the initial product value to 1, if you set it o 0 when you try multiplying any of the elements in the list by 0 you’ll get 0.

  To be more explicit, if segment b[m..n] is empty, referencing b[n] makes no sense, and the product of the empty segment is 1.
