 I don't know if I was the only one who had this problem, but my CMS did not show the Q2 Program Correctness Quiz until this morning. I saw the quiz on the 3 week plan, but I have been checking CMS everyday and it was never an option to take until this morning which is past the deadline. Is there any chance the quiz can be opened back up for submissions?
