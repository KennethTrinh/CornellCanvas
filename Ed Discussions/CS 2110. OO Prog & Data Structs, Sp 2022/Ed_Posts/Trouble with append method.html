  I'm having trouble adding to the end, I keep failing the test methods because it says that "Cannot read field 'next' because it is 'null'"
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  How do I add to the end of the list without using the tail of the linked list, and it has no values to start because the constructor is just empty, so I can't even assign it values.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Help woudl be appreciated

  If youâ€™re appending to an empty list then you assign both the head and the tail to the node.

  You need a specific case accounted for in a conditional for when there is nothing in the linked list and set the head and tail to that node.
