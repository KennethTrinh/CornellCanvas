  Hi! For constructor2, the assert statements and assignment statements for the name, year, and month are the same as for constructor1.  Should we call constructor1 before assigning only the advisors in constructor2, or rewrite and reassign the name, year, and month in constructor2?

  you can use the this() functionality where you can refer to the earlier constructor (constructor 1) with less parameters
  <break>
  </break>
  So basically the former of what you said.

  It's worth mentioning that using this() is much better practice when it applies, and we will expect that from you after we teach overloading constructors/methods and using this(). If a similar question like this was on an exam you may lose points for rewriting code that you don't need to.

  No. Either way is fine. With calling the first constructor from the second, you may have some problems with assert statements. Read the pinned note on Assignment A1 for information about that.
