 Let's say that I am implementing a fruitful method and I know that all inputs will go through an if-loop that I wrote in the method body.
</p>
<p>
 Because I know this, I write a return statement in the if-loop body. However, do I also have to write a return statement outside of the if-loop body as well? I feel like the Java compiler will not know that all inputs will go through the if-loop body and raise an error telling me to write a return statement outside of the if-loop body as well.
</p>
<p>
 Is this thinking correct?

  Yes, and additionally you could put the return statement in an else statement, and the compiler would allow that. I think you'll also benefit from trying these scenarios out in Eclipse.

   Yes, you need a return statement for the whole method so you ensure javaâ€™s compiler something is being returned in the worst case (no if statements are entered)
