  Let's say that I am implementing a fruitful method and I know that all inputs will go through an if-loop that I wrote in the method body.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Because I know this, I write a return statement in the if-loop body. However, do I also have to write a return statement outside of the if-loop body as well? I feel like the Java compiler will not know that all inputs will go through the if-loop body and raise an error telling me to write a return statement outside of the if-loop body as well.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Is this thinking correct?

  Yes, you need a return statement for the whole method so you ensure javaâ€™s compiler something is being returned in the worst case (no if statements are entered)

  Yes, and additionally you could put the return statement in an else statement, and the compiler would allow that. I think you'll also benefit from trying these scenarios out in Eclipse.
