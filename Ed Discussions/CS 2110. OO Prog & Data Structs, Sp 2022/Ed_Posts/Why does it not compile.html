 For the 4th assignment statement, I thought because TreeSet is a subtype of set, that the code would compile. But is TreeSet not a subtype of set? Or is the reason why it does not compile because s points to a HashSet and the evaluation of an assignment happens bottom-up?

  TreeSet is a subtype of Set so 3 will compile because you can cast up. However, set is not a subtype of treeSet and so you cannot cast down. Java knows this so 4 will not compile

   Oh okay, what if a superclass is set to a new instance of its subclass instead of a variable pointing to it? Would that compile because that is explicit downcasting? Thanks!
