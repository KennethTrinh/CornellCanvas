 For the surroundLittles function, are we allowed to use the isLowerCase() method?

  You are allowed to, but it won't help you since there are characters that are considered lower case that you don't want to do anything with.

   It would not help you since that accounts for those weird letters too that are lowercase, which is not a lowercase letter you want to account for in your code.
