 Howdy,
</p>
<p>
 Just wondering, in this question, if we put new HashMap&lt;Item, Integer&gt; (); instead of just new HashMap&lt;&gt;() would we get points taken off? Is there a reason the types aren't included, or is it like a "they aren't necessary but there's nothing wrong with including them" thing? Thanks!

  You can put them in but they aren't necessary because they can be inferred from the declaration of stock.
