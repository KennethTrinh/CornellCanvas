  I already have Java installed with Hotspot instead of OpenJ9. Should I reinstall or is there no need?

  Use the checks for the Java version that are provided on the Canvas page to check if your version of Java is the one we will be using in class. If it is not, be sure to reinstall the version of Java we are using for the class (Java 11).

  As long as you are using Eclipse and have Java set to use Java 11, it should be fine.
