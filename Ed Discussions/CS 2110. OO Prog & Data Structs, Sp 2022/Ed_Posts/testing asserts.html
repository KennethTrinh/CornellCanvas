  Do the testing assert statement 25 test cases only include assertThrows() cases (where the assert statment throws an error) or do they also include assertEquals() cases (where the assert statement does nothing)?

  It's about 25. Don't be concerned with the exact number.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Look at your assert statements and put in an assertThrows for each individual part in them. That is all. You can't test assert statements with assertEquals
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Check only whether the assert statement properly throws exceptions, using assertThrows in the JUnit testing class.

  Again, don't be concerned with the number of tests. You instead aim to cover all cases with your tests rather than writing a certain number of tests

  It is just with assertThrows because the number was referring to testing assert statements.
