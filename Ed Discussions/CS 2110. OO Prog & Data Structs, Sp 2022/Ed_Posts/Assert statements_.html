  Do we need an assert statement for the method gotBefore despite it not explicitly stating that there is a precondition? The docstring "p is not null" kind of suggests that there is a precondition.

  If there's no precondition, you should not have any assert statements.

  That "p is not null"  is part of the statement in the specification that says what is to be returned. If p is null, false should be returned.
