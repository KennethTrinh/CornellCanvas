 My partner and I were testing CovidRouteTo(), and after running the JUnit tests, our previously working method contains() failed its test cases. We were confused because we hadn't changed anything in contains and are pretty sure there are no new calls to it. We tried deleting the code that we had for CovidRouteTo, and then method 3 started to run normally again. We put back the code for CovidRouteTo(), and contains() once again failed. We're not sure why this is happening.
