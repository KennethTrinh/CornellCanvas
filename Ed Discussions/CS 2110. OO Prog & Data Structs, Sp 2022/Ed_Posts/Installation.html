 In a5, it is very clear on how to install files.
</p>
<p>
 However, for other coding purposes is there an easier way?
</p>
<p>
 Is the algorithm for installing always as so:
</p>
<p>
 1. download folder of files
</p>
<p>
 2. unzip
</p>
<p>
 3. import files into newly created class
</p>
<p>
 4. build path (compiling source code) of junit test case and other files
</p>
<p>
 Thanks!
</p>

  Basically, that is the way to build a project from given files.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are some shortcuts. For example, in Eclipse, one can use menu item File-&gt; Export to export a project in a certain form and then have someone else use File -&gt; Import to import that project into their Eclipse.
 </p>
 <p>
  We have not been using this feature.
