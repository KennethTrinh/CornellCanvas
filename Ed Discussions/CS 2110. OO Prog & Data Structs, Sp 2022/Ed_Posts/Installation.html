  In a5, it is very clear on how to install files.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  However, for other coding purposes is there an easier way?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Is the algorithm for installing always as so:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1. download folder of files
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. unzip
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  3. import files into newly created class
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  4. build path (compiling source code) of junit test case and other files
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thanks!

  Basically, that is the way to build a project from given files.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  There are some shortcuts. For example, in Eclipse, one can use menu item File-&gt; Export to export a project in a certain form and then have someone else use File -&gt; Import to import that project into their Eclipse.

  We have not been using this feature.
