 For addAdvisor1(PhD p), one of the preconditions is that first advisor is unknown...I understand how to assert this. But how is this assert statement tested in the format of assertThrows(AssertionError.
 <b>
  class

 , () -&gt; {; });
</p>
<p>
 I'm confused because the assert statement has nothing to do with PhD p.

  Right, it has nothing to do with parameter p. If you’ve written the correct assert statement, you’ll know it has to do with one of the fields. How would we read/set that field from outside the class?
