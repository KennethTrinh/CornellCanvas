 When do you set dividers to be equal to 0 and when do you set them to be -1?  (The first index or nonexistent index)?

  Depends whether they're on the left/right of the line, this helps determine that, so to the left usually means -1 and to the right usually means 0.

   OMG this just made things a lot more clearer TYSM. I was looking at the Dutch flag algo on hypertext and was wondering why h and k were not set to -1. I hope I am not setting a trap for myself by using this method lol please tell me. Thank you.

     Like are there some circumstances where this (the tactic you gave) would not apply or does it always apply?
    </p>
    <p>
     Also another question please;
    </p>
    <p>
     If class Dog extends class Animal, and variable Animal pet contains a pointer to a Dog object, then the statement Dog spike= pet; is legal. is False. Why?
    </p>

      usually my tactic is correct, but always double check with the follower- start rule thing to always be 100% sure because sometimes you don't know whether you want the boundary to be b.length-1 or 0 etc...
      <break>
      </break>
     </p>
     <p>
      because pet's static type is Animal, the compiler doesn't know what the dynamic type of pet is (we know it's Dog but the compiler doesn't) so it doesn't let you do Dog spike = pet;
     </p>
