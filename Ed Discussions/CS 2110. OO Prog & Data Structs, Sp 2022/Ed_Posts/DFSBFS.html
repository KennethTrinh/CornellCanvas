  BFS is faster for dense graphs while DFS is faster for sparse graphs. False
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Is this question false because it really doesn't matter and they have the same run-time complexity or is there a preference of one over the other?

  Yes, they basically both process all reachable nodes and edges.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The preference of one over the other depends entirely on the application.

  Example, supposed we have a graph of all flights in the US. Suppose we want to find flights from Ithaca to San Francisco with more more than 1 stop. Well, DFS one' give it to you easily. But do a BFS but stop when all nodes two steps from Ithaca have been found.
