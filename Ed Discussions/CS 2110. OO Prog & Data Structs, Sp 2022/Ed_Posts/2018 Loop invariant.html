  How did we determine that this is the loop invariant we want? Can someone explain please? I thought it would be best to seperate it into 5 segments, 2 isbread(), isPb(), and two unknown regions, but I don't think that looks anything like solution

  I'm not sure why you would want 2 unknown regions. 1 is much easier to deal with because once it is empty, you know you want to terminate. As for where it goes, there are 4 possible places. Refer to the dutch flag problem from the practice problems in recitation.
