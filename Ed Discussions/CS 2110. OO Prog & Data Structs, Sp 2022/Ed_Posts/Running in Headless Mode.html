  I'm trying to run the program multiple times so I put -n 10 in the arguments, but the GUI automatically popped up. How do I run the program in headless mode?

  You have to run it from GameState, I believe. GameState has method main.

  Open GameState in the editing pane and cause it to be run. Since you have put no argument, it will run a random seed.

  Now do Run Configurations and put in -1 10.
