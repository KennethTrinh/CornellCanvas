 Hello, I was wondering if we have to complete the CMS quiz in one sitting, or if we could keep coming back to it until the due date. Additionally, is it open book?
</p>
<p>
 Thank you!

   The CMS quiz is not timed, so you can come back to it later, but it also isn't particularly difficult. It is just some review on the topics covered in the JavaHyperText tutorial.
