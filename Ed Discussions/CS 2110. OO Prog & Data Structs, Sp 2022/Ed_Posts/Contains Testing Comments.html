  Hello,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I just want to ask for clarification on some of the comments above the testing methods for A5. Lines 43-46 of CovidTreeTest.java are as follows:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  * you can test whether HumanA and HumanL are in it using
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  *
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  * assertEquals(true, ct.contains(HumanA));
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  * assertEquals(false, ct.contains(HumanC));
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Is line 46 a typo (HumanC instead of HumanL), or is Human C not in the tree generate by makeTree1(). Thanks in advance.
 </paragraph>

  The point of that is to just show you the syntax on how to test your contains method. To actually develop test cases you do this on line 189. And yes you are right, it should be HumanL.
