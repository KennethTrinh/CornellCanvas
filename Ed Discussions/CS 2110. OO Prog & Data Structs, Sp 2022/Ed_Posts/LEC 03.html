  If you're able to store an array in another array, doesn't that make it multidimensional? Unless I am not completely getting the meaning of the term "one-dimensional".

  Arrays may be nested to capture higher dimensions like the array of arrays you are describing.

  In Java, one cal declare a 1-dimensional array b (say) who elements are of type int[]. There for b[1] can contain a value of type int[]. Suppose b[1] contains the array with values (5, 3, 8, 0 ,2). Then b[1][2] contains the value 8.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Note that the notation b[1, 2] cannot be used. One has to write b[1][2]. However, you can THINK of b as contains a 2-dimensional array if you want.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  But note that the different "rows" b[0], b[1], b[2] need not contains the same number of elements! One can have a "ragged" array. Look up  "ragged"  in JavaHyperText for more details.
