 I'm not really sure if a priority queue is an Abstract Data Type, an interface, or both. It's hard to make sense for me right now.
</p>
<p>
 Is a priority queue an Abstract Data Type which can be implemented with a heap? Is that correct?

  Look at JavaHyperText.
 </p>
 <p>
  Type "priority" into the Filter Field and look at the one pdf file there.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first thing the pdf file does is define priority queue, giving the values and the operations on them. That is a definition of a TYPE. We would call it an ABSTRACT DATA TYPE because there is no notion of implementation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Later, several implementations are given for this ADT.
