  How do I create an instance of class Node? And will the Node automatically be added to the linked list that I am modifying since it is an inner class?

  You have to manually add it to the list by adjusting nodes in the list so they point to the new node.

  How do I know what list I am modifying the nodes in? Is it just DLList? I was planning on just creating a new node, changing its val, then changing its next.

  Your class DLList represents the list. You have to code the behavior of all linked lists by coding the class. So for example if you append something to the list you have to change the pointers of the nodes already in the list or make it the head and tail if the list is empty to begin with
