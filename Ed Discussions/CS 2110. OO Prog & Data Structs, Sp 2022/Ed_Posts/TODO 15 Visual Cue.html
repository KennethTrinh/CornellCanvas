  The game runs and saves the file to the proper tester.txt file (an arbitrary file created to test the save method), however on the dialog screen where the user is prompted to choose a file to save in, all of the files excluding the folders are blurred out gray, almost as if they are not able to be selected.

  I was directly told by a TA to request a question on ED as they too were unsure of what to do. Apparently, the solutions also have the same issue of files appearing "grayed-out."

  Assuming you are on a Mac, this is all expected behavior and not an error. Try opening a save dialog from another application on a Mac. E.g., Word. You will see existing files are grayed out. This is how the Mac GUI works.
