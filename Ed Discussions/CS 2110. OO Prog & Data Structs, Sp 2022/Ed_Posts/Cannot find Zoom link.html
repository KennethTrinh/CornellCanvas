 Hello!
</p>
<p>
 I want to join the 7:30 pm OH by Haonan Peng but I cannot find a zoom link on the OH page on canvas. Just wondering if the link will be made available then or am I supposed to look somewhere else.
</p>
<p>
 Thank you!
</p>

  Haonan's consulting hours (and all other online consulting hours) are on QueueMeIn (listed on the location of the event). That means you will line up in QueueMeIn, you put your own a Zoom link, and he will answer questions in the order of the queue by joining your Zoom.
