  Hello!
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I want to join the 7:30 pm OH by Haonan Peng but I cannot find a zoom link on the OH page on canvas. Just wondering if the link will be made available then or am I supposed to look somewhere else.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thank you!

  Haonan's consulting hours (and all other online consulting hours) are on QueueMeIn (listed on the location of the event). That means you will line up in QueueMeIn, you put your own a Zoom link, and he will answer questions in the order of the queue by joining your Zoom.
