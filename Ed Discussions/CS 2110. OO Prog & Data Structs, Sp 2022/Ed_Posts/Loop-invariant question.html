  Can we use either for-loops or while loops when writing our loops for the problem set (q5)? I saw in the Java Hypertext pdf that the example given was a while loop but I was wondering if it makes any difference to use a for loop.

  You can use either a for loop or a while loop, whichever is most appropriate.

  For some algorithms, like the Dutch National Flag and binary search, it makes no sense to use a for-loop because there is no single loop variable that increased or decreased.

  I generally prefer starting the development of an algorithm using a while loop, but if I know that a for-loop will be easier, I switch to it.
