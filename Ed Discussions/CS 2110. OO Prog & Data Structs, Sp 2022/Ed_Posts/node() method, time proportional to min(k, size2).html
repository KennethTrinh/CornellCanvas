  For the node() method, I could check by inspection that the method takes time proportional to k in the case where k &lt; size/2, but was having trouble checking the other case (k &gt;= size/2). Can I get some help on this?

  What is the problem in not inspecting it?

  If you wrote the loop, what is the difficulty of determined, roughly, the maximum number of iterations?
