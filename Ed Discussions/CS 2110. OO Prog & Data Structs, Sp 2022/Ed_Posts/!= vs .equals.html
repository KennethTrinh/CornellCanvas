 Do we ever have to use .equals instead of != in A1? Particularly when comparing if one PhD instance is the same as another PhD instance?

  If you want to check if the objects are the same exact object in memory, use ==. If you have some different implementation for checking if two PhD's are equal (or objects of some other class), use .equals(). This isn't the case since you haven't written a different implementation for .equals() in A1. In A1, you should be using == and != since we want to check if the objects are the same object in memory.

   You use != because == and != checks if the space in memory is not the same so if they’re the same object they’d both point to the same location in memory, as mentioned in this assignment you’d do:
   <break>
   </break>
   this != p
