  I was wondering if we were allowed to use the function containsKey() for the HashMap in a7? I know that the assignment restricts us from using many graph methods, but wasn't sure if this counted as a graph method because I'm still trying to grasp what each data structure count as?

  The HashMap is not part of the graph.

  Use any methods you want from it.

  We did not have to use method contains. We used methods get and put, that is all.

  By this, do you mean you didn't use method containsKey() on the hashmap? Because I can't seem to figure out another way to check whether w is in S or F.

  You can check by doing .get(w). If that’s null then it’s not in the hashmap.
