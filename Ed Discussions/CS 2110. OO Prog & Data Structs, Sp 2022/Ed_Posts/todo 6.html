  Hi, for TODO six, I understand that we are supposed to call the checkHit method and it takes two integer arguments, my confusion is what those arguments are suppose to be in the paintdot function. Is it supposed to be the x and y fields of target or are we supposed to make a new mouseevent object and use getX() and get()? I have been stuck on this since yesternight and help would be appreciated. Thank you.

  Just use the isHit field, that tells you whether the ball has been hit or not
