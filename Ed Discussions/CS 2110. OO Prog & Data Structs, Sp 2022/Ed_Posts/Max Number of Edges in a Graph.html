  Why is the maximum number of edges in a graph |V|^2 and not |V|*2?

  The example below explains my logic:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For a graph with 3 nodes, the maximum number of edges is 3*2 since you can have 2 directed edges between each node. I don't see where the extra three edges could come from (with 3^2).

  Also depends on whether the edges are directed or undirected.

  So, if the edges are undirected, would the max number of edges only be |V|-1?

  Suppose the graph has n nodes, numbered 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Let it have:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Leaving node 0: n-1 edges to nodes with numbers in 1..n-1
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Leaving node 1 (and not counted in the above): n-2 edges to nodes with numbers in 2..n-1
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Leaving node 2 (and not counted in the above): n-3 edges to nodes with numbers in 2..n-1
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  ...
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Add up  (n-1) + (n-2) + (n-3) ... + 1 + 0/
