 Why is the maximum number of edges in a graph |V|^2 and not |V|*2?

 The example below explains my logic:
</p>
<p>
 For a graph with 3 nodes, the maximum number of edges is 3*2 since you can have 2 directed edges between each node. I don't see where the extra three edges could come from (with 3^2).

  Suppose the graph has n nodes, numbered 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1.
 </p>
 <p>
  Let it have:
 </p>
 <p>
  Leaving node 0: n-1 edges to nodes with numbers in 1..n-1
 </p>
 <p>
  Leaving node 1 (and not counted in the above): n-2 edges to nodes with numbers in 2..n-1
 </p>
 <p>
  Leaving node 2 (and not counted in the above): n-3 edges to nodes with numbers in 2..n-1
 </p>
 <p>
  ...
 </p>
 <p>
  Add up  (n-1) + (n-2) + (n-3) ... + 1 + 0/
 </p>

   There are self directed loops that are possible

    Also depends on whether the edges are directed or undirected.

     So, if the edges are undirected, would the max number of edges only be |V|-1?
