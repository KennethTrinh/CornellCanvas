 My partner and I keep getting the error where Pollack goes down a dead end and then returns an error since they can not turn back. How do we check to see if the route can lead to the orb?

  You appear to be having trouble with find().
 </p>
 <p>
  Post your method find() AND ITS SPECIFICATION. Before you do that, read what we say about writing find() in the pinned A8 three. The instructions/suggestions we place there are supposed to help you in writing the method.

   She can turn back. You probably tried to move to a location that is not adjacent to the current location and that caused your error. You should be implementing the DFSWalk as the assignment instructions suggest and slightly modifying it. The DFSWalk ensures that you always walk back to your starting position. JHT gives this method in abstract form. All you have to do is put it in Java, and return when you reach the orb.
