 I'm struggling with understanding the distinction between counting and searching methods when it comes to recursion — I get that searching is when we look for a node with a specific property, but if we count all such nodes (for example, in width at depth, where we count all the nodes at depth d and return the number), then does that make it a counting method instead? Any clarification about this distinction would be great

  If you are looking for a single node with a proper, that is a searching method.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you are going count has many nodes have a certain property, that is a counting method.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is that simply. It has NOTHING to do with what value the method returns.
