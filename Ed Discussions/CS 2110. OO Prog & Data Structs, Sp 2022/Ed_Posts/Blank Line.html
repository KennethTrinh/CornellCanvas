  Are we supposed to have a blank line between the first line reading "package a1" and the first Javadoc comment line reading "NetId: nnn . .  ."? Thanks!

  I'm just curious a bit curious about what you mean by "original file"â€”I thought that we created these .java files from scratch.

  Whoops, never mind. Sometimes our assignments will include release code for you to start with. That wasn't the case here. I remembered wrong.
