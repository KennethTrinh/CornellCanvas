<p>
 Are we supposed to have a blank line between the first line reading "package a1" and the first Javadoc comment line reading "NetId: nnn . .  ."? Thanks!

  I don't think it matters, but that seems to be how we left it for you in the original file so yes that's fine.

   Hi! Thank you so much!
  </p>

   I'm just curious a bit curious about what you mean by "original file"â€”I thought that we created these .java files from scratch.

    Whoops, never mind. Sometimes our assignments will include release code for you to start with. That wasn't the case here. I remembered wrong.
