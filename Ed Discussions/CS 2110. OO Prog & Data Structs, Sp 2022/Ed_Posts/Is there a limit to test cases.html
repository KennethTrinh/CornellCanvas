 Are we allowed to have more test cases or should we just have the amount suggested?

  There is no limit to test cases, but you should follow our guidelines on how many testing procedures you should have.

   Too few cases is bad because you may not find all the errors.

   Too many test case is fine, it just wastes your time.
