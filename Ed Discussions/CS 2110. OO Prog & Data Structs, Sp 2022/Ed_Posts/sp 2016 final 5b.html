  Why do the edge weights in the order added to the forest (for Kruskal) only go up to 12?

  But wouldn't the answer be 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 19? I thought the edges 15, 16, 19 must also be added or there wouldn't be a spanning tree. And these don't create a cycle. I am just confused as to why they stopped writing the edge weights at 12.

  I got the same answer above. I am also confused about this because I thought the number of edges in a spanning tree was equal to n-1 nodes and there are 9 nodes, so I thought we would need at least 8 edges listed.
