 Hello! I was going through the panapto lectures and I noticed that they mention class class. Just wanted to know if that is included in this semester's syllabus. Thank you!

  We discussed class class when introducing equality.

  Look at the lecture slides for Lecture 7, polymorphism 2, where we discuss casting and method equals.
