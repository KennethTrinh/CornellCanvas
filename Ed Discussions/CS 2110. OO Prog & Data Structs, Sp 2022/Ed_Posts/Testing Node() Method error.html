 As I was testing my node method, I tried testing a list of type  Integers but the error of the assert equals line says  " The method assertEquals(Object, Object) is ambiguous for the type DLListTest".
</p>
<p>
 However, when I tried testing my node method with a list of Strings, it worked fine. I fixed the list of type integers by creating an Integer object ( made that object equal to one of the append integer values)  and used that as an output in the assert equals to test my node method.  However, without creating the integer object, I don't know why I have that error?

  We would probably need to see your code to get the full context of what is happening. If you would like us to look at the code, you can post it in a private question.
