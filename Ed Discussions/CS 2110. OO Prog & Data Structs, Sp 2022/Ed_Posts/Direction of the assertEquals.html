  Does it matter if testing is written as
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1) assertEquals(test.isSibling(test1), true);
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  OR
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2) assertEquals(true, test.isSibling(test1));
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I know practically this doesn't have a difference, but is it bad practice or should one be used and not the other.

  The definition is  assertEquals(expected val, computed val);
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  so use it only that way. If it succeeds, it doesn't matter, but if it fails, the error message won't make sense if wrote in wrongly.
