 For Todo 5, I've created my timer and moved on to Todo 6 and everything is working fine other than the fact that towards the end my circles are being spawned in faster and faster until termination. I'm looking online and am seeing that I may have done some sort of accidental recursion but can't figure out where in the code this is happening.

  Nevermind I think I figured it out. I was creating an entirely new timer object with a different actionlistener in my code for timeout() because I didn't see that timeout() is supposed to be the acitonlistener in the first line of code for GameComponent. It seems to be working normally now
