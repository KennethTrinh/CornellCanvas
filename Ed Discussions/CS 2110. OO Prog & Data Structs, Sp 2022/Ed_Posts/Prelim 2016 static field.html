 For this question, why does the value of p change? For example, when you do int x = c.m1(4), doesn't this just use m1(4) to store something in x, rather than actually executing m1(4) and modifying the static field p?

  The only way to show you this is to execute the code CAREFULLY, drawing objects when new-expressions are created, etc. We do not have time to do this for you now.

  Try it yourself, doing it CAREFULLY. Show us your steps. When done, we can look at the result and see if ou made a mistake.
