  The first time I ran the application, the GUI popped up and displayed a one node tree. I did not touch the code before or after my first run, but now whenever I run the application an exception is thrown by one of the stubbed methods. Is the GUI "supposed to" pop up before implementation of any of the methods? Or was that a fluke somehow?

  That was probably a fluke. The GUI depends on the methods you write; if they are not written, can't tell what it will do.
