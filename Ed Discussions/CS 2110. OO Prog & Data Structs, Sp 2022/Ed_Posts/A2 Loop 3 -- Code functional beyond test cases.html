  My code for loop 3 passed all of the test cases, though I noted that the spec requires that it return the
  <italic>
   <bold>
    last
   </bold>
  </italic>
  value that is divisible by 5 and not the first one that is such. I'm not exactly sure how one would do this in a for, conditional pair without returning outside of the loop. Will this be an issue or does passing the test cases mean I did what was required?

  (I didn't write it specifically to pass the cases but rather noticed that they all convened around a single range of &lt;=5...)

  Pasting test cases is sufficient enough
