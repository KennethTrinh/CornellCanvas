 My code for loop 3 passed all of the test cases, though I noted that the spec requires that it return the
 <i>
  <b>
   last
  </b>
 </i>
 value that is divisible by 5 and not the first one that is such. I'm not exactly sure how one would do this in a for, conditional pair without returning outside of the loop. Will this be an issue or does passing the test cases mean I did what was required?
</p>
<p>
 (I didn't write it specifically to pass the cases but rather noticed that they all convened around a single range of &lt;=5...)

  Pasting test cases is sufficient enough

   If you want the first thing in a range m..n, start looking from the beginning.

   If you want the last thing in a range m..n, start looking from the end.
