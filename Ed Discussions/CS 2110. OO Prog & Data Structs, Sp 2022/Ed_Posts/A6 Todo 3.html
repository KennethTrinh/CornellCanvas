  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I am currently on A6 Todo 3. I think I have written the method correctly but when I run the game &amp; click on start button, nothing happens. I am not sure if nothing is happening because I have not implemented any of the other methods or because I wrote it wrong.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thanks!

  If your start button is there and the score label appears then I think you're good.
