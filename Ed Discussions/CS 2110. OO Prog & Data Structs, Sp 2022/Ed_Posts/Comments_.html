 If we left // comments in our code (not javadoc) that just explain what we did and our thought process, should we delete them before submitting (are such comments considered sloppiness)?

  That's fine if you have some comments explaining things. Just as long as it's not a comment every line or every other line, that's fine.

   On that note, what is considered sloppiness?
