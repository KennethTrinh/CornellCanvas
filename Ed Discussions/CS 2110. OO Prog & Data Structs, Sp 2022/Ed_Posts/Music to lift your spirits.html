 Some are just happy and help bring us together, others show how people are coping with social separation, and others show us with song and dance what we should be doing to help stop Covid-19.

 Here's a gospel song, "The Storm is Passing Over". You don't have to be a Christian to enjoy this rendition and its message, to experience some of the joy the performers and audience feel. The conductor is like no other.

  I also wrote a song about COVID-19 in the early weeks that was on the local news and radio. It’s called “I Hate Quarantine”. This is the worst version and I sound awful, but this is the only version posted. My school made the video. I just made the song.
