  Here's a gospel song, "The Storm is Passing Over". You don't have to be a Christian to enjoy this rendition and its message, to experience some of the joy the performers and audience feel. The conductor is like no other.

  I also wrote a song about COVID-19 in the early weeks that was on the local news and radio. It’s called “I Hate Quarantine”. This is the worst version and I sound awful, but this is the only version posted. My school made the video. I just made the song.
