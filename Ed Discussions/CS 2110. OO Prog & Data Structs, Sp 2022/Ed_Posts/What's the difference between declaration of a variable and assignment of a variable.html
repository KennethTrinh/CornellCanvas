  Yes, and I will add onto that with this example:
 </p>
 <p>
  int x;
 </p>
 <p>
  This is a
  <b>
   declaration
  </b>
  of variable x, indicating that it can hold a value of type int.
 </p>
 <p>
  --------
 </p>
 <p>
  x= 25 + 1;
 </p>
 <p>
  This is an
  <b>
   assignment statement
  </b>
  . Its execution evaluates the expression 25+1 to yield the value 26 and stores that value in x.
 </p>
 <p>
  -------
 </p>
 <p>
  int x= 25+1;
 </p>
 <p>
  One can combine a declaration and an initial assignment to it, as shown here. The "int x" part
  <b>
   declares
  </b>
  variable x of type int.
 </p>
 <p>
  The "x= 25+1" part
  <b>
   assigns
  </b>
  it the initial value 26.
 </p>
 <p>
  From JHT: "[A variable declaration] has the form &lt;
  <i>
   type
  </i>
  &gt; &lt;
  <i>
   variable-name
  </i>
  &gt;."
 </p>

   What's the difference between the declaration of an array and the creation of an array? Is it similar to this?

    Declaring a variable is the same no matter the type. Arrays themselves are also types. Just like you have int, float, double, you also have int[], float[], double[].
   </p>
   <p>
    -------
   </p>
   <p>
    So the
    <b>
     declaration
    </b>
    of an array of ints would be just:
   </p>
   <p>
    int[] x;
   </p>
   <p>
    ---------
   </p>
   <p>
    We can create an array, with its elements set to their default values, and then assign it to variable x:
   </p>
   <p>
    x= new int[3];
   </p>
   <p>
    ---------
   </p>
   <p>
    Combined declaration, creating and then assignment of new array to variable x:
   </p>
   <p>
    int[] x= new int[3];
   </p>
   <p>
    ---------
   </p>
   <p>
    I think you'll benefit from reading this as well! It goes more into depth about creating/initializing the elements of an array, and also array initializers. https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/JavaAndDS/files/arrays.pdf

   Declaring a variable allocates a new piece of memory for storing that variable.
  </p>
  <p>
   Assigning value to a variable just replaces the value on that variable and doesn't require new memory spaces.
  </p>
  <p>
   In Java, declaring a variable often gives it a default value though.
