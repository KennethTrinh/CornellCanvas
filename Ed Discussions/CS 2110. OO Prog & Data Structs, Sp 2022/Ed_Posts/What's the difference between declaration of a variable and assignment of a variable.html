  Yes, and I will add onto that with this example:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  int x;
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  This is a
  <bold>
   declaration
  </bold>
  of variable x, indicating that it can hold a value of type int.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  --------
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  x= 25 + 1;
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  This is an
  <bold>
   assignment statement
  </bold>
  . Its execution evaluates the expression 25+1 to yield the value 26 and stores that value in x.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  -------
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  int x= 25+1;
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  One can combine a declaration and an initial assignment to it, as shown here. The "int x" part
  <bold>
   declares
  </bold>
  variable x of type int.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The "x= 25+1" part
  <bold>
   assigns
  </bold>
  it the initial value 26.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  From JHT: "[A variable declaration] has the form &lt;
  <italic>
   type
  </italic>
  &gt; &lt;
  <italic>
   variable-name
  </italic>
  &gt;."

  Declaring a variable allocates a new piece of memory for storing that variable.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Assigning value to a variable just replaces the value on that variable and doesn't require new memory spaces.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  In Java, declaring a variable often gives it a default value though.

  What's the difference between the declaration of an array and the creation of an array? Is it similar to this?

  Declaring a variable is the same no matter the type. Arrays themselves are also types. Just like you have int, float, double, you also have int[], float[], double[].
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  -------
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  So the
  <bold>
   declaration
  </bold>
  of an array of ints would be just:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  int[] x;
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  ---------
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  We can create an array, with its elements set to their default values, and then assign it to variable x:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  x= new int[3];
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  ---------
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Combined declaration, creating and then assignment of new array to variable x:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  int[] x= new int[3];
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  ---------
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I think you'll benefit from reading this as well! It goes more into depth about creating/initializing the elements of an array, and also array initializers. https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/JavaAndDS/files/arrays.pdf
