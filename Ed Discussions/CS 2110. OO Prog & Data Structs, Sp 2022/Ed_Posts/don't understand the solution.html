  Basically when you create an object and assign it to a variable, that variable just has a pointer to the memory location of that object in the heap

  The expression 5+6 evaluates to 11. And you can have an assignment  like
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  int b= 5+6;
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  In the same way,    new C(5)    is an expression and it is evaluated to give a value: a pointer to the newly created object. So, one can write
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  C v= new C(5) ;
