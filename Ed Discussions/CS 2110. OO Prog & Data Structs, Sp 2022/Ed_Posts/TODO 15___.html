 I am testing my try-catch statement by trying to select a PDF file to save to, which I expect should cause the ERROR dialog to appear. However, the ERROR dialog does not seem to be triggered by this action. Is my assumption (that trying to save to a PDF should cause the dialog to appear) correct?

  Your assumption is, I regret to inform you, incorrect. The handout describes how to test this with read-only files. Do that.
