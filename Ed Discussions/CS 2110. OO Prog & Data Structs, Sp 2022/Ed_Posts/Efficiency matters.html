  Do we get points deducted if we write a very inefficient piece of code that still works?  For example, say I didn't know the function to compare two strings.  If I checked each element of the string manually using an if statement, as opposed to using equals(), or ==, will I get points deducted?

  Time complexity is not in scope, so I would assume that efficiency doesn't matter for this exam.
