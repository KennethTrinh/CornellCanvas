  For this question, is it required to have U.sumE(..) versus just sumE(..)? I don't recall referencing the class in my assignments.

  It depends on the question, in the above example I provide it says you don't need the formal calls, for the screenshot you gave it never said that.

  In your example it says "write down, in java, the code for the test cases"

  My question was more about whether we need U.sumE(..) in order for the code to be correct, or if it's just as correct to just have sumE (...), where I don't reference class U.

  ohhhhh, I don't think that would work, you need an object to test the non static method
