 I have a few questions about how to use Eclipse. I tried to look for information in the JavaHypertext website and past videos, but I can't seem to find it.
</p>
<p>
 How do you import Java files into a default package (after you create a new project and class)?
</p>
<p>
 How do you add more than one test case to a test file? When I create a new test file, I only seem to have the option to create a new "JUnit Test Case." When I try to type in more than one test case, a lot of errors pop up since the @Test is not recognized as an annotation.

  1. There are several ways to add an existing class xxx.java (say) to a project. We mention two of them.
 </p>
 <p>
  A. (1) Find the file on you hard drive (on a Mac, use the Finder) and navigate to the directory that contains xxx.java.  (2) Copy the file (command-c on the Mac, control-c on the PC). (3) Return to Eclipse, select directory src in project, and paste the file (command-v on the Mac, control-v on the PC).
 </p>
 <p>
  A. (1) Find the file on you hard drive (on a Mac, use the Finder) and navigate to the directory that contains xxx.java.  (2) Press your mouse on xxx.java and drag to where you want to place the file in the Eclipse project.
 </p>
 <p>
  2. At times, in Eclipse, your .java file in the editing pane may be missing some imports --there's a red x to the left of the line, which says something like "The method assertEquals(int, int) is undefined for ..."
 </p>
 <p>
  To see how to fix this, visit JavaHyperText and press your mouse on "Eclipse" in the top horizontal navigation bar. Look at item 11 in the window that pops up. It will take you to this page:
