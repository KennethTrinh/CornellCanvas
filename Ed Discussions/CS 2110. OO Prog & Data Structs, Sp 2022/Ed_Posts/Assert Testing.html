 Hello!
</p>
<p>
 We are trying to test the assert statements and could only come up with 16 cases. I read on some other post that we should not be too concerned with reaching the 25 test cases limit but since our number is significantly less, just confirming if that is okay.
</p>
<p>
 Thank you!
</p>

  Don't worry about the exact number of tests.
 </p>
 <p>
  Look at your assert statements and write tests for them
