 It's a bit unclear to me what the class invariant is actually made up of from lecture 4; is it basically all the Javadoc comments that explain the method and its parameters? If so, does that mean that all of the parts of a class invariant don't necessarily have to precede the method header since there are usually comments beneath the method header that explain the parameter declarations?

  Since the quiz is currently available, we cannot answer questions about the Lectures that are covered in the quiz til after the quiz is done.

    A class invariant is basically the javadoc comments/specifications for a class's fields. Similar to how methods have specifications, the class invariant consists of the specifications for fields.
