  It's a bit unclear to me what the class invariant is actually made up of from lecture 4; is it basically all the Javadoc comments that explain the method and its parameters? If so, does that mean that all of the parts of a class invariant don't necessarily have to precede the method header since there are usually comments beneath the method header that explain the parameter declarations?

  A class invariant is basically the javadoc comments/specifications for a class's fields. Similar to how methods have specifications, the class invariant consists of the specifications for fields.
