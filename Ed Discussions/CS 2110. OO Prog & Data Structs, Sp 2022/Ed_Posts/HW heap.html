  When you poll from a [max] heap, the root node [lets call A] is switched with the bottom right node. Afterward, bubbling down occurs to correct the tree. However, is A (the original root node) stored in the array still or deleted. I looked at javahypertext and it showed a disconnection from A with the heap; however, does that disconnection represent that A is no longer part of the array or that it is simply hidden in the array.

  That node is STILL in the array! However, it is no longer part of the heap!
