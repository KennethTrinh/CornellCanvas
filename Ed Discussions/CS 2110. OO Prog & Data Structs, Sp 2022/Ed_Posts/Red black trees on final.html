 The final study guide doesn't explicitly say red-black trees aren't covered on the final exam like the Prelim 2 study guide does. Since we didn't learn it in class and it wasn't covered in Prelim 2, can we assume that red black trees will not be included in the final exam?

  They are not covered in the course anymore. You’ll see them in 3110!
