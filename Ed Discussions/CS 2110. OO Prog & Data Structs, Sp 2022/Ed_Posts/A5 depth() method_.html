 The spec says that we should not "have unnecessary calls that traverse the tree." So does that mean we shouldn't look at every node in the tree in our solution. Like we should stop once the node with p is found and the depth is calculated?

  Is depth() a searching method or a counting method?

  When you have decided on that, look at the pattern for that kind of method given in the tutorial and compare it to your method.

   Well, your base case should stop any more recursive calls from happening because if the human.equalsâ„— then your base case will return a 0 as mentioned by the spec.
