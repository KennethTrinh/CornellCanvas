  I saw the mean, median score for the prelim1, but I got no idea where am I standing on the exam or if I did a great job on the prelim. When I was taking CS-1110, usually, the instructor showed an approximate score range for each letter grade(A-levels, B-levels, C-levels) after each prelim. Is it not above the median or average means that you did an A-level job on the prelim? Many thanks!

  Earlier today, (at least some) students got an email from Gradescope no-reply with the statistics. I will copy them here for ease of access. I don't know if these statistics apply only to the 5:30 exam or to both exams, but I imagine the distributions would be similar either way.

  Please read the announcement. "There is no letter grade (A, B, C, D, or F) associated with your score. At the end of the semester, we use your numeric score on the prelim to compute your weighted average, then we make decisions about final letter grades based on that average."

  It's worth 12% of your final grade. This class is not curved, rather we have grade ranges. Feel free to read more under "Notes on Grades" on Canvas. But at this point, we really cannot comment any further.

  Do we know how to transform scores to letter grade for now? For example: 100-95 get A, 95-85 get B.
