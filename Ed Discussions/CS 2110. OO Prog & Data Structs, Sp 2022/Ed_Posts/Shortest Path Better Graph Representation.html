 <paragraph>
  For Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, which representation of the graph leads to a better execution time: adjacency matrix or adjacency list?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I was thinking adjacency matrix would be better since it is O(1) for the expected time to get the distances d[n] for node n. Is this a correct way to think about this?

  It depends on how dense or spare the graph is. If the graph is dense (you will most likely use an adjacency matrix to implement a dense graph) then the execution time of the shortest path is O(n^2logn). If the graph is sparse and you use an adjacency list to implement it, then the execution time is O(nlogn). I hope this helps!
