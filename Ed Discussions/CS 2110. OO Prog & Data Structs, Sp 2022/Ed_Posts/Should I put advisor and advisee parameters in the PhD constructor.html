  I initialized the advisor and advisee fields in the constructor but I realized that they were not included in the parameters given. So should I add the parameters or should I leave out the parameters and not initialize them as well?

  Don't change the signatures of the methods at all. Do not add or delete parameters.

  Read the class invariant. What values should be in all fields? Initialize fields for which there are no parameters to whatever they should be to make the class invariant true.
