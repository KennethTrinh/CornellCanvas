 How extensive should our test cases be? My approach was to keep using the data type string as &lt;E&gt;, and test all the possibilities that can arise when modifying a linked list, as in changing the middle of the list vs. changing the head/tail of the list. Are there other things to cover? I'm wondering how extensive our test cases should be.

  You know about testing by now, having had a recitation on it and seeing test cases in A1, A2, and A3.

 <p>
  You need good code coverage: Look at the code and make sure each part of it is "exercised" in at least one test case.

 <p>
  Then, make sure that extreme cases are handled.
