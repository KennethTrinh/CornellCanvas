 I am having trouble adding another node if the String is not null. If I have one node in it already, and i use append() or prepend(), toString() does not work. toStringRev() does work and even though I wrote it in a similar way to toString(). I saw in a previous question on here if toString() does not work, the nodes are not connecting, can someone give more guidance on what this means? I am confused!
</p>
<p>
 Thanks

  Hard to say anything from what you say.
 </p>
 <p>
  You shouldn't be writing/using prepend before FULLY testing append and toStringRev together --doing also prepend before testing append/toStringRev is just wasting your time.
 </p>
 <p>
  If toString is not working when appending to a list of length 1 (so you end up with a list of length 2), that simply means that append has not been written correctly.  We need to know more to be able to help.

   Hi Dr. Gries thanks for your response. I fully wrote append, prepend &amp; toStringRev(). toString() does not work correctly when appending to a list of length 1; for append, I assign the new node as the tail and for prepend, I assign the new node as head. I increase the size before doing both. Please let me know if this is enough information!

   If your toString doesn’t work but toStringRev does work then that means your head isn’t assigned right or your .next fields are not assigned correctly.

    If it is length of 1, I have to assign the next node to be the node i just created? I do next and it says I cannot because the original string is null. I put a condition if string == null then assign the head to be the new node.
