 I optimized the basic dfs walk with the min heap given in the source. It works on most maps, but for some maps, like seed -5730816059164960561, I still get the bonus as 1. I see people get 1.2 on this map. I really have no idea how to improve this method further. Could someone give me a hint?
</p>

 Thank you so much!

  No idea. You sort the neighbors based on distance to orb.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sometimes, there may be two neighbors that are equidistant to the orb. One may of sorting method might choose one, another sorting method could choose the other.

  Luck of the draw
