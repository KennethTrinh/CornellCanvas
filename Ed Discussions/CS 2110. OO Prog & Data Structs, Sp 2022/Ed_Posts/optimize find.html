  I optimized the basic dfs walk with the min heap given in the source. It works on most maps, but for some maps, like seed -5730816059164960561, I still get the bonus as 1. I see people get 1.2 on this map. I really have no idea how to improve this method further. Could someone give me a hint?

  No idea. You sort the neighbors based on distance to orb.

  Sometimes, there may be two neighbors that are equidistant to the orb. One may of sorting method might choose one, another sorting method could choose the other.

  Luck of the draw
