  Why does boat 4 failing to override getName() indicate that it should be abstract? I understand that subclasses of an abstract class must override abstract methods, but how does that indicate that the boat4 subclass must be abstract?

  Since getName is an abstract method in Boat1, it must be implemented in every non-abstract subclass of Boat1. Since Boat4 is a subclass of Boat1 and doesn't override abstract method getName, then Boat4 must be abstract.
