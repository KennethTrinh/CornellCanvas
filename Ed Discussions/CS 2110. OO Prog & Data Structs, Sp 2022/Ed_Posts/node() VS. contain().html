  Isn't contain basically a simpler version of node? Can we call node when writing contain, or do we have to write the recursive function? Or, can we write it recursively?

  No, you don't have to call node() when writing contains(). You can choose whether to write this one recursively or not, but I think it's easier with recursion because the spec tells you the recursive definition, and you just have to put it in Java.

  Edit: Professor said you can use node() if you want to, so it's up to you.

  If you want, you CAN just call node(). Avoid duplicate work

  I already wrote another recursive definition for it. Is it ok if I don't change it?
