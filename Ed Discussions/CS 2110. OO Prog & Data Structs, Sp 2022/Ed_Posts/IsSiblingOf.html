  Is it possible to have a PhD object that only has one advisor (create it using the second PhD constructor and set the first advisor field and set the other to null)?

  Yes, it is possible. I will double check now to see if the preconditions allow that

  Doesn't the precondition for the second constructor say  'p1
  <bold>
   and
  </bold>
  p2 are not null'? I'm assuming this student is asking about using the second constructor.

  There wouldn't be a situation where you only have a second advisor and the first advisor is null though right?

  No, because the precondition to add a second advisor requires that the first advisor is known

  If you mean setting the advisors in the second constructor, that you'd set one of them to null, then I would highly advise you to look at the preconditions again. If you mean adding one advisor using the addAdvisor1() method, and leaving the second advisor field to be null, then yes, that is allowed.
