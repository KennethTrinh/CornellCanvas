 When I try opening the docx file that I saved my score to this is what pops up so I'm unsure if it's actually saving my score to this file.

  The extension of a file (.txt., .docx, .pptx, etc.) is actually independent of the contents of the file (plain text, Word, Powerpoint, etc.).  You can for example store plain text in a file whose extension is .docx, and that is most likely what OP has done.  If you open said file in a plain text editor, it will look just fine.  But when you try to open a .docx file with Word, and that file does not

  contain a Word document, Word will freak out and give you an error like OP's.

  I would recommend only using plain text files for saving your scores, therefore, in this game.  Anything else will lead to confusion about whether your code is the issue.
