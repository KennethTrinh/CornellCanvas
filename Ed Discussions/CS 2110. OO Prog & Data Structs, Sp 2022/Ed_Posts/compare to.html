  For compareTo, since it is an abstract method from the interface comparable, were we not supposed to create our own method just like what we did for avRatings(example below). Why is it possible to directly call out .compareTo in name.compareTo(obs.name)?

  I am assuming that "name" is a String. In this case, there is a compareTo method defined for Strings so we can use this to compare the two names. In the other case, I think avRating returns a primitive double, which we can't use to directly call the Double implementation of compareTo.
