 Hi there! I am working on asserting preconditions for all of the A4 methods and had a quick question: for methods insertBefore() and delete(), the preconditions are that "n must be a node of this list; it may not be null."
</p>
<p>
 While I know how to easily check that n is not null, what is the best way to go about ensuring it is in the list? Since the method must take constant time, I do not want to loop through each element. One thing I know definitely is that its index must be between 0 and length of the list - is this the right way to go about it?
</p>
<p>
 Thanks!
</p>

  You cannot do this in the amount of time required, so don't worry about asserting preconditions like this. You can just assume the precondition will not be violated.
