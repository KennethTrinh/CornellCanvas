  Hi there! I am working on asserting preconditions for all of the A4 methods and had a quick question: for methods insertBefore() and delete(), the preconditions are that "n must be a node of this list; it may not be null."
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  While I know how to easily check that n is not null, what is the best way to go about ensuring it is in the list? Since the method must take constant time, I do not want to loop through each element. One thing I know definitely is that its index must be between 0 and length of the list - is this the right way to go about it?

  Thanks!

  You cannot do this in the amount of time required, so don't worry about asserting preconditions like this. You can just assume the precondition will not be violated.
