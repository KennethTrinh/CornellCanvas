  For todo 8, I'm trying to call checkHit, but I keep getting an error that the method is undefined for type GameComponent. How do I go about fixing this?

  Because GameComponent doesn't have that method, only an instance of class Target has the checkHit method, look at your fields and see if you have any fields that are an object of class Target.
