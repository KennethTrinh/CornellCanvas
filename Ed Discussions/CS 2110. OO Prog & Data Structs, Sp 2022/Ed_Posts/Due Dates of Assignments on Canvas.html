  I looked through the 3-week schedule and the list of assignments in the 'Assignments' tab on Canvas. Some of the deadlines of the work due do not match on the two webpages.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  E.g. The 3-week schedule says that HW 1 is due Feb. 4, the 'Assignments' page says that HW 1 is due Jan. 28.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  So I am not sure which deadlines are the correct ones. Which deadlines should I stick to?

  It takes time and effort to get this website all correct.

  The Assignments page has been fixed. That assignment is not available until 25 Jan,  so I was wondering how you knew when it was due.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  But I just changed my Canvas website to "Student view" (which I can do) and saw that it says it is locked and doesn't show it but it shows the due date! So I fixed the due date.
