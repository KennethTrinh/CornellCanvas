  That output says you were expecting an answer "[B, C]" but the answer as " C"

   I can't figure out why the root node is not getting added to the list

    Are you adding to the list in the recursive case?

     yes. Just to clarify. we should create a linked list in the base case and in the recursive case, we have to create a list variable that has the value of the return of CovidRouteTo for a child and add the human node to that right?

      Yes, that is correct. In the recursive case, you add to the list if the variable isn't null and then return it. Are you adding to the list in the base case? If human equals c then you have to make a list and add to it in the base case and return it.
