 When I download A2Skeleton.zip off Canvas it opens the file in Atom and not Eclipse. I tried "open with" and search Eclipse but it didn't let me click on Eclipse.

  You aren't supposed to put them into Eclipse that way.
 </p>
 <p>
  Do the following:
 </p>
 <p>
  1. Start a new Java Project in Eclipse. Name it anything you want. Do NOT create module.java or anything like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  2. Copy the two .java files and paste them int src in the new Eclipse project.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you have problems, follow instructions given in the top horizontal navigation bar under Eclipse. There are a lot of different entries there to choose from; choose the obvious ones to help you.
 </p>

   Hello, I followed the instruction and when i opened A2test file in eclipse, every line that has @Test and assertEquals method raises an error and I do not know how to fix this.
  </p>
  <p>
   But when I open it straight from my folders, this does not happen, instead, when I want to run the test cases, a window pops up asking me if want to run it as ant or ant.
