   3. A5: recursion on trees. Grading.
  </bold>
  There were ~50 late A5 submissions, coming in only Monday night. We did not have time to prepare the submissions for grading by TAs until yesterday. We don’t expect them all to be graded until after Spring Break. Sorry about that; We believe in feedback on assignments as soon as possible, rarely more than one week.
