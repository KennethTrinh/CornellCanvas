  Two questions:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Can we rely on the test cases given in the Testcase.java file that accompanies every assignment? If our code passes all test cases provided in Testcase.java, do we have to worry about additional test cases or make our own test cases at any point?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Also, are we encouraged to make our own methods within the assignment or is it feasible to finish every assignment by just implementing the methods given to us in the assignment.java file??
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thanks in advance.

  For A3 you can expect the test cases to be comprehensive and if you pass them without hardcode you're fine, but for assignments like A4 you have to add more test cases than what they provide on the pdf.For your first question, you should be allowed to add more methods as long as they are made private that is something that OOP is good for (but I think itâ€™s too early into the semester to need helper methods), however, it is more than feasible to do all assignments with what's provided in the assignment.java file(so far)

  You should not need to write ANY helper methods unless the handout tells you to. Every method written in A1-A4 should have been short enough that you wouldn't need one.

  The handout lets you know what you can rely on. Like Bahaa said, for A3, if you followed all the guidelines and passed the test cases then you should expect to get 100. In A4, however, you will be graded on your testing file, so your test cases should be comprehensive.
