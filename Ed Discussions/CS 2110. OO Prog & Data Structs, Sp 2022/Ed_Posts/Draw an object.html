  Just one basic question when I am checking all the terms on JavaHypertext. I can understand where we've got c and b but this Object is confusing to me. I can't find anything from coding that relates to equals() or toString().

  equals() and toString() are defined in class Object. A lot of other things are declared there too. You will learn more about them as time goes on.

  Type   java 8 Object   into a search engine and find the API documentation for class Object read a bit about it.
