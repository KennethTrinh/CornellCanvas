 For canvas quiz 3, we had 2 questions relating to runtime and, at the time, hadn’t covered these. I remember Prof Gries saying those two wouldn’t count on our score. However on Cms, I see that these two questions are reflected in our score.

<p>
 Will this be changed or is the plan to keep it as so?

   Hm, i dont see this reflected in CMS for me, and I rechecked to make sure those were the only problems i got wrong, and they were. Possibly a glitch?
