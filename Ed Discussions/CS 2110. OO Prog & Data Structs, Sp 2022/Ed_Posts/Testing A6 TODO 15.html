  When I make my file that I'm saving my scores to read only, or preventing from further editing on my Mac, and then try to save a score to that file, it still saves the score to the file and it seems as if the file by itself becomes editable again. Not sure what is going wrong in my code.

  Nah, not possible.  Either you didn't actually make the file read only, or the way you are going about observing the contents of the file is wrong...

  Is the only way to make the file read-only by preventing editing?
