 I am trying to develop some helper methods and I am running into something that I thought I'd raise a question about:
 <break>
 </break>
 <break>
 </break>
 In
 <b>
  flee()
 </b>
 , if we try to return ANYTHING at ANY POINT (i.e I want to return a Node with a helper function called within
 <b>
  flee()
 </b>
 ), will it interpret that return as "returning" from the
 <b>
  flee()
 </b>
 method itself, therefore causing an error to occur if the return doesn't happen at the exit?
</p>

  Nevermind; I realized that methods I thought were running multiple times only ran once, therefore the program stopped before I wanted it to!
