  I am trying to develop some helper methods and I am running into something that I thought I'd raise a question about:
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  In
  <bold>
   flee()
  </bold>
  , if we try to return ANYTHING at ANY POINT (i.e I want to return a Node with a helper function called within
  <bold>
   flee()
  </bold>
  ), will it interpret that return as "returning" from the
  <bold>
   flee()
  </bold>
  method itself, therefore causing an error to occur if the return doesn't happen at the exit?

  Nevermind; I realized that methods I thought were running multiple times only ran once, therefore the program stopped before I wanted it to!
