 Cornell Rocketry's Business Team is recruiting this semester! CRT's business team is pivotal to the operation of the rocket. On the business team, you will be involved with social media, marketing, sponsorship outreach, financial tracking, website development, and many other key team operations. CRT loves to include business in building the rocket, and as a business team member you would have the opportunity to work on composite shifts as we prepare for our launch in March! We have an inclusive, vibrant team culture and would love for you to apply!! All majors are encouraged to apply and no experience is necessary. We look forward to reading your applications!
