  I am confused on how these outputs occured.  Also I don't understand how whether the parameter shadows a static variable or local variable doesn't change where the reference is.

  The only way to get over the confusion is to execute the sequence of statements carefully, using all the rules that were given to you. Thus, for the statement  c= new C1(), actually draw variable c, draw the new object of class C, and put a ptr to it in variable c.
