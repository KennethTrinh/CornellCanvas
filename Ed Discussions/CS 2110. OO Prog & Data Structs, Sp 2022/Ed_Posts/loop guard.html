 WE're confused about how to write the loop guard. It says to continue the loop while the frontier set is not empty. But we have a hashmap that contains both nodes in the frontier set and settled set. So how should we check if the frontier set is empty? Is there some method or field that we can use to distinguish between nodes in the settled set and nodes in the frontier set

  Just check if frontier heap is empty. The while loop ends if the size is of the heap is 0. Use .size()

   Do we have a heap for the settled set too? The abstract method on the handout tells us to remove f from F and add it to S. I removed it from F using poll but do I need to add it anywhere?

    SandF includes the settled set. You donâ€™t need to add f directly to SandF

     Hi, so when you say we do not need to add f directly to SandF, what are we supposed to do with f when we poll it from F? Because the abstract algorithm says to add it in S which I'm assuming will be SandF in the code. I'm sorry I'm just confused, thanks.

      Remember that the map SandF contains the frontier set AND the settled set. So there's actually no "moving" of anything from F to S in terms of the map. If you have more follow-up questions, let's talk in a separate thread!
