 How to account for the month in gotBefore method without using a conditional to tell whether the year is the same first? Instruction pdf says whole method should be done in a single return statement, so impossible to create a double that combines month and year and then compare those two? Should the month just be disregarded?
</p>

  Think about it like this, you either check if the year is different (one is greater than the other) OR the year is the same AND you want to check for whether the month is before or not.

  Something I recommend is using/writing it in english first before writing the code.

   Do NOT concrete a double. Write out in English when (d1, m1) comes before (d2, m2).
  </p>
  <p>
   Then translate that into a boolean expression.
