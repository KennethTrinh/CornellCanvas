 I had a question about the second PhD constructor - the one with five arguments.
</p>
<p>
 The constructor has to assign values to all fields. For the number of advisees, I said that it would be 0, same as the first PhD constructor (for the first one, it was mentioned in the Javadoc specification that the instance should have 0 advisors).
</p>
<p>
 Is this correct? I just wanted to double-check.

  Yes this is correct. Make sure that the class invariant is kept true by every method.
