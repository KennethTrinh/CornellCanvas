  I meant like
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  (Type PhD). The first PhD advisor of this person —null if unknown. ‣ (Type PhD). The second advisor of this person —null if unknown or if the person has less than two advisors.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  and not
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  (Type String). Name of the person with a PhD, a String of length &gt; 1 in the instructions

  In the structure of this assignment, we want the advisor to be a PhD because PhD has information such as the number of advisees. As a result, we want to include this information in the object that is "linked" to a PhD as its advisor instead of just the name of the advisor. By using a PhD object we can include not just the name but all the other information we get from the rest of the PhD fields.

  Like I said to be an advisor you must be a PhD object, the javadoc is correct. How are you the advisor of someone who’s getting a PhD when you don’t have a PhD yourself, this is also because if you’re someone’s advisor that means you have at least one advisee, a string doesn’t have the field advisee whereas PhD does
