  In the already written methods, I see the line
 </paragraph>
 <pre>CovidTree dt 
</pre>
 <paragraph>
  used several times.  Is "dt" a local variable, or is it another way of saying "this" in the method body?
 </paragraph>

  thanks!

  It’s not a way to say “this”. The only way to say "this" is by using the keyword. dt is just a local variable that points to a CovidTree. “dt” is just a name, there’s nothing special about it. It’s often used as  loop variable. Often, it’s like this: for(CovidTree dt:children){…} This is just iterating over the children. Since children is a Set, you can’t loop over indices, so you have to loop this way. The dt points to one child in one iteration, and then it points to the next child. It does that until there are no children left.
