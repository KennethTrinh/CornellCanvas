 Is this asking whether (Quicksort can be done using constant space) AND (Quicksort is stable)
</p>
<p>
 Or (Quicksort can be done using constant space) AND (When quick sorting with constant space, it is stable)
</p>

  This is of the form A and B, it is true if (1) Quicksort can be done with constant space AND (1) quicksort is stable. The answer is false because quicksort is inherently unstable.
