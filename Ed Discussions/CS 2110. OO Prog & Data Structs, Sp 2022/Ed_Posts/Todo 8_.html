 Hello!
</p>
<p>
 In todo 8, the function mousepressed specification needs us to modify the observers once the target is hit. I am confused about what exactly that means and why do we need to update listeners, as I thought they are always active?

  Listeners certainly are listening. But an event has to occur for them to have anything to hear.  So the question is: what event needs to occur?  The answer is hinted at by the comment in TODO 8.  It tells you to call a method.  What is the specification of that method?  How does it relate to your question?  That is what you should investigate next.

    TODO 8 tells you to call
    <code>
     setScore
    </code>
    .  That method was provided for you.  Its specification says it notifies observers.  Only one line of it, the last, is at all interesting.  That is the line that notifies observers.
