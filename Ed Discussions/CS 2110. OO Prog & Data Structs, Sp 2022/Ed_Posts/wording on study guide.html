  I'm confused on this from the final study guide:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  "Know that if a Collection or one of its subinterfaces/subclasses implements interface Iterable, the foreach statement can be used to iterate over such collections."
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I think I am misunderstanding this. I thought that if a subinterface/subclass implemented something, its superclass wouldn't be affected, so why would implementing Iterable allow a superclass (the Collection) to be able to use the foreach statement?
