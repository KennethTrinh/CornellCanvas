  On the CMS video there's these examples:

 </figure>
 <paragraph>
  and the answers:
 </paragraph>
 <blockquote>
  s= s + k–1; k= k–1;
  <bold>
   OR
  </bold>
  k= k–1; s= s + k
 </blockquote>
 <blockquote>
  v= Math.min(v, b[k+1]); k= k+1;
  <bold>
   OR
  </bold>
  k= k+1; v= Math.min(v, b[k])
 </blockquote>
 <paragraph>
  1) Is the order of s and k being stated important?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2) how/why does the order of s and k being stated change the answer slightly?

  Yes, the order of s and k matters. For example, let s = 0 and k = 1. If we had the order: s = s + k-1; k=k-1;, s would become 0 and k would become 0. If we reverse the order, and have k=k-1; s = s + k-1;, k becomes 0 and s becomes -1 as k has already been decremented in the previous statement.

  Each assignment statement is one after the other, so any changes to one variable will remain for the second statement.
