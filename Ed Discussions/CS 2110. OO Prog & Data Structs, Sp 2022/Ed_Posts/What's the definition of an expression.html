  The information about expression shown on the JavaHyperText is below, but I don't see any definition for an expression. Can I just see it as a line of code? Do we use an expression to represent a line of code?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  JavaHyperText:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  "In Java, each expression has a type, which depends on the type of its operations and operands. Evaluation of the expression yields a value of that type."

  An expression is not a line of code. Think of it like a mathematical expression that can be evaluated to some value except not all expressions are numerical expressions.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For example, "hello" + "world" is an expression
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  and 'c' + 5 is also an expression
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  and 56 + x is also an expression where x is a variable of type int.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  And in the assignment statement   x= y;
  <break>
  </break>
  the righthand side  y  is an expression.
