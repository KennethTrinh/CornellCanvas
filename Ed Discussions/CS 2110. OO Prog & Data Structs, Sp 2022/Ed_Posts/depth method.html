 I am trying to figure out how to return -1 if p is not in the tree without using any if statement, do you have any hints? I am not sure how the variable that stores depth will ever equal -1 if we only need one base case for if human equals p.

 <p>
  There is a base case, right? the root contains p.
 </p>
 <p>
  That is the only base case you need.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the recursive case, you have a loop that iterates through the children, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  This is a searching method. And the body of the loop will return under certain conditions.
 </p>
 <p>
  After the loop, return -1, because none of the iterations for each child returned.
 </p>
 <p>
  LOOK AT THE PATTERN WE GAVE YOU FOR A SEARCHING METHOD.
