 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 I have three questions on content from the past few weeks.
</p>
<p>
 1) What is the difference between equals and equivalence? How does referential relate to these two concepts? Do you have to cast objects to the same type before comparing them for either equality or equivalence?
</p>
<p>
 2) Can you reference subclass fields of an object after you cast the object to its superclass?
</p>
<p>
 3) Does int var = 5; point to the memory location that stores 5 or something else? Does Integer obj = new Integer(5); point to the location of an object?
</p>
<p>
 Thanks so much!

   Hi,
  </p>
  <p>
   Sorry about that! Thanks for letting me know.
  </p>
  <p>
   Now that the quiz is over I wanted to follow up on these questions and ask a few more.
  </p>
  <p>
   Original questions:
  </p>
  <p>
   1) What is the difference between equals and equivalence? How does referential relate to these two concepts? Do you have to cast objects to the same type before comparing them for either equality or equivalence?
  </p>
  <p>
   2) Can you reference subclass fields of an object after you cast the object to its superclass?
  </p>
  <p>
   3) Does int var = 5; point to the memory location that stores 5 or something else? Does Integer obj = new Integer(5); point to the location of an object?
  </p>
  <p>
   New questions:
  </p>
  <p>
   4) Say Class B extends Class A and Implements C1 and C1. Say C1 v = new C1();. Can you cast v directly to class A by doing (A) v or would you have to cast to class B and then to class A by doing (A) (B) v?
  </p>
  <p>
   5) My understanding is that when you call a method defined in a superclass on an object in a subclass, there is an automatic cast up on the object to run that method, however, after the method is run, the object reverts back to its original cast. Is this correct?
  </p>
  <p>
   6) When shown a diagram of an object with the following hierarchy: Object--&gt; animal--&gt;cat, is the class of the object cat?
  </p>
  <p>
   Thanks so much!
