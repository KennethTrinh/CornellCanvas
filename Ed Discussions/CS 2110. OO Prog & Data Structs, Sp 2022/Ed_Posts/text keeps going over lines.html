  Whenever I save my code, Eclipse automatically reformats my lines to go past the 100 line width limit like this:

  Does anyone know why this could be?

  I think multiple people have been having this problem. I am pretty sure going over the line by the amount you showed should be fine. At least according to: #247

  My actual code (which I did not show here) goes way over the line though, and this is an issue I have been having when I worked on A2.
