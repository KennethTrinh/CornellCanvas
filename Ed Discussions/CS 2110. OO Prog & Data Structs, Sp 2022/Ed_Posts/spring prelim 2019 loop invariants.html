  why do you not add 1 to m when you are b[m].inGates(). I understand why yo subtract 1 from t but why would you not also increment m like you do in b[m}.inStatler()

  Because you swapped what was at t-1 with m, so now the element at b[m] is unknown again (because what was at b[t-1] was unknown) so we can’t increment it cos we don’t know what’s there
