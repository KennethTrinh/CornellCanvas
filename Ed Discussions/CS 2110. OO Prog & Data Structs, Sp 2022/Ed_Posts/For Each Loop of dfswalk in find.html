  I am stuck on how to write the beginning of the basic for each loop for the dfswalk in the find() method. I think I need to get the ID of the NodeStatus object as a long, which I know is a method/field in NodeStatus, but I am struggling to figure out how to do that. After that, I know I want to loop through the neighbors.

  You can use currentLoc() to find the id for the node in the current location. Use getId() on other NodeStatus objects to get the Id.

  Please be sure you start with the method given in the tutorial on the pdfs walk --you need a specification like the one there, changed to fit this environment, and the method body should be changed to fit the new circumstances
