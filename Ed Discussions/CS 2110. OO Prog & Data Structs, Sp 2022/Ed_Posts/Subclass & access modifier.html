 If a subclass is in the same package as its superclass, can the object of the subclass access components of the superclasses which has a "package" access modifier?

  Yes. If the components of the superclass have package/no modifier, then any class within the same package can access those components, even if they weren't a subclass. Typing
  <code>
   modifier
  </code>
  into JavaHyperText comes up with nice a table illustrating the accessibility levels for reference!
