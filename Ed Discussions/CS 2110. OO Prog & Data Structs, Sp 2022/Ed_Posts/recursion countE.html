<p>
 hello,
</p>
<p>
 besides using a condition expression for the recursive case to get either one for 0(depending on if the first index is 'e' or not)
</p>
<p>
 I originally had 2 base cases, return 0 if empty and 1 if first index is 'e', how would I be able to write my recursive case, if I approached it this way instead of a conditional expression.
</p>

  If I pass a string such as "elephant" to the method that you are writing. Your second base case that returns 1 if the first index is 'e' will essentially make your recursive case unreachable. The method will return 1 before getting to the part of the function that will call itself on the substring of "elephant".

   You don't need a conditional expression.
  </p>
  <p>
   Instead, use an if-statement instead, handling the two cases.
  </p>
  <p>
   You don't need the special case of a string of length 1.

    I see, I was returning 0 or 1 based off the if statements, which caused it not to work. Instead creating the variable to store those values to worked. Thanks
