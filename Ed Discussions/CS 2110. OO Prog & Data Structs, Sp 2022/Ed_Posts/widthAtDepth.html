  If the tree has a maximum depth of 5, how many nodes are there on depth 6?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  That is the answer to be produced.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  But do NOT write code to deal with this as a special case.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Just write the recursive method without worrying about it. If it is correct, it will work properly even if the depth at node 10 is required and the max depth is 1.
