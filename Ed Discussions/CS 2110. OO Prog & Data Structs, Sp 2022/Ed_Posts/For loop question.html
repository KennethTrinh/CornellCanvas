 Hello,
</p>
<p>
 I was wondering-- is it possible to initialize a for loop with two iterative variables? For example, if we wanted both an index i and an index j in a list to compare or swap two of its variables. I tried to insert a picture of what I am talking about below, but sorry if it didn't turn out:
 <break>
 </break>

<p>
 I think we could probably use a while loop and initialize i and j within the loop body, but I was just wondering if it was possible to do this with a for loop as well.
</p>
<p>
 Thank you!

   I don't think that is possible. You could use a for loop to do the swapping example you mentioned with just index i though. You just have to set
   <code>
    j= arr.length - (i+1)
   </code>
   at every iteration.
