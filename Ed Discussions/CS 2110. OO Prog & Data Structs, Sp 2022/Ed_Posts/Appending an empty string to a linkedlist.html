  Hello!

  When you append an empty string "" to an existing linkedlist, are we technically not supposed to append anything? Or do we still append the empty string to the linkedlist and increase the size of the list by 1? There was no precondition saying whether v could not be the empty string or not, but I was just curious on what we want to actually happen.

  Good thinking. Yes, this special case is a good one to test.

  Please look at the last line of the specification of toString() for that example.

  Yes, of course the size has to be incremented.
