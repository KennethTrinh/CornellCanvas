  Use whatever operating system you want. The important point is that you install and use Java and Eclipse, as indicated on the Canvas course webpage.

  One of the strengths of the Java ecosystem is its cross-platform compatibility, so any PC operating system should be fine (it does need to have a graphical desktop, both for Eclipse and for some later assignments). As for the course materials, the majority are web pages, online video, and PDFs, so they should be accessible from all operating systems as well. Now if you want to step through our PowerPoint animations on your own, you might have better luck with Windows or Mac, but the static slide content is also available in PDF form.

    Our "AutoHelper" (a service that checks your assignment submissions for common errors, IF you get an early start) runs Linux.

  If you go to office hours for help with a technical issue related to your computer, fewer TAs may be able to help you if you're on Linux. That's about the only downside - we've seen many students run Eclipse and Java on Linux with no problems.
