<p>
 hello, would it be possible to unlock the Panopto Lecture 18: Graphs for those who would like to view it? When clicking the link, it says that the viewer has to request access to view the lectures.
</p>
<p>
 Thank you!
</p>

  Which page are you stuck on? Is it the Panopto site? I'm able to play the videos fine.

   Hi Andrew!
  </p>
  <p>
   I've tested all the other Panopto lectures and it seems the only one that is locked is the Lecture 19 Graphs: Traversals. I've attached a picture for your convenience.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cheers!

    Hm, not sure why that is. From what I see it looks like it's shared with everyone. Are you sure you're signed into your Cornell account?
