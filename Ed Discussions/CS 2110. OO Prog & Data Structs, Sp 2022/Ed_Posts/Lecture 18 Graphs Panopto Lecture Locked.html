  hello, would it be possible to unlock the Panopto Lecture 18: Graphs for those who would like to view it? When clicking the link, it says that the viewer has to request access to view the lectures.

  Which page are you stuck on? Is it the Panopto site? I'm able to play the videos fine.

  Hi Andrew!

 <paragraph>
  I've tested all the other Panopto lectures and it seems the only one that is locked is the Lecture 19 Graphs: Traversals. I've attached a picture for your convenience.

  Hm, not sure why that is. From what I see it looks like it's shared with everyone. Are you sure you're signed into your Cornell account?
