  There's little chance for inefficiencies in PhD.java since everything you write is an assignment statement or a return statement or perhaps a call on another method, basically. No loops, no recursion, etc.

   Not usually, unless explicitly stated in the guidelines given. It also depends on what you mean by “inefficient.” If you are concerned about some specific block of code being inefficient, you can ask about it.
