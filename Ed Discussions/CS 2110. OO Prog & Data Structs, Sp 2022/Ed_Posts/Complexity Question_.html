 For this question I thought it would be O(n*k).  I am confused why it would only be m or k because searching could lead to at worst case n paths being followed.  I am confused why n doesn't come into play for the answer.

  Think of what happens at each iteration.

 <p>
  At the first iteration, in constant time, you find out whether the letter the word starts with is a child of the root. If so,

 <p>
  At the second iteration, in constant time, you find out whether the second letter the word starts with a child of a child of the root. And so on.
 </p>

  Progressing down to one more level of the takes constant time.

 <p>
  (1) No more than the number k of letters in the word your searching for,  and
 </p>
 <p>
  (2) No more than the depth of the tree, which is m.
