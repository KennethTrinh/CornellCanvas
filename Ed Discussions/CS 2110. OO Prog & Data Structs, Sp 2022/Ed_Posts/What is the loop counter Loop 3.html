 Can we use another variable other than n or m, if it is the first part of the for loop?

  Please don't use any extra variables. Think about what the problem is asking you to do and how you can use the arguments provided to do this. The loop counter is the value you declare to keep track of the point you are in a loop specifically for a for-loop. Search
  <code>
   for
  </code>
  in the JavaHyperText.
