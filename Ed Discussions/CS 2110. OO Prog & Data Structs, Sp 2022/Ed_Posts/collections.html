 I am having trouble sorting a collections list of nodeStatus objects for find(). you can't access an element at a specific index which means 2 different nodeStatus objects can not be compared with the compareTo method. I tried implementing insertion sort but this did not work either because an element at a specific position in the arrayList can not be accessed either.
