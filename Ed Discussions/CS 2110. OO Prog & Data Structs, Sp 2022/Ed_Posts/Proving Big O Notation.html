 When proving Big O Notation can we use limits, and talk about how as n gets bigger, the n with the higher exponent will make the most impact on the expression. Therefore, that is why we are most concerned with the n with the higher exponent and the constant also doesn't matter.

  No, you cannot use limits. You must use the method taught in lecture.
