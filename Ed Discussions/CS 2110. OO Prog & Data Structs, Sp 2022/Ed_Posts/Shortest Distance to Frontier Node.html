  I am confused on how to find the shortest distance between the settled nodes and frontier nodes. Do I need to make a separate loop inside the main loop?

  Look at the abstract algorithm and simply translate it into Java, using the two data structures (Heap and HashMap). I don't know what you mean by "shortest distance between the settled and frontier nodes", why you are looking at that.

  Did you read the theorem we proved about the loop invariant? Do you understand it? If not, stop and study the invariant and the theorem,.
