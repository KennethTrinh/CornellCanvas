  Let's say we have function Call p(5,2,3)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  and the function definition is public boolean p(x,y,z){
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  .....
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  .....
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  some more lines of code.... }
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  the call p(5,2,3) first pops the call onto the call stack it then assigns x to 5, y to 2 and z to 3, as its first thing when called and any other local variables, then it executes the method body. After that the call is popped off the stack and left on top is our return value.
