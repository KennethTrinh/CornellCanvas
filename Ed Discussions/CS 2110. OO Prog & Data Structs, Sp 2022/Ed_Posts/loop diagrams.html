<p>
 So I'm a little confused about how this diagram works.
</p>
<p>
 The array has k drawn before the last element, so b[k] is the last element in the array, not b[k-1]. So I assume if the variable is before the line, the line indicates b[that variable].
</p>
<p>
 Then why is 0 after the beginning, shouldn't the line indicating b[0] be after the positioning of 0 then? And I get that b[0...h-1] is the first section since the line is before h, so why is the second section b[j+1...k], the line is immediately after j so shouldn't that line be representing b[j]?
</p>
<p>
 Any help is greatly appreciated!
</p>

  1. b[k] is NOT the last element in the array. This is NOT processing the whole array, just the segment b[0..k].
 </p>
 <p>
  2. If the ? section is empty, then the &lt;= 0 section can be written as b[0..h-1] OR b[0..j].

   I guess I get that, but how would you differentiate (in the above diagram) the last part of the invariant being b[j+1...k] &gt; 0 vs. b[j..k] &gt; 0? Like I guess what's a steadfast rule for interpreting the positioning of the line before/after the variable names?
