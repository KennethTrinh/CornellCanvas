  Are we assuming that it's empty because it is unknown? And why do we say b[h..j] = b[0..k], is it because it's b[0..k] is unknown as well, therefore it's empty and since h..j is in the range 0..k we can also conclude b[h..j] is empty?

  This is the initial condition, so at the point at the beginning of the loop, we don't know anything about the array, so the entire array is in the question-mark region. You can think of it as initializing h and j in the invariant so that the invariant looks like the precondition.

  It has nothing to do with "unknown".

  You want the loop to stop when b[h..j] is empty. That section has this many elements in it: j+1-h. Therefore, when j+1-h = 0, the section is empty. That is, when h = j+1.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Does that make sense to you?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If h = j+1, then b[0..h-1] &lt;= 0. and b[h..k] &gt;= 0.

  How do we know we want the loop to stop when b[h..j] is empty, Is that because of R?
