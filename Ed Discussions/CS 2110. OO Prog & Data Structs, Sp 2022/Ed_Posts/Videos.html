 Are we assuming that it's empty because it is unknown? And why do we say b[h..j] = b[0..k], is it because it's b[0..k] is unknown as well, therefore it's empty and since h..j is in the range 0..k we can also conclude b[h..j] is empty?

  It has nothing to do with "unknown".
 </p>
 <p>
  You want the loop to stop when b[h..j] is empty. That section has this many elements in it: j+1-h. Therefore, when j+1-h = 0, the section is empty. That is, when h = j+1.
 </p>
 <p>
  Does that make sense to you?
 </p>
 <p>
  If h = j+1, then b[0..h-1] &lt;= 0. and b[h..k] &gt;= 0.

   How do we know we want the loop to stop when b[h..j] is empty, Is that because of R?

   This is the initial condition, so at the point at the beginning of the loop, we don't know anything about the array, so the entire array is in the question-mark region. You can think of it as initializing h and j in the invariant so that the invariant looks like the precondition.
