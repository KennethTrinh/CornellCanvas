 when you poll() a heap, the root value is removed and returned. That means the size of the heap decreased by one and there is an additional  ? or empty space in the array, right?
</p>
<p>
 Lets say the min-heap is in array b [0,1,3, 2,3]. If poll() is called on this heap, then array b is b[1,2,3,3,?]  and the value 0 is returned, right?

  Look carefully at the lecture slides and JavaHyperText.
 </p>
 <p>
  When the root is placed in a local variable, the last value in the heap is placed in the root and bubbled down.

   Yes. But when talking about before bubbling down, the deletion of the root node from the heap is reflected in the array right?

    The array is just how the heap is stored, so anything that happens in the heap is reflected in the array.
