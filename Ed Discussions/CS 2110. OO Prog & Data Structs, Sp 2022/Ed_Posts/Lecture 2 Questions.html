 In this example, after running c.m(3,4), does c.x refer to the variable x, and not parameter x?  (Since, parameter x still holds the value 3.)  And then in terms, of the Inside Out rule, we look at the field variables, and then the parameter variables in the order they were initialized within the program run?
