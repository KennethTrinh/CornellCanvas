 Hi there!
</p>
<p>
 Our course project is looking for Juniors and Seniors who are preparing for technical interviews of any kind (software engineering, data scientist, data engineers, data analysts, etc.) to conduct user interviews (about
 <b>
  15 - 20 minutes on Zoom
 </b>
 ). Our goal is to create a product to help our user group prepare for those interviews. We'll buy you a cup of coffee or bubble-tea as a thank-you!
