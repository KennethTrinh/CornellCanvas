  Do we need to make assert statements for types? For example, asserting that an argument passed in is a string.

  No, when declaring a variable in java it has a type already so it doesnâ€™t need to be asserted, if they use a wrong type java will cry to the user

  Look at the declaration of a field, like
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  int month;
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  of a call
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  comesBefore(PhD p) { ... }
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  They type is given month and p is given in its declaration. Java will not allow a value of another type to be stored in month and p.
