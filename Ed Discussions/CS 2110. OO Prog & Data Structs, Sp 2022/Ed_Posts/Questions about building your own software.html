  Today I
  <link href="https://canvas.cornell.edu/courses/35735/pages/lecture-26-software-engineering"/>
  talked about software engineering through the lens of ideas that would be useful in building your own software in the near future.  I'll finish that discussion on Thursday.

  Is the incremental development model more aligned with the Waterfall Development Model or the Agile Development Model? Or is it its own completely separate model?

  Hopefully the extra slide I started with today (with the Venn diagram) answered this question!

  A fellow Java programmer and I are planning to build a web application that we believe could scale into a business over the summer. We each have experience working alone on projects like this, but have never followed or even heard of the frameworks you talked about.

  Certainly waterfall isn't right for a small project like this, but is Xtreme programming even too formal? We really like the idea of user stories for example, but are hesitant to pair program or unit test because of the time crunch. Our desire is to build the the minimum viable product of our idea in as short a time as possible. So exactly how much unit testing, formalizing plans, etc., is advisable? Since we can see this scaling into a business, what tradeoff would you make between sustainability and being able to quickly build an application in our situation?

  Hopefully what I mentioned today about adopting XP practices independently helped to answer this question!  User stories are great to use in your situation.  Pair programming is useful if you get stuck or need help.  Unit testing is

   always

  desirable even if you are unit testing only 30% of the code, not 100%!
