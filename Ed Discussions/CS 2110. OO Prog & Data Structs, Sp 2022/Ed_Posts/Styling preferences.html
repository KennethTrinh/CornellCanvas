 The automatic formatting works for the files that I create but doesn't work for the file that I have downloaded for the recitation. Can anyone help me?

  You probably didn't open the file in your workspace. You need to import the file into a new project inside your workspace and work from there

   How do I import a file into a project?
  </p>
  <p>
   Edit: I dragged it into a new project but the styling preferences don't take place. However, in a different file they do when I save the file.
