  "If W is an interface, the declaration W e; is illegal."
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  This is false. Why is that? Interfaces can't be initiated right?

  Yes,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  W e. is legal.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Suppose we have
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  class C implements I1;
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Then I1 e= (I1) (new C(...));
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  is fine.

  And to clarify, W e is not
  <bold>
   initializing
  </bold>
  an instance of type W. It is just
  <bold>
   declaring
  </bold>
  a variable of type W.

  isn’t the variable e in the professors example upcasted to I1 though? If i’m not wrong does that make e an instance of I1 or does upcasting with interfaces work different

  It's still an instance of C. The dynamic type is C. The static type is I1 because that's what we declared it as. Upcasting here is implicit actually, so the (I1) was extra.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I1 e= new C(...);
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  would have done the same thing.
