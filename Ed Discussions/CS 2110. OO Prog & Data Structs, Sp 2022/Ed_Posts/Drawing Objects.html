 Hi team,
</p>
<p>
 Suppose you have a variable b at runtime which has a dynamic type of "Account"
</p>
<p>
 If you explicitly downcast "Account" to one of it's subclasses "InterestAccount"
</p>
<p>
 Does the dynamic type of variable b change to "InterestAccount" and is the pointer pointing to the "InterestAccount" part of the partition?
</p>
<p>
 Thanks!
</p>

  Depends on how variable b was initialized and how it ended up as Account.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the declaration of variable b was just
 </p>
 <p>
  Account b = new Account(..);
 </p>
 <p>
  then you downcasted you'd get an error,
 </p>
 <p>
  however,
 </p>
 <p>
  if you did
 </p>
 <p>
  Account b = new IAccount(...);
 </p>
 <p>
  then downcasted you would not get an error.
 </p>

   You can only explicitly downcast if it was originally declared from a lower partition.
  </p>
  <p>
   Makes sense thank you!
