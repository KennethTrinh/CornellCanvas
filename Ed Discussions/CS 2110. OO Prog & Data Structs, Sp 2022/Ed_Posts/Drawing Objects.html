  Hi team,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Suppose you have a variable b at runtime which has a dynamic type of "Account"
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If you explicitly downcast "Account" to one of it's subclasses "InterestAccount"
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Does the dynamic type of variable b change to "InterestAccount" and is the pointer pointing to the "InterestAccount" part of the partition?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thanks!

  Depends on how variable b was initialized and how it ended up as Account.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If the declaration of variable b was just
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Account b = new Account(..);
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  then you downcasted you'd get an error,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  however,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  if you did
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Account b = new IAccount(...);
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  then downcasted you would not get an error.

  You can only explicitly downcast if it was originally declared from a lower partition.

  Makes sense thank you!
