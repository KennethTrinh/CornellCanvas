 When we use the observer methods during testing, everything works but we can't see the returned values for the observer methods on the screen. How do we get that to happen?

  Do you mean that you cannot see the values returned printed to the console?

  If your tests passed, that means the observer methods returned the values you put as your expected values for your
  <code>
   assertEquals
  </code>
  statements. If you want to see values printed to the console (such as for debugging purposes) you would need to use
  <code>
   System.out.println(...)
  </code>
  .
