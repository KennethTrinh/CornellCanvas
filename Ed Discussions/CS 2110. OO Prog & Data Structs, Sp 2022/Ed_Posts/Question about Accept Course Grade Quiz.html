  On Canvas, the quiz, "Accept Course Grade" is listed, and states that we have the option to accept our current course grade by May 14th and not take the final exam. A picture of this is seen below. I don't see this option anywhere in the syllabus or course information and haven't heard anything about it besides this quiz.

  The dates in the Instructions of the quiz are for last semester, so does this mean it was only an option then? Or is this an option we have now?
