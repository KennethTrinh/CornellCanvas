 Hello!
</p>
<p>
 I saw on someone else's post that it is okay to use indexof () but we currently have it in our program used twice. We are using indexof() and lasindexof() which is kind of different but the worst case remains the same. We are not sure if that is efficient and what we can do to make it more efficient
</p>

 Sorry for making this post private! I wasn't sure if it was okay to mention specific parts of my code on ed. I can make it anonymous if you would like.

  It's OK to use indexOf and lastIndexOf.
