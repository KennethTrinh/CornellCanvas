  The definition I found for balanced is "A balanced binary tree is defined as
  <bold>
   a binary tree in which the height of the left and right subtree of any node differ by not more than 1
  </bold>
  ."
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If nodes b and l were removed, it would still not be balanced. This is because the left and right subtree height of node m does not differ by at most 1.
