 My dot completely disappears when I put the size slider all the way down. Is this an issue and if so how should I go about fixing it.

  According to the provided code, the minimum value of that slider is 1, hence the minimum radius of the target is 1.  A circle of radius 1 should certainly be visible, though perhaps hard-to-spot.  Worth considering whether you are just missing it, or whether you are drawing the target at its correct size.
