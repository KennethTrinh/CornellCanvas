  For this question, why do we need to cast ob to be Restaurant object? Don't we already check that it's of the Restaurant class in the if statement?

  Compile time reference rule, write equals into java hyper text and read more on it, long story short, ob's static type is object which doesn't have a name field so doing ob.name would not compile.
