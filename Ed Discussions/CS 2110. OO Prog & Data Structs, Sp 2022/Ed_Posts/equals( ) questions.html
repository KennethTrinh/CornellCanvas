 To check the 3rd condition "their children sets are equal", I am thinking that my for loop should start with for (CovidTree t1 :
 <i>
  current CovidTree object s1
 </i>
 ) to loop over every covid tree t1 in s1. But I wasn't sure about how to reference the
 <i>
  current CovidTree object s1
 </i>
 .
</p>
<p>
 Also, does the helper isInSet(CovidTree t, Set&lt;CovidTree&gt; s) just loop over each child in s and return true if it finds a child that is equal to t?

  1. The helper method has to do what its specification says! That is all. We should not have to explain HOW that works.
 </p>
 <p>
  2.For the third condition, do what you think is right!
