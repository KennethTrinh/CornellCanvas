  To check the 3rd condition "their children sets are equal", I am thinking that my for loop should start with for (CovidTree t1 :
  <italic>
   current CovidTree object s1
  </italic>
  ) to loop over every covid tree t1 in s1. But I wasn't sure about how to reference the
  <italic>
   current CovidTree object s1
  </italic>
  .

 <paragraph>
  Also, does the helper isInSet(CovidTree t, Set&lt;CovidTree&gt; s) just loop over each child in s and return true if it finds a child that is equal to t?

  1. The helper method has to do what its specification says! That is all. We should not have to explain HOW that works.

  2.For the third condition, do what you think is right!
