 I noticed that in the lecture the bipartite graph with 4 nodes on the left and 4 nodes on the right could have the worst coloring case of 4 colors with a best of 2. However, I do not understand how it gets the 4. Because if you choose a node A and then iterate through its neighbor it'll always get you 2. Therefore, I was wondering how the coloring algorithm iterates through its node. And what would be the best coloring algorithm (like if we made it assign colors through BFS or DFS would it be the best coloring?)

  In the coloring algorithm we gave, there is no notion of "iterating through neighbors". Go bak to the slide, it shows you the order in which the nodes are colored.

   if the iteration was through BFS or DFS, would that be the most efficient coloring scheme?
