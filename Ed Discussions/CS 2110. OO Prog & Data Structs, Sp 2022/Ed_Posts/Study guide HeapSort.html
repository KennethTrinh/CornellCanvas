 Hi there,
</p>
<p>
 In study guide we are given this heapsort algorithm
</p>

</figure>
<p>
 However, I was wondering for the exam if we should also know the following 2 things about heap sort (which is left out in this algorithm):
</p>
<p>
 1. It doesn't include step 1 of HeapSort: to make a array into a max-heap in place (as shown below)
</p>

<p>
 2. It fails to include k = k -1 which would maintain the invariant that the poll value (the largest value) is being pushed into the sorted section "b[k+1...] is sorted"

  You have to know heapsort.
 </p>
 <p>
  Both steps.
 </p>
 <p>
  Look at your first thing. The first thing is says is
 </p>
 <p>
  Make b into a heap (with the largest value at the root.
 </p>
 <p>
  That steps is not implement in that version; it is just given at a high level like that.
