  What is the most effective way for us to work with a partner such that both parties share an equal responsibility in completing the assignment? Is it best to allocate time to work on the assignments together with your partner? Should the work be evenly divided between the two partners? Any other tips so that both partners are learning when completing the assignments.

  I believe the most effective way to work with a partner is working on the assignments together. Whether that means setting up a zoom call and sharing screen or meeting in person, it is important both partners understand every part of the assignment. I do not recommend dividing the assignment in half because then each partner may only understand the few methods they worked on. Note that the entirety of each assignment and its concepts/methods are fair game for exams so you will want to understand them all.

  When I took this class my partner and I would meet up in person and each have our own java project for the assignment. We would then talk through the methods together and code our solutions on our separate versions so we each got the practice of writing out the code. I found this to be extremely helpful in grasping the material but you may find a different approach works best for you! Hope this helps!

  It is against the code of academic integrity to divide the work in half, each doing one half the work, and then combine the two.

  You must work together on the programming assignment, as discussed above.
