 I've went through the DFS walk video but am unsure of how to mark nodes as visited because when I run the game as it is right now, the character gets stuck going back and forth between the same 2 tiles. Any help would be appreciated - thank you!

  Use a data structure to keep track of what nodes have been visited. When you visit a node you can put its id in that data structure. if an id is not in the data structure, the corresponding node is still unvisited.

   You don't know how to mark nodes as visited? Why don't you declare a set variable that contains nodes that are visited? It might have to be IDs, not nodes. Pass that set variable as a parameter of your pdfs walk.
