 Is it correct that one core/CPU can only run one thread at a time? What's the relationship among threads, cores/CPU, and programs like Eclipse? During today's lecture, Professor David showed that Eclipse runs about 80 threads behind the theme. But I don't think Mac has more than 80 cores/CPUs in it. Many thanks!

  Yes, Eclipse may have 80 threads. But your laptop may have only 4 cores. This just means that those 4 cores can run only 4 threads at one time. And your operating system handles this, giving each thread a short amount of time the stopping it and giving another thread some time.
