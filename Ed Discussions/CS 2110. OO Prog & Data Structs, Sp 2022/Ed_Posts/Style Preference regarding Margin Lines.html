  In A0, step 4, we were made to set up a preference setting a print margin column â€” but when saving, Eclipse automatically formats the code to go over the margins. Is there a fix for this/does it matter for formatting/style related points in A1?

  For javadoc comments you can use the &lt;br&gt; tag to break the line. For other things such as code and multi-line comments, if it goes a bit past the line, that's ok.
