 I was going through the past lectures where I saw this hashcode() which was said to be a good hashcode. I am a little confused as to how this can be a good hashcode since it will catgorise objects that are not equal as equal (eg. if an object has x and y value as 3 and 1 and another one has x and y values as 2 and 2 - they are not equal but according to the hashcode they will be?)

  You're correct, that's not a great hash function.
 </p>
 <p>
  1. Where is it said to be good?  I don't see that on that slide.
 </p>
 <p>
  2. Is that slide from this semester?  Which lecture?
