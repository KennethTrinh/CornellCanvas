  Why the second and fourth heaps satisfy the heap invariant? Shouldn't heap be a complete tree but not a perfect tree (cannot fill all node in the deepest level) ?

  The heap can both be complete or almost complete; for the case of 2 and 4 they are both complete. Complete means being filled all the way to the deepest level; incomplete means that the nodes on the final level are still filled from left to right but there can be a node missing on the rightmost part of the heap. (hopefully this makes sense?)
