 I am trying to add more test cases for append/prepend where I test what happens when the list is not empty but I am having trouble creating a new non empty DLList. I have first created an empty DLList of integers, then created a node that I assigned as the head of this new DLList and now I want to change the value of the head of the node.
</p>
<p>
 As I was typing I just realized: can the value of the head be null and still mean that the list is nonempty?

  Adding on, the head of the list being null versus the value of the head being null are two completely separate things. The value of a Node can always be null, just as it can be an Integer (1, 3, 5, etc.). The head being null would indicate that the list is empty, meaning the tail would also be null.
 </p>
 <p>
  So the head and tail are either both null or both non-null.

    Hi, I am trying to create a node object in my test cases but its giving me an error that "Node cannot be resolved to a type". I don't know what I'm missing please help.

     Recall that Node is an inner class only accessible within DLList, so you're not supposed to create any Node objects in your testing file.

      Okay thank you. But how do I then go about creating a non-empty Â ddlist in my test case if I cant directly add to the list?

       You can't create a DLList with nodes already inside it. You can't pass any arguments to the constructor of DLList. The only way to add to the list is by using the methods that you write such as append.

        You CAN add to the list. When we add to the list, we are not adding a Node, but the value.

         In the a4 instructions sheet and in the Inner Classes section of it, it shows you how to obtain the first node of a doubly-linked list and store it so I just copied that. So I used this as the head node of the empty DLList I created before it.
        </p>

   If there is only one node in the list then the head and the tail are both the same node. Even if the value of the only node inside the list is null, the list is still nonempty.
  </p>

   You can't instantiate a DLList with values already inside it because the constructor doesn't take any arguments. You must use a method that puts a node into the list.
