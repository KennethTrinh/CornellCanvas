  Hi I have 2 questions about this insertion sort method body:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1. Why is variable j necessary? Why can't b[i-1] and b[i] be compared for this?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. Why is it swap(j, j-1) instead of swap(b[j], b[j-1])?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thanks!

  1. Note that j changes. If you used i, that would change the for-loop variable.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. It depends on how method swap is defined.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  But what you suggest wouldn't work. The values of the array elements would be passed as arguments. How could the method change the array?
