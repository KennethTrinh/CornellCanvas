 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 Does the child field belong to the Tree or to a specific node? I know it's a hashset, so does it work sort of like a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are the children of those nodes.
</p>
<p>
 Thanks!
</p>

  1. Each object of class CovidTree is a node of the tree.
  <break>
  </break>
  Each object has a field children, which contains the children of the node as a set.
 </p>
 <p>
  2. A HashSet object contains a set of values. It is not a dictionary.

 <p>
  Please read the API documentation for HashSet.
