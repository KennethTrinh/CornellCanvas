  In my insertBefore() method, can I call other methods in the class, like prepend or append? Or is there no need/a better way to do that?

  Thereâ€™s no need to do that. Think about how you can change the previous and next values of a node given a node and use that knowledge to insert a NEW node before a node you already know the previous value to.

  #645 . I think that it is possible that using a previously created method such as prepend or append could be helpful in some edge cases.

  That doesn't cover all cases, better to use case analysis and redo it if it's not the same if it's not repeated code.

  I think that it is possible to run into repeated code through case analysis depending on the implementation. For example, there is one edge case I can think of that does effectively the same action as one of prepend/append. Of course, neither one will cover all cases, but you can still use it.

  Never said it wasn't, but it doesn't cover all cases, but yeah for sure you're right for some of the cases it would be applicable.

  You can use prepend or append if you want.
