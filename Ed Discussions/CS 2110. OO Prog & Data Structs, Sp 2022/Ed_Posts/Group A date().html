  I cannot seem to find any way of combining month and year with "/" to form the desired return. I have tried everything from String.ofValue() to Integer.toString() and nothing seems to work for my JUnit test method. No other function seems to fail in my constructor test if i take out the date() test, but I cannot find any way to combine the int values of month and year to a string return.
