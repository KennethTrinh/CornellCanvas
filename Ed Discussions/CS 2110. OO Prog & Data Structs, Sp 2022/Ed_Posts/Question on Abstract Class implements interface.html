  Is it true that for a normal class that implements an interface, it has to override AND implements all methods but for an abstract class when it implements an interface it doesn’t have to implement all methods in that interface?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  IF so what’s the reason?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  TYSM!

  Since an abstract class can't be instantiated (illegal call), so if it or if it does not implement all methods it does not matter since this is just making a 'blueprint' of a 'blueprint' I guess is a good way to picture it, something I wonder about though (and I'm not sure) is if an abstract class implements an interface and then we create a subclass of that class, I (think?) it has to have all abstract methods in the abstract class as well as all methods in the interface

 <paragraph>
  ^ this is assuming that new subclass isn't an abstract class too

 <paragraph>
  Also yeah your point is true
