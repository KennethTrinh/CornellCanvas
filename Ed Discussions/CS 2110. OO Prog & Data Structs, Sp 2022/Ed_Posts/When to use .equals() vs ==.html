 For example on fall prelim 2019, is it valid to say obR.height.equals(this.height) instead of the solution which is obR.height == height? Or obR.height.equals(height)? Not sure when to use "this" and when not to.

  When you are checking for equality of primitive types, you should use ==. In this case, I'm assuming that height is a float or int, so you should use ==. Using .equals would not work because methods can only be called on objects not primitive types.
 </p>
 <p>
  As for your second question,
  <code>
   this
  </code>
  can be omitted. If you just say height, Java recognizes that you mean this object's height, so you don't have to explicitly say it.

   == checks if they're in the same place in memory (when referring to objects) if referring to primitive types it checks for the same value.
  </p>
  <p>
   .equals checks if the object has the same value (you'd need to write this as a method for your classes)

    Wait isn't .equals() a string method you can use anytime?

     Yes I mean for classes you write, string is a class that's already prewritten

       Also, when you want to compare the equality of two objects, you have to write/define a method for that yourself? It's not built in like for the string equals() method
      </p>

        Someone had to write the equals method for String, but for a class that you write, you have to write the equals method. By default equals is inherited from class Object, and it is equivalent to == (if you don't override the equals method). Using == on objects is simply comparing the memory addresses to see if they are equal, so it tests to see if two objects are literally
        <b>
         the same object
        </b>
        , not just equal.
       </p>
