 I'm a little confused about this statement on the quiz:
</p>
<p>
 This example may help. Consider searching array is c[0..4] for the value that is in c[0].
 <break>
 </break>
 Binary search checks the midpoint at 2 and moves to the lower half of the list. The midpoint of [0, 1] rounds down to 0, and binary search finds the target in 2 comparisons.
</p>
<p>
 Looking at the algorithm in Java HyperText, it says:
</p>
<p>
 k= -1; t= b.length;
</p>
<p>
 // inv: -1 ≤ k &lt; t ≤ b.length and
</p>
<p>
 // b[0..k] ≤ v &lt; b[t..].
</p>
<p>
 while (k != t-1)
</p>
<p>
 { int e= (k+t)/2;
</p>
<p>
 // k &lt; e &lt; t --needed for progress
</p>
<p>
 if (b[e] &lt;= v) k= e;
</p>
<p>
 else t= e; }
</p>
<p>
 So we start with k=-1 and t=5. Then, since the loop condition is true, we have e = (-1 + 5)/2 = 2. We check b[2] with v (which is b[0]), our first comparison, and since b[2] &lt;= b[0] is false, we have t=e, or t=2. Now, we have k=-1 and t=2. Then, since the loop condition is true, we have e = (-1 + 2)/2 = 0. Now, we check b[0] &lt;= v, which is true (they're the same), our second comparison. Thus, we set k = e. Then, we have k=0 and t=2. Since the loop condition is still true, we should be executing the loop again, which makes for at least a third comparison, but the sorting quiz says this is 2. Where am I going wrong here?
