 Hi, method node does not work on
 <i>
  humanA
 </i>
 or any other human; how can we test functions such as contains or covidRouteTo on covid trees within covid trees rather than the entire tree itself?
</p>
<p>
 Thanks!!!!
</p>

  The instructions in a comment in test3contains() says this:
  <break>
  </break>
 </p>
 <p>
  /* We give you ONE test case. You have to put more in. Look at
  <break>
  </break>
  * about line 26 for a discussion of how to do this. You will learn
  <break>
  </break>
  * a lot about how to prepare for testing complicated data structures.*/
 </p>
 <p>
  Did you do that?
 </p>
 <p>
  If you wrote contains properly, there are lots of recursive calls on contains, which are calling contains in subtrees. These calls are also being checked! Because if they down't work, contains in the root won't work. So you don't have to be concerned.
