 Submissions for HW1 closed before the specified late submission deadline that is listed on canvas and CMS.  I know I should have submitted it already I just got behind during online classes.

  Yes, there was a mistake. The late deadline should have been 11:59PM but was 11:59AM. I am giving you an extension on the assignment.
