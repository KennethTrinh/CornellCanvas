 When doing our testing cases, do we have to test cases separately, or can we do it in one list. For example, my tests for append and tostringrev are just 5 cases of strings being appended. Some are empty, some are all white space. Is this okay?

  Please don't put ALL test cases in one testing procedure.
 </p>

  If you read the handout carefully, it says to test append and toStringRev together. You can't do them separately because you have to build lists to test toStringRev. So, these two are tested together.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each other method should be tested in its own testing procedure.

   I am testing methods in separate procedures. Iâ€™m just wondering if we can test different conditions or cases in one procedure like in the examples I provided.
