 It seems that the import commands is not working for my A2Test.java. The file seems to be in the default package. What should I do?

  You didn't add the file to your project correctly. I suggest deleting that file and then creating a new A2 and new A2Test file and copying and pasting the code from the A2Skeleton into those new files
