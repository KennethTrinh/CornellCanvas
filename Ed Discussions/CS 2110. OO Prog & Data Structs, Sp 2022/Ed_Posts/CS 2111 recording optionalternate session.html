 I really want to sign up for CS2111 but unfortunately my two other classes' lectures collide with both CS2111 sessions. I did not have the easiest time in CS1110 so I think CS2111 is a great option.
</p>
<p>
 I cannot drop any of those two classes (OR3310 and OR 3510) because they are required by OR major. Will the staff be willing to record the CS2111 session? Will there be another 2111 session if the demand is high? Thank you.
</p>

  I'm sorry, there will not be another section of CS2111.
 </p>
 <p>
  Further, while we may record the first two sessions of CS2111, all the rest will be in-person and not recorded.

   Hi Professor Gries,
  </p>
  <p>
   If the first two sessions are recorded, will they be posted in the zoom section of the canvas page? Also, when should we expect them to be posted?
  </p>
  <p>
   Thank you for your help!
