  i just had a question about a1 because my partner couldn't explain it to me well when we worked on it:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  if the precondition for addAdvisor1 is the first advisor is unknown, how can i test this assert statement with assert throws if you can't access advisor1 in the testing class since it's private and there's no setter for it?
 </paragraph>

  The way that we test assert statements is to pass some argument or use some value that violates the precondition. In this case it is a PhD with a known first advisor, so you need to create a PhD and give it a known first advisor and then try to call the method with that PhD object.
