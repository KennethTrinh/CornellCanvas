 Good evening!
</p>
<p>
 The room for the CS2110 Final tomorrow at 9AM is Barton Hall!
</p>
<p>
 Be there at least ten minutes early, and bring your Cornell ID card. Lay it on the table in front of you. We will scan it in as the Final progresses, so we have a record in case your Final doesn't get properly scanned and uploaded to Gradescope.
</p>
<p>
 Those of you with SDS authorization for a reduced distraction room, go to Gates 114.
</p>
<p>
 Those of you with SDS authorization for extended time but not a reduced distraction room, report to Phillips 219.
</p>
<p>
 We have already found a typo on the Final! It says that "You have 90 minutes" (or only 1.5 hours). That is wrong! The Final is 2.5 hours, or 150 minutes. Of course, many of you will finish it early and leave early.
</p>
<p>
 We wish you good fortune on taking the final tomorrow!

     The email I got says 219 Phillips (SDS authorization for extended time); was this correct or a typo?
