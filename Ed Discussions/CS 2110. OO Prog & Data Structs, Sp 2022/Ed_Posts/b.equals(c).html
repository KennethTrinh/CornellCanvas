<p>
 Why is it that
</p>
<p>
 (new Double(2.0 * 3.0)).equals(new Double(1.0 * 6.0))  returns true
</p>
<p>
 but
</p>
<p>
 new Double(2.0 * 3.0)) == new Double(1.0 * 6.0) returns false?
</p>

  Top one is a method from the Double class that checks if a Double has an equivalent value with another object. In this case the object is a Double with the same values so it returns true. In fact, you can read exactly what .equals does for the Double class:

  Bottom one is an operator that checks the location in memory of two objects. The two Doubles in your example are not the same object. They have two distinct locations in memory. So == is false.
