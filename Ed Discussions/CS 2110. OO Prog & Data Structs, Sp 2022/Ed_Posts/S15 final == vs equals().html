 In the Spring 2015 finals, the T/F question, can you explain why this is the case?
</p>
<p>
 I understand that for non-primitive types, why False would be the correct answer, and a String is a non-primitive type.  However, when I run this in Jshell, it tells me b == c is true.

<p>
 Similarly, say b and c were Integers, would the answer be T or F on the exam?  Because Jshell would automatically unwrap them when comparing b and c, giving me true.

 Thanks!!

  It depends on how you declare the variables. If you're not using the
  <b>
   new
  </b>
  keyword and if the Strings or Integers are "equal" then I think Java will make both variables point to the same place in memory for optimization purposes. Look at how the output is different when I use the
  <b>
   new
  </b>
  keyword.

  Also, don't mind me using the deprecated constructor of Integer and the syntactical mistake.  Hope this helped.
