  Supposed there is a tombstone at index i, if a new element is added to the HashSet with Hashcode i, will the new element replace the tombstone, or will it need to be moved forward via linear probing?

  You said "Hashcode i", I think you mean more generally just being mapped to bucket i (hashcode mod number of buckets)?

  With linear probing and tombstones, we will need to treat that space as occupied and keep looking for an open bucket.
