 The expression 'a' == (int) 'a' evaluates to true. But 'a' evaluates to 'a', and (int) 'a' evaluates 97. Why is 'a' == 97 ?
</p>
<p>
 Is Java automatically widening the cast of 'a'?
</p>
<p>
 For example, why then wouldn't (int) 3.2 == 3.2 be true?
</p>

  Yes Java automatically widens 'a' to 97, doing (int) 'a' is just saying 'a' == 97 and then the LHS 'a' is widened to '97', this relates to what you had to do in A3.
 </p>
 <p>
  int(3.2) == 3.2 is false because 3 != 3.2 these are 2 different types and not 2 different representations of the same thing whereas another representation of 'a' in ASCII value is 97.
