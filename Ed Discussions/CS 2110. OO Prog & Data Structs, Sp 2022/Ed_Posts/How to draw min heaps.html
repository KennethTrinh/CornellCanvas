  I’m confused on how to draw min heaps, like this question. I think you using bubbling up? But I’m not sure how. How is drawing min heaps different from BSTs? How do you approach drawing min heaps?

  By now, you need to know how to add an element to a heap and how to poll (and delete) the min value.

  To add an element, add it at the next possible place in the heap and bubble up.
