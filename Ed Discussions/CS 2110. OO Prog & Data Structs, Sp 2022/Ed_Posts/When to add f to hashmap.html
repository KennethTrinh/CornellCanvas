  Before our main loop, are we supposed to add f to the hashmap or just the min-heap?

  What is the HashMap in our implementation? Answering that should tell you whether or not v should go into the HashMap.

  Did you put a comment on the HashMap saying what it contained? You MUST do that before doing anything else. Look at the section on the abstract algorithm in the handout. Do that right and you KNOW when to put something into the HahshMap.
