 How strict are caps on discussion section for this course? Is it possible to switch into a closed discussion by requesting it from a Professor?

  No, we have no control over those caps.

  The first two weeks are on zoom, and you can attend the zoom meeting you want.

  Hopefully, there will be enough de-enrolling that you can get into the discussion section you want at some point.
