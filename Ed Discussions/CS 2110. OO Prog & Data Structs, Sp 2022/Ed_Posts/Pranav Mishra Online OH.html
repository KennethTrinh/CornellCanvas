 I saw on Canvas that Pranav Mishra is supposed to have office hours on zoom right now (Tuesdays 1:45 pm - 3:45 pm). I don't see a post on Ed for us to access a zoom link.

<p>
 Also are Consulting Hours still running? I also saw that Grace Han should be on from 2-4 pm today, but the session doesn't seem to be active.

 Are the TAs mostly busy with regrade requests right now? I'm not sure who is available and who isn't during this time.
