 When recreating the calculatePropertyTax() method, why is this valid? Why wouldn't each building need to be cast down to their type of building? So, compile-time reference rule means that b.tax() is only valid if tax() is in the class and all the superclasses, does that still mean that bottom-up rule always applies?

  This is valid because Building has method tax. The implementation depends on the
  <b>
   dynamic type
  </b>
  of object b, which is not Building (since Building is an abstract class), but rather one of its subclasses.
