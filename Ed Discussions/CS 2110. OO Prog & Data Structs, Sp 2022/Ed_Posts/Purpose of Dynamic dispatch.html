  I know that dynamic dispatch is when the dynamic type of an object decides which method is executed at runtime. But, what is the purpose of dynamic dispatch? When is it used? I donâ€™t understand when/why it would be used.

  During runtime, whenever a method call m(...) is executed, the bottom-up/overriding rule is used to determine which method m(...) to call and calls it. That is "dynamic dispatch".

  The dynamic type is being used, since that is the name of the partition at the bottom of the object.
