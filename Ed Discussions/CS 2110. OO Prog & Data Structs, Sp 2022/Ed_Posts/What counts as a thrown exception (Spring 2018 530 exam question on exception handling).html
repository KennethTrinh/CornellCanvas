  For the last question could a solution be if s was an empty string instead of null because then you would divide by zero which would throw an exception?

  Actually that would not work.

  1/0 would be caught by the runtimeexception which would then enter another try block with no Exceptions thrown.

  Would p(5,"hi") be a possible answer? Because there would be nothing to catch 5/0?
