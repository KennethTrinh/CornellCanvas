  Why does (Integer) ob get accepted by the compiler? I understand that it doesn't have the partiiton of integer so it fails at runtime, but why wouldn't it fail at compile time? If this doesn't fail at compile time, would every object cast succeed at compile time either for an Object class object.

  For example would
  <bold>
   (Animal) ob
  </bold>
  also get accepted by the compiler? But then get rejected at runtime because there's no Animal partition?

  Yes, because all classes are subclasses of Object. So at compile-time the compiler will allow downcasting of any parent class to a child class.

  if down cast would fail at runtime, how is this working?

  It fails if Animal is not a subclass of Object. In this case Animal IS a subclass of Object, so it will not fail at runtime. However, if you have two classes that have a parent-child relationship with each other, but one of them has compile-type that is not compatible with the type we're casting to, then you will fail at runtime, for example:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  class A {
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  }
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  class B {
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  }
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Object o = new B();
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  A a = (A) o;
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Compiles because Object and A, and Object and B have a parent-child relationship. However, B and A do not, and this will fail at runtime with a ClassCastException.
