  Why is the answer to 3(b) i=k?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Shouldn't it be i=k+1 so that there is no element in the sorted section?

  It is correct. Think of these facts.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1. The precondition says that h &lt;= k. Therefore the segment b[h..k] has at least one element.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. Making i = k initially means that the segment b[h..k] has ONE element, and a one-element segment is sorted, so the invariant is true.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Now, one CAN start with i = k+1. That just means the invariant is true with segment b[i..k] empty.
