  Will we only need to test linked lists whose Nodes' values are String? Or will we need to test DLList&lt;Integer&gt; or DLList&lt;Boolean&gt; as well?

  Something in programming that we do to shorten test cases is if it worked for 2/3 objects you can be sure it works for all objects since there’s nothing ‘special’ when assigning a field to an object, so if it works for let’s say String and Integer you can almost be sure it works for booleans and other objects (I say objects in reference to the primitive type’s wrapper classes)

  Are you not curious to see whether it works properly on classes other than String?

  Why ask whether you HAVE to?  Play around, enjoy it. Try things out.
