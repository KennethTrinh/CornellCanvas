 Hello!
</p>
<p>
 We were wondering if it is possible for a Ph.D. object to only have one advisor? (Context- We are trying to make test cases for IsSiblingOf and wanted to know if we should be testing null cases)

  Yes a PhD can have only one advisor as long as it’s the advisor1 field.

   but we don't have a constructor which only takes one advisor and the second constructor has its precondition set such that advisors can never be null
