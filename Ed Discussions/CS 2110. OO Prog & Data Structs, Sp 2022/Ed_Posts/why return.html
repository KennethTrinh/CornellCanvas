  Why if u is visited then return? I don't understand how removing the precondition changes things. (also since the first step of the algorithm with precondition is mark u visited.

  If u is visited that means we can't go along the path it was about to go on since the specifications say "visit every node reachable ALONG A PATH OF UNVISITED NOTES from node u", after that if u was not visited, we mark it visited.
