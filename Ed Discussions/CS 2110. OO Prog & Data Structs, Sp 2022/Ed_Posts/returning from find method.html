 I wrote the method for find(), but unsure how to successfully return from that method. I know that once im at the orb, i have to stop seraching, and I have that placed before the recursive call but not sure what im returning, as I keep getting an error that once I reach the orb saying "Code errored during the hunt phase".
</p>
<p>
 Any hints or tips?

  Show us the method in a private thread.

  We need to see your method specification, not just the code. I hope you followed the guidelines given for find in the pinned A8 note.
