  Hello, in both A2 and A1 assignments I had troubles uploading  code (files of .java) into Eclipse.   For A1 it was when I would save the code in progress to later re upload into java and for A2 it was the assignment itself. To prevent this in the future I would like to know how or where I can find a method/way to import .java files  that are saved on my computer.( I have a mac if that makes a difference)

  They should be saved if you are creating your project inside your workspace correctly. One of the easiest ways to do this is to create your project and classes inside Eclipse and then open the files you downloaded and copy and paste that code into those files.
