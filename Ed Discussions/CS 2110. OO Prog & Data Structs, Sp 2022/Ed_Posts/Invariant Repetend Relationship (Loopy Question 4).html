  I have a question on loopy question 4. It says the repetend maintains the invariant. So does that mean that if the repetend is true the invariant must be true, or that if the repetend is true the invariant can be true?

  The repetend isnâ€™t something that can be true.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The repetend is the body of statements that is executed at each iteration.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The invariant and loop condition are true when the repetend is executed, and its execution should terminate with the invariant true.
