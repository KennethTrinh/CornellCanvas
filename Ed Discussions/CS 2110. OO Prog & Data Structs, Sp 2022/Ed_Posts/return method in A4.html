 are we supposed to return just the node or the value inside of it for the 4th method (returning @ node n)?

  Adding on, for A4, you can assume preconditions will never be violated.

   One of the beauties of Java is that the method header explicitly says the type that the method will return. Since the header is public
   <b>
    Node
   </b>
   node(int k), we know that the method node will return a node object. In short: return the node

     The precondition states 0 &lt;= k &lt; size of the list. k being anything violates the precondition when the list is empty. Because even if k is 0, it won't be less than the size(also 0). Thus, you assume that you will never run into the case where the method is run and the list is empty.
