  One of the beauties of Java is that the method header explicitly says the type that the method will return. Since the header is public

   Node

  node(int k), we know that the method node will return a node object. In short: return the node

  The precondition states 0 &lt;= k &lt; size of the list. k being anything violates the precondition when the list is empty. Because even if k is 0, it won't be less than the size(also 0). Thus, you assume that you will never run into the case where the method is run and the list is empty.

  Adding on, for A4, you can assume preconditions will never be violated.
