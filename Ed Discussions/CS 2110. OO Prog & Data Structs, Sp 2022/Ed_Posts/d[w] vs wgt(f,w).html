  d[w] is the shortest known distance from the start node to node w.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If w is in the settled set, it is the shortest known distance over all paths.
  <break>
  </break>
  If w is in the frontier set, it is over paths all of whose nodes are in the settled set except w.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  wgt(f, w) is the length on edge (f, w).

  for the return list i have :
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  List&lt;Node&gt; Spath= new LinkedList&lt;&gt;(SandF.keySet());
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  // return Spath;
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  But  then the instructions say this ( put below) i am unsure what I should do. because i get an error saying that the second return statement will never be reach  which is true I understand .   but how am i supposed to return the shortest path then .
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  alternatively can i just input SandF.keySet() into the code below?

 <pre>Put all your code before this comment. Do not change this comment or return statement
        // no path from v to end.
        return new LinkedList&lt;&gt;();
        </pre>
