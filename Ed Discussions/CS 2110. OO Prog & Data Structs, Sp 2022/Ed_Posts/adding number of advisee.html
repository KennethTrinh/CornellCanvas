 The instructions say that three methods must update the number of advisees when an advisor is added. But, for the second constructor, could we just call the addadvisor1 and addadvisor2 method which add one to the advisor's number of advisees? That way, we don't have to add to the number of advisees in the second constructor?

  You may have trouble writing assert statements for Preconditions.

  Take a look at the pinned Ed Discussion note on A1 for info about this.
