  The constructor method for the PhD class says that it is supposed to instantiate a PhD object with all 6 fields. I realize that with the first PhD it has no advisors however what do you assign as a placeholder then?

  Read the class invariant (i.e. the javadoc comments that should be on each field)

  I tried using null however when I run the test it keeps getting stuck on the first test for method advisor1 saying "java.lang.Error: Unresolved compilation problems: The field PhD.advisor1 is not visible" and then "The field PhD.advisor2 is not visible". Should I not put null as the expected out put in the advisor test?

  You're trying to access private fields in your test class. Since the fields are private, you cannot access them outside the PhD class
