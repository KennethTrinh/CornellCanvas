 Should we be adding nodes to F at some point?

  Looking at the abstract algorithm should answer that question. Maybe the confusion is with the uses of SandF and F. F is a heap. What do we use a heap for?

   I think I'm confused because the loop should run while F is not empty, but when would F ever have more than one thing in it considering that it is initialized with just v in it and at no time do you add anything to that minheap? and then you remove that thing right away
