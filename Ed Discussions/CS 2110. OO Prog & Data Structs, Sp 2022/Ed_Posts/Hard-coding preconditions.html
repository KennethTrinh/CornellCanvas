  When initializing the method so that S = {}; F = {v}; d[v] = 0, is it okay to directly put in the 0 and null values (i.e. insert(v,0))? Does this count as using magical numbers, or is this okay?

  That's fine. It does not count as using magical numbers. You need to give the map and heap initial values to work with, and the distance from v to itself would be 0.
