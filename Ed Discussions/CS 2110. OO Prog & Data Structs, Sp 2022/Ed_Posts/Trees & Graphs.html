 <paragraph>
  my reasoning to this being false is that we can have a directed graph such that it's two ways, what does it mean that "Trees must be connected" Does that mean we have a node in the graph that has no edges in or out?

  Below is a graph with 4 nodes ---A, B, C, D-- and two edges: (A,B) and (C,D).
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  It consists of two connected components, but the graph itself is not connected. e.g. there is no way to get from node A to node C.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The graph is not a tree. It consists of TWO trees. We could call it a forest.
