  I think as long as it's a class in the submit package it should be fine.

  The assignment instructions say:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  "In the end, make sure that if we replace our package submit in our solution by your
  <break>
  </break>
  package submit , your solution will still work as intended."

  This also means you shouldn't modify anything outside the submit package.
