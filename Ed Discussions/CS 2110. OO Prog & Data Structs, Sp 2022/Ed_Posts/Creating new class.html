 Am I allowed to create a new class for a8? I'm trying to do the best optimization I can, and I think changes I want would require a new class.

   I think as long as it's a class in the submit package it should be fine.
  </p>
  <p>
   The assignment instructions say:
  </p>
  <p>
   "In the end, make sure that if we replace our package submit in our solution by your
   <break>
   </break>
   package submit , your solution will still work as intended."
  </p>
  <p>
   This also means you shouldn't modify anything outside the submit package.
