  Is i=0; acceptable? Or no, since h could be a value that's not 0?

  i = 0 doesn’t truthify the invariant, that would actually make one element part of the product of these segment if you did i =0 for the precondition since i is to the left of the line so you’d basically make b[h..i] = product of these and b[0…0] has one element (which we don’t want)
