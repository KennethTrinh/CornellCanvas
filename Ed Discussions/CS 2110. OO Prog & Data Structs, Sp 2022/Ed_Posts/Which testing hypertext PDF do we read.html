  "Determining what test cases to use: Read the pdf file in the JavaHyperText entry “testing”, especially the last part of that pdf file. It is important. Also, refer to the notes on the recitation on testing."

  I think from the post #698 with the Professor's comment it refers to whitebox and blackbox testing so I think this pdf will be handy https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/JavaAndDS/files/testing.pdf
