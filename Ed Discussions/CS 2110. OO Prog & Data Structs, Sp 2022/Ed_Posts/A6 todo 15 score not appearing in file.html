  Inside the try statement, I have used out.println() to print the score on the file. And I have used print statements to make sure that the out.println() statement is getting executed.

  I thought using out.println() would be enough to print the score on the file, but would there by any other reasons for why the score would not be appearing on the file?

  Are you sure it's not?  Maybe you need to closer your editor and reopen it.  Not all editors will update the file contents in real time.

  I have realized that a file of the same name has been created in my a6 folder in the eclipse workspace folder, and all of the values were being added there, but not in the original folder. Is this supposed to happen?

  Is it possible you accidentally changed which file you were saving to in the file chooser interface?

  It sounds like your code is changing the path of the file that is being saved.  That or there is some confusion about which file you are selecting.  We can't discern which based on the provided information.  Suggest you see a consultant who can watch the process and provided more specific guidance.
