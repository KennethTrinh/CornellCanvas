 This is stated in the specification of toStringRev():
</p>
<p>
 "Extreme case to watch out for: E is string and values are the empty string"
</p>
<p>
 What does this mean? What does "E is string and values are the empty string" mean?
</p>

  Try to make the Linked List allow Strings by doing DLList&lt;String&gt; (making the generic a string) and try appending the empty string "" and see what happens is the edge case they're talking about.
