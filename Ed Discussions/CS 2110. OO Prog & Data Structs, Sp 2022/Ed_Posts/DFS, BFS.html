 Given this is false, is the converse true? Is DFS faster for sparse graphs and BFS faster for dense graphs? Or is the density of graphs not a factor that determines whether DFS or BFS is faster?

  Density is not a factor for whether it's faster, but it depends on what you're searching for,
 </p>
 <p>
  let's say the size of your graph is 10000000000000000000,
 </p>
 <p>
  and you are searching for an element in the very beginning, BFS is better
 </p>
 <p>
  if you are searching an element near the end DFS is better (usually)
