  Think about the case when k == m. At that point, s = product of these for b[m..n] according to the loop invariant. If that is the case, we are done because that is precisely the post condition. So the condition should be k &gt; m or k != m, because at the iteration where k == m, we meet the post condition and should terminate, not execute the loop body.

  Could you explain how when k == m meets the post condition? I don't see how s could equal the product for b[m..n] if it still hasn't multipled s by b[k] when k == m. Wouldn't that leave out the last value, b[m] in the product s?

  With the way k is indexed, it is already included in the product from the last iteration. Take a look at the repetend solutions and it will make more sense.
