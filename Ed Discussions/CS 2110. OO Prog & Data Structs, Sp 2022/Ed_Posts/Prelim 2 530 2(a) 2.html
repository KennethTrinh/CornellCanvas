 Hi!
</p>
<p>
 I think the solution to this question is wrong. The tightest complexity should be $O(n)$ in my opinion. Please let me know if I miss anything.
</p>
<p>
 The main issue of the current solution is that the complexity bound(O(n)) of inner loop is loose. So for any $n$, let's suppose $ 2^{k} \le n &lt; 2^{k+1}$. Then, we have $k+1$ outer loops. For $i$-th outer loop(i starting from $0$), the complexity of corresponding inner loop is $2^{i}$.
</p>
<p>
 So the total complexity is $\sum_{i=0}^{k}2^{i} = O(2^k) = O(n)$. This is the tighter bound I found.
</p>
<p>
 Thanks!

  I had the same thought. In the last iteration of the outer loop, sum++ runs at most n times. In each iteration of the outer loop, sum++ runs twice as many times as the previous iteration, totaling at most n+(n/2)+(n/4)+(n/8)+...+1, which is never more than 2n.

   I'm taking the Prelim 2 7:30 and I think it's the same 2(a) 2.
  </p>
  <p>
   I always write O(n) and I believe his argument is correct

  The question on the prelim has been regraded.
