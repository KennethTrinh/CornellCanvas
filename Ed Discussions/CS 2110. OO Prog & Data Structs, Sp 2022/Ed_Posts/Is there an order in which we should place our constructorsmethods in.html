 I just followed the order from the document, but if I do that then the second constructor comes after multiple methods. Is there a set organization that we should adhere to?

  Someone asked this in a private post, so I’ll quote Tomer’s answer: “The order won't make a difference to the grader, but by convention, fields are at the top and then constructors under that and then the rest of the methods are below that.”
