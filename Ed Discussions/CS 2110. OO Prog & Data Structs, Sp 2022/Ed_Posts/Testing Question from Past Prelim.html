<p>
 When foo(-1, -1) runs through this it reaches the line "if (b==0 || b== -1) throw new IllegalArgumentException()". I thought that once it reached this exception it would stop, and simply output Illegal ArgumentException.
</p>
<p>
 But according to the answer, it doesn't stop, but rather goes to catch(Exception e) and then runs through those lines. Why is this?

 <p>
  Because IllegalArgumentException is a subclass of Exception (but not of ArithmeticException).
