 I know that the algorithm must stop as soon as the shortest path from node v to node end has been determined. However, I am confused as to what am I supposed to return. How can I get a list of all the nodes from v to end?

  The class has a method that, when called properly, returns the list.

  Read the specifications of the methods in the class.
