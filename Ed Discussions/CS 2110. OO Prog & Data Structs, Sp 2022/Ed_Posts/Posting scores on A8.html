 Our A8 Ed Discussion thread now has a link to a googledoc spread sheet where you can post your scores on A8. Here's the link:

 At the moment, there is
</p>
<p>
 1. One place for showing your score on one run starting with a particular seed.
</p>
<p>
 2. One place for showing your score in headless mode starting with a particular seed and running on 30 caverns.
</p>
<p>
 Gries has two in each of those, running with different strategies.
</p>
<p>
 Feel free to put your score there! Let's see how well people are doing.
</p>
<p>
 Please keep the spread sheet neat.
