  I am confused on how to test isSiblings(). I understand the different test cases but I am having trouble setting it up. I create new PhD() objects; some with the same first/second advisors and some not. To specify the advisors I need to create PhD() objects for them too? Then I can test if they are siblings? I want to call the first PhD constructor to initialize the possible advisors and the second constructor to actually test if two PhDs have the same advisors or not.

  To test whether two PhDs are siblings because their first advisors are the same,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1. Create a PhD named AD that will be the advisor.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. Create a PHD p1 and make AD its first advisor.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  3. Create a PHD p2 and make AD its first advisor.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Now do an assertEquals with first argument true and second argument p1.isSiblings(p2).
