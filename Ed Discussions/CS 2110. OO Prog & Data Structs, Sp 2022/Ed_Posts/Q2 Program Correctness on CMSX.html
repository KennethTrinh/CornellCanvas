 I got a notification that Q2 Program Correctness was just released on CMSX. Is this quiz different than the canvas quiz we are supposed to complete by tomorrow? Are we supposed to do both quizzes? The questions on the CMSX quiz appear to be on content we haven't learned yet and I am confused how we are supposed to complete it before lecture if we don't know it.

  Yes, it's another quiz that should also be finished by Monday night. It's meant to be taken after completing the corresponding

  . Be sure to track the "Work Available" column in the 3-week schedule, as that's where the tutorial was made available last Friday.
