  I don't know what is wrong with this, and why I am getting this error. I have tried for a very long time to fix it, but don't know what to do.

  I think you have to put both .java files under a package. You can name the package anything if one isn't already named/provided. I think the JUnit path is confused because there is no source folder

  Take a look at all your other projects. Each has a directory src, which contains all the .java classes, either directly under src or in a package.
