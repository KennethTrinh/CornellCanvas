 (l) when can you make sure our code doesn't have a race condition then, I said false because to prove a for all statement you can't prove it for 1000 numbers,
</p>
<p>
 (m) I know this is true, but on the hw when we put synchronized on one of the methods but not the other we still had a race condition, can someone explain why?
</p>
<p>
 Process 1: the y=y+2 Process 2: synchronized(lock) y=y+3
</p>

  Because an unsynchronized use is like going in the back door of the outhouse.

  Look at the second half of this JavaHyperText page for an explanation:
