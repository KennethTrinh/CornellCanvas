  For dfs, isn't it supposed to be as follows: for each neighbor w of node u, add w to the front of the list/stack?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  In prelim 2 sp 2019 7:30pm for question 6d, the solutions say to add to the end of the list (addLast). I am confused as to why this is the case.

  When done recursively, I don't think it matters if you add w to the front or back of a list. You just need a set to distinguish which nodes have already been visited.

  But it's iterative DFS. Is the solution wrong? I think we should use stack.addFirst(root); and stack.removeFirst(); here.

  I see. So can I use stack.addFirst(root); and stack.removeFirst(); here? They seems to have the same behavior as using stack.addLast(root); and stack.removeLast();
