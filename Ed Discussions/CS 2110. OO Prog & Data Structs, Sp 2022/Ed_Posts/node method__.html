<p>
 for the method node, it says that we have to implement so it takes linear time and not constant time
</p>
<p>
 for when the inputs for k are 0 (first node) or 1 less than the size of the doubly linked list (last node), will we be punished grading wise if we just add an if statement that returns the first node if k is 0 and the last node if k is 1 less than the size of the doubly linked list? (since that would take constant time)

  Why make those tests for first and last node when one can't test all of the nodes in the list? There might be 10000 elements on the list.
 </p>
 <p>
  Don't do it.

   I would still be writing linear time code for the ones in between the first and last nodes
  </p>
  <p>
   The implication here is that I should write linear time code that covers all the nodes, not just those in between?
