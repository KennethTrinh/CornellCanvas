  Say class B is a subclass of class A, and we create an object of class A. In the object diagram, does the partition for class B exist when we first create the object of class A? Or does the lower partition for class B only appear if we do a downcast to class B?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  A a = new A();
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  a = (B) a;

  If B is a subclass of A, creating an object of class A will not create a B partition since B extends A. Creating an object of class B will create an A partition.

  Ok, that makes sense. Thanks! I was also reading the Java HyperText entry for object casts and got a bit confused by the following:

  In this case, isn't C a subclass of ob? So how does instanceof work if ob doesn't have a C partition? (I know it doesn't work in this case, but just in general when you're trying to test whether a downward cast will work using instanceof)

  Yes, but the difference is that variable ob was assigned the value returned by calling the C constructor rather than the Object constructor and the variable itself just has type Object
