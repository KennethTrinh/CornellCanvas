 Hello,
</p>
<p>
 The assignment 8 handout says that we may get points deducted if we have any println statements?
</p>
<p>
 Does this mean that we shouldn't have any println statements at all (like the ones that are displayed on the console when we run a particular map) or should we not have any println statements in the Pollack.java file?
</p>
<p>
 Thank you!
</p>

  Your class Pollack,java should not contain println statements.
 </p>
 <p>
  Comment them out.
