  Hello,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The assignment 8 handout says that we may get points deducted if we have any println statements?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Does this mean that we shouldn't have any println statements at all (like the ones that are displayed on the console when we run a particular map) or should we not have any println statements in the Pollack.java file?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thank you!

  Your class Pollack,java should not contain println statements.
