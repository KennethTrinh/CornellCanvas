 What is a "reasonably high score"? Is that based on what others do?

  We do not release information on exactly how it’s scored beyond what’s already listed on the handout. Your grade on A8 will NOT be affected by how your scores on the seeds compare to those of other students. But looking at their scores will tell you how much it can be optimized.
