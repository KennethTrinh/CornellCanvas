 I just finished filling in the required code for A2.java and tried to test A2Test.java. When I did, it appears as though testLoop1() is preventing the rest of the test cases from being completed. Any ideas as to why this might be occurring?

  You probably have an infinite loop in loop 1

   Didd you write ALL the methods before testing? That is not good.
  </p>
  <p>
   Writing everything and then testing is a terrible way to proceed.
  </p>
  <p>
   PLEASE, intersperse coding and testing as much as possible.

    Apologies for my unclear wording-- I completed tests after writing every method, but this problem only arose once all methods had been completed in their entirety. In other words, testLoop1() was working up until this final test run.

    Not sure entirely what changed, but I restarted Eclipse and the testing ran properly.
