 In the function loop5 it says:
</p>
<pre>/** Any positive integer n can be written in this form: c*2^y, where &lt;br&gt;
     * both c and y are positive and c is odd. &lt;br&gt;
     * Return the value c. &lt;br&gt;
     * Precondition: n &gt; 0 */</pre>
<pre>public static int loop5(int n) {
        /* TODO 13: Write a while-loop that continually divides n by 2
         * until n is odd (it may be odd initially). Then return n.</pre>
<p>
 Particularly "Then return n."
</p>
<p>
 It has to be a typo, as we are meant to return the value c, am I right?

  After dividing n by 2 until it can't be anymore, n will be equal to c. The Todo comment is just giving you an explanation on how to solve the problem so that the method does what the specification says it should do.

   No. Return n after dividing it by 2 and it can no longer be divided by 2.
