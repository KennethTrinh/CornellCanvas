  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I am a bit confused on how the formatting of the testing the assert statements work. In the handout, this example is shown: assertThrows(AssertionError.class,
  <bold>
   ()
  </bold>
  -&gt; {new P(null);});
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The
  <bold>
   ()
  </bold>
  is considered empty as there are no parameters for this example. However, when I was trying to write the assert statement test, I had filled those parentheses with parameters of the method in question and reached an error. When I erased the parameters and made it empty '()', the assert statement worked. Should I keep the paratheses empty then?

  There should be no parameters!
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  This call on assertThrows has as its second argument the anonymous function
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <bold>
   ()
  </bold>
  -&gt; {new P(null);}
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  When the body of assertThrows is being executed, it executes a call on this function. That call causes the method body   new P(null). to be executed, which should throw the AssertionError.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  In your case you should replace the call new P(null) but, for example,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  new PhD(...)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  giving the constructor call PhD(...) suitable arguments that cause the assert statement to fail.
