  so in Jshell i created a classe and sublcass with the same field and method.
 </paragraph>
 <pre>jshell&gt; public class First{
   ...&gt; int x = 0;
   ...&gt; public int num(){
   ...&gt; return 0;}
   ...&gt; }

jshell&gt; public class Second extends First{
   ...&gt; int x = 1;
   ...&gt; public int num(){
   ...&gt; return 1;}
   ...&gt; }
   
   jshell&gt; First a = new Second();
a ==&gt; Second@2beabd31
   
   jshell&gt; a.x;
$4 ==&gt; 0

jshell&gt; ((Second)a).x;
$5 ==&gt; 1

jshell&gt; a.num();
$6 ==&gt; 1

jshell&gt; ((First)a).num();
$7 ==&gt; 1
</pre>

  I have 2 questions.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1) Why is it that when I access the field x for object a the default is from the class First, and I need to cast to Second to access the Second class field x?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2) it appears as though the default method num() for object a is from Second class and that I cannot access First's num() by casting? Are fields and methods treated differently with casting?

  1. I think the answer is summed up in this JavaHyperText pdf regarding
  <link href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/JavaAndDS/files/fieldHiding.pdf"/>
  "Hiding a field". Basically, Java treats overridden fields and methods differently when you call them at runtime. Whereas methods work bottom-up based on the dynamic type of the object from which the method is called, fields are accessed bottom-up based on the
  <italic>
   compile-time
  </italic>
  type of the object. That's why
  <code>
   a.x == 0
  </code>
  ; because the static type of
  <code>
   a
  </code>
  is
  <code>
   First
  </code>
  ,  Java starts looking bottom-up from the from the
  <code>
   First
  </code>
  class. (Note that overriding fields is generally discouraged, so this shouldn't be a common occurrence you should be running into!)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. Remember that casting between classes does not change anything about the object itself at runtime; it merely provides a different perspective to the compiler. Casting
  <code>
   a
  </code>
  to
  <code>
   First
  </code>
  does not change the fact that
  <code>
   a
  </code>
  is still of type
  <code>
   Second
  </code>
  at runtime, and so the dynamic dispatch of the
  <code>
   num()
  </code>
  method call means that it will still call the
  <code>
   num()
  </code>
  in
  <code>
   Second
  </code>
  . But, because field accesses are dependent on the compile-time type, casting will indeed make a difference there.
