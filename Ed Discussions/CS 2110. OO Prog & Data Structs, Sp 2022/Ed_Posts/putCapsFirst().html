 Am I supposed to use the two StringBuilder objects to hold empty strings then append the capital or noncapital letters to the StringBuilders then smash them together in my return statement?

  The point of A3 is for you to figure out how to solve the problem given for each function. We can't tell you how to do it.

   I am just wondering why to use StringBuilder when you can use empty strings and concatenate the capital and noncapital letters.

    Search up “StringBuilder” in JHT to understand why one solution has better performance than the other, and why we use StringBuilder in the first place.

     Thank you, I see that adding characters to a dummy String is quite an expensive operation since a new String is created every time and that StringBuilder's append is better for performance especially when looping through another string.

      Perfect! And further discussion on efficiency will come up again in this course. Great that you are learning about it now.
