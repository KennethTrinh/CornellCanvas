 We were wondering if there is any way to test if the method returns an empty list when the path does not exist? I couldn't find it in the test cases.

  The very first test method tests this along with another path from one node to itself. Just read the spec of the first test method. Also, the test file tests all possible paths. If you dig through the test file, you will see a nested loop that does so.
