  For preconditions like "n has at least 2 chars", should we write an assertThrows test for when n is null too?

  n not being null is a precondition, so yes you need to test when n is null.

  Thank you! Does this mean that for other fields like year and month, we should have a precondition ensuring they are not null too?

  year and month are ints, there is no precondition they can't be null since these are primitive types meaning that you can't assign null as their values, just assert for the preconditions given to you by the javadoc.
