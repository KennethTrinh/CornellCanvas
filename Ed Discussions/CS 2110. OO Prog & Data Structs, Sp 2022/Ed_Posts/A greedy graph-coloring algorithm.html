  Yes.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Not the particular implementation but you should be able to execute it yourself:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1. Color the nodes in some order.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. When coloring a node, color it with the lowest color that is not the color of a neighbor.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  This makes it a greedy algorithm: Try to use as few colors as possible by always choosing the lowest possible color.
