 If you have nodes n1, n2, n3 in a DLList, does n2.next give you the "next" reference of n2 or the actual node n3?
</p>
<p>
 For example, if I executed the statement n2.next= null, would that make n3 null or just make the "next" reference of n2 null?

  n2.next would point to n3 (the actual node) in memory of you did n2.next but if you made the n2.next = null then that makes the field next in the n2 folder null but n3 still exists in memory as the exact same object as it was before you set n2.next to null
