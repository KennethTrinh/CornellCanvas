  When we have the time. We are still recovering from proctoring and grading the final, and there are other things ahead of it. We have to find them from a previous Canvas semester

  Links to the panopto lectures for Complexity and Sorting are now on the panopto page found in the bottom row of the first table on the Canvas home page.
