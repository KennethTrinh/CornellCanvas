  This course has reached in-depth cooperation with Google. If you need some basic info about java or eclipse, you can use Google freely. There is no need to wait until OH~

  For example, if you wonder why eclipse gives you a warning about "dead code", you can Google "java dead code." Then Google will let you know it means eclipse does not think you have the opportunity to run that code.

  All questions are welcomed in OH, but it would be better is we save time for more complicated problems.
