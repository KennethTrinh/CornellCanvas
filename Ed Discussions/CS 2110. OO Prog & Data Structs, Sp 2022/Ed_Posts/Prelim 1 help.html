  I didn't do good on prelim 1... is there anywhere I can do a full revision of my prelim with a tutor of some sorts to understand my mistakes.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2nd part of the question: is prelim 2 cumulative or will it only cover the new material.
 </paragraph>

  Thanks in advanced.

  Instructors and/or TAs are happy to meet with students, either by appointment (instructors only) or during their scheduled office hours (instructors and TAs). However, I suggest that prior to that meeting, you spend a good amount of time studying your exam first and looking up the corresponding concepts in JHT, and asking questions in EdStem if confused. That way we can focus the time on the most difficult concepts for you.

  Prelim 2 is not cumulative in the sense that we wonâ€™t explicitly ask questions on material covered on prelim 1. However, it is inevitable that prelim 1 material will come up again later in the course, as all the concepts build on each other. For example, we will use loop invariants to describe the partition algorithm for quicksort, which is covered on prelim 2.
