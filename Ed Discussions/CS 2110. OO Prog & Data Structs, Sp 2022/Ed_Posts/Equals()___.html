  Can someone please explain the last part of the method equals in different words? I have a series of if statements for the first few boolean qualifiers, but I'm confused on the last part about comparing the trees.

  I'm confused on comparing the sets. I tried do a for loop inside a for loop, but that will compare child 1A to child 2A, then child 1A to child 2B, then 1A: 2C, etc.
