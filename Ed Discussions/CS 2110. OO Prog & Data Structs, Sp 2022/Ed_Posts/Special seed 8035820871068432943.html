  Can you offer some insight into how this final "special seed" mentioned in the main A8 edstem post is different from other seeds? When my partner and I run this code the program displays a message that our solution to flee ran out of steps before returning, but we are lost as to how to change our code to prevent this error. Our code works with every other special seed. Thank you!
