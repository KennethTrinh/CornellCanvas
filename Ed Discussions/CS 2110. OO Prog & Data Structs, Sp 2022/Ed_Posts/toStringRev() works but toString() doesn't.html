  Honestly very ocnfused about this. toString() only returns the first value, im guessing i dont link the head node to the other nodes correct, but have no idea how toStringRev() would work then. Thoughts?

  revToString works if all of your .prev are assigned correctly. toString works correctly if all of your .next are correct

  toString is the method given to you, it should work? That means you’re linking the previous nodes correctly for the reverse to work but you’re not connecting the next node correctly which is why toString doesn't work the way you expect it to.
