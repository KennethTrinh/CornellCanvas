 There are some parts in my methods that when I save, (ie) this.attribute becomes attribute. i believe this has something to do with the eclipse preferences we set at the beginning of the semester, but i just wanted to make sure.
</p>
<p>
 tldr this.attribute vs attribute, latter being the correct format?

  Yep, it's part of the autoformatting preferences. It's deleted because it's deemed unnecessary in that specific case.

   I believe cathy answered it for me, but the question was about formatting preferences and grading in eclipse
  </p>
  <p>
   for example, say we have a method named example in a random class named ie, and we're comparing two attributes of two different instances of ie class.
  </p>
  <p>
   the fifth line has the line this.n == p.n. but when i save a file like this, the line becomes:
  </p>
  <p>
   n == p.n
  </p>
  <p>
   i just wanted to check if this was normal and there wouldn't be any grading penalties for this
  </p>
  <pre> public class ie {
    public ie(String n) 
        name = n
    public boolean example(ie p) {
        return this.n == p.n
        }
  }
</pre>

    Yes, our formatting preferences remove "this." where it is unnecessary.
   </p>
   <p>
    Leave it as.  n == p.n
   </p>
