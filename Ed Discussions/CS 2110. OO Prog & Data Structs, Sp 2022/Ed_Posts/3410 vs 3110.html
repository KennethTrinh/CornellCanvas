 Is there a disadvantage of choosing one over the other for next semester. How would each choice affect us in the future if it does? Thanks

  Personally I regret taking CS 3110 before CS 3410, because there are a lot of interesting classes which have 3410/4410 as a prereq,  like CS 4450, CS 5414, CS 5412. And 3410 is a prereq for 4410, so you need a full year to finish those classes. This of course depends on what upper level electives you are interested in!
 </p>

  I would try taking 3410 first because then you can take 3110 and 4410 concurrently and really open yourself up for any electives you want.

  An alternative to taking CS 3410 is taking ECE 2300 and CS 3420 (only offered in the spring). I recommend this track for any computer science  student who is interested in exploring computer engineering! I have taken this track and found it very rewarding because the material is covered more in depth and over two semester instead of one.

   I will answer this from my own perspective.  I invite others (TAs especially) to offer their own!

     For your CS major requirements, it doesn't matter too much.  The main thing is to look at what upper-level electives you think you might want to take.  Some have 3110 as a prereq, some have 3410, some have neither.

     For sake of slotting courses into your schedule in the next year, do bear in mind that (because of extraordinary staffing circumstances) 3410 is not being offered in Spring 2023.  That's especially relevant to any prereq chain involving 3410.

     If you care about such things, I'm teaching 3110 in the fall and (
     <i>

     ) Profs. Hsu and Kozen are teaching it in the spring.

     All else being equal, go with whichever looks more fun!  3110 is about the top of the software stack, the highest level of abstraction.  3410 is about the bottom, where software meets hardware.  Both are essential to being well-educated in the field!

    Thank you! Just to have an idea, if I wanted to specialize in one of cybersecurity, machine learning/AI, what would be the best option? Thank you for your response again!

     I can answer the cybersecurity one with some authority.  The main course is CS 5430, which I have taught several times.  That has a long prereq chain:  CS 3410 -&gt; CS 4410 -&gt; CS 5430.  So for that, take 3410 as early as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
     For machine learning, I'm not so much an expert.  The main course is CS 4780.  It has neither 3110 nor 3410 as a prereq.  Rather, it has a lot of math as its prereqs.
    </p>
    <p>
     For AI, the main course is CS 4700.  You're probably ready to take it now, assuming you've also taken CS 2800 this semester.
