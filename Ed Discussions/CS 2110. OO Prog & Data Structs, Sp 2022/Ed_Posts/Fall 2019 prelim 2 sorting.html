 What does h&gt;=k mean here? I was looking at lecture 12 and saw that for quicksort the following was used:
 <break>
 </break>
 If(b[h..k] has &lt;2 elements) return;
 <break>
 </break>
 Is it also acceptable to use this? Also, What happens when it returns?

  Just realized this part might be needed - do we need to look at the partition pre/post/invariant to answer (a)?
 </p>
 <p>
  Also, for (b4), what does it mean to “Write a statement that, given Post1 true, truthifies Post”? I don’t understand what the question is asking here. My guess is that it means to make Post look like Post1?…
