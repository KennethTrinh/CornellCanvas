 I am having trouble while testing TODO 7 and 8. Some clicks outside of the point's radius are being counted as hits. My math for checking whether a set of coordinates is in a circle seems right, so I'm not sure what the issue could be. I tried an alternate version of the math using java.lang.Math's sqrt(double a) function but for some reason its not giving me the correct value when I print test. Is this an issue with importing?

  In case anyone is stuck on the same problem that I was, keep in mind that "^" does not raise a value to its exponent in Java, you'd need to multiply it by itself however many times it's taken to the exponent or use Math.pow.

  Feeling really dumb right about now lol

  Also, you technically don't need to square root. You can just check the inequality before taking the square root.

    Thanks for the reply, I am currently doing this without the square root but am still running into the same issue.

     Then this might stem from an issue Akinfolami suggested, I had this issue too

   This might be a problem with how you are drawing the target. Check your paintDot method again. Make sure the coordinates for fillOval are accurate.

    Thanks for replying. I double checked my paintDot and am certain my call to fillOval follows the specifications, so I'm still confused as to where the problem could be.
