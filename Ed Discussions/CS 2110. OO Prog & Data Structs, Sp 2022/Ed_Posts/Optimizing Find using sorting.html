  I am trying to optimize my find by iterating through an array list of NodeStatus objects, but I want to sort them by their distance to the Orb. I'm not sure how to do this because I don't know how to sort a list of objects by a certain method. Let me know if I am missing something here!

  You can do it manually. Some people have put the nodes into a min-heap with priority being the distance to the Orb.

  But its easier to use some method that automatically uses some sort algorithm. Look at class NodeStatus. It implements comparable&lt;NodeStatus&gt;! And if you look at its method compareTo, you see that it compares two objects based on their distance to the orb.

  So you can make a collection of the neighbors and sort them using some Collections method.
