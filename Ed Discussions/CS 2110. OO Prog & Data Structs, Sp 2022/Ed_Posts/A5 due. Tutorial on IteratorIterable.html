  Good morning!

  1. A5 is due tonight. If you have a partner, please make sure you group on the CMS before submitting --remember one partner invites, the other accepts the invitation.

  2. You have to watch videos and study some material before next week's recitation. See the 3-week schedule on Canvas. In about 15 minutes of videos, you learn how to modify a collection --set, list, array, whatever-- so that a foreach loop can be used to enumerate its values. Then, in recitation, you will modify your A4 assignment so that you can use a foreach loop to enumerate the values of a doubly linked list! Neat!
