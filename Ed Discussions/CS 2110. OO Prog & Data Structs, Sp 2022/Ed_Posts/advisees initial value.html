 For advisor1 and advisor2 we set these to null if unknown or non existent. What should we initialize advisees to? Zero? Or null as well?

  I don't know in which method (including constructors) you are talking about.

  However, the class invariant says that field advisees contains the number of advisees of the PhD. Well, store a value in advisees to keep that defintion true.
