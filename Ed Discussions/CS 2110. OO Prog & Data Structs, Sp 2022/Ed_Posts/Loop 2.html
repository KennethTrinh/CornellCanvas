 For the method body of loop2, is the loop counter different than the sum? Should we declare both the sum and loop counter, and is it ok for us to directly modify n?

  Yes they are different. Since Loop2 is asking you to use a for-loop, we'd like you not to modify n in the loop, but instead use a loop counter.

   Thanks! In that case, would using the loop counter apply whenever we are dealing with a for-loop (i.e. loop1)?

    Yep, the general idea is that we use loop counters for for-loops, but for while loops, a loop counter isn't necessary, but can still be used.
