  The pdf says that there are 25 asserts statements needed. so for a line like;
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  assert a==b &amp;&amp; c==d;
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  does that count as one or two assert statements?

  Change the question to this: For a line like:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  assert a==b &amp;&amp; c==d;
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  how many assertThrows do you need to test each? What about this?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  assert 1 &lt;= m &amp;&amp;  m &lt;= 10?
 </paragraph>

  Don't worry about the exact number of tests.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Look at your assert statements and write tests for them
