 "Sorting a linked list allows us to use binary search instead of linear search on the list."
</p>
<p>
 Why is this statement wrong? I thought that linear search would use O(n) time, and when the list is sorted, by doing binary search it will only use O(log n) time.

  Yes, adding on: what you described with the time complexities only applies to arrays and ArrayLists, or anything in which querying the collection by index takes O(1) time. So in an array, we can simply write arr[i] for any i and we get the element at that index in O(1) time.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a LinkedList, as you saw in A4, you have to iterate (from the head or the tail) to get to that element at index i.

   Does int[]  or char[] count as an array, and thus getting an element at some index only take O(1) time?

    Yep! Those are int and char arrays. Querying by index would take O(1) time, yes, all correct.

   To get to node  I. in a linked list takes time O(i) -- takes time linear in i.
  </p>
  <p>
   Therefore, to find the middle element of a linked list with n elements takes n/2 tests --its O(n).
  </p>
  <p>
   Therefore, using binary search doesn't help.
