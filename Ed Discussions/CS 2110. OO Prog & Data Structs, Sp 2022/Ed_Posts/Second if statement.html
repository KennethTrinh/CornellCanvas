 Hello, I'm a bit confused about the meaning of the second if statement. Based on the algorithm, if the first if statement isn't true (w is not in S or F), doesn't that mean w has to be in F for the second if statement to be true (d[f] + wgt(f, w) &lt; d[w])? Would it be safe to assume that w is always in F when the code enters that the second if statement block?
</p>

  YES.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first if-condition is "w is not in S or F".
 </p>
 <p>
  If it is false, then "w IS in S or F". It could be in F, it could be in S.
 </p>
 <p>
  It doesn't matter which. But yes, if
 </p>
 <p>
  d[f] + wgt(f, w) &lt; d[w]
 </p>
 <p>
  that tells you a shorter path to w has been found.
  <break>
  </break>
  That cannot be if w is in S because the shortest path to w is already known.
  <break>
  </break>
 </p>
 <p>
  Therefore, if d[f] + wgt(f, w) &lt; d[w], you know that w is in F.
