 Is the purpose of Covid.java app/GUI just to visualize what is actually happening with our code, and nothing else?
</p>
<p>
 As for testing the functionality of our code, if I just check that our code passes all the test cases that we created in CovidTreeTest.java, things should be fine, right?

  Yes, and even though we're not grading testing this time, writing good test cases will help your score for correctness.

   For our purposes, yes Covid.java is just for visualization to see what the end product is.

   As for the functionality of your code. If you check that your code passes all the test cases that you created, thing should be fine as long as your test cases thoroughly tested the methods, you didn't defy spec by doing things such as unnecessary case-analysis or unnecessary tree traversal, you put your name/netid on the file, you put the time it took you to complete the assignment on the file, and you correctly identified the searching/counting methods.
