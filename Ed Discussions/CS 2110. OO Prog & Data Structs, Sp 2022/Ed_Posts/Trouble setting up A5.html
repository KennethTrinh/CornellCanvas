 I have set up the A5 build path as shown/instructed in the pdf.
</p>
<p>
 When I run Covid.java one of the following seems to happen every time, depending on the parameters I enter:
</p>
<p>
 1) I get a tree with a single node
</p>
<p>
 2) I get an error that looks like this (this is using the parameters we were told to enter if we only get single node trees):

 I have tried deleting the java project, restarting eclipse, etc. How can I fix this so I can get started on the assignment?

  That message is occurring because you have not implemented any methods yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  Take a look at line 150 in CovidTree.java. You have not yet learned how to read these statements.
 </p>
 <p>
  Don't look at the simulation at all until you have written and tested all the methods you are asked to write. Only then can the simulation run properly.
