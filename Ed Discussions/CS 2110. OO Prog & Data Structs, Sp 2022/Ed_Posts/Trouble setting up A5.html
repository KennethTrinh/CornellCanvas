  That message is occurring because you have not implemented any methods yet.
 </paragraph>

  Take a look at line 150 in CovidTree.java. You have not yet learned how to read these statements.

  Don't look at the simulation at all until you have written and tested all the methods you are asked to write. Only then can the simulation run properly.
