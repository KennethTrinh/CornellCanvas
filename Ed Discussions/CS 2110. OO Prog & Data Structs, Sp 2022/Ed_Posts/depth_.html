 This method is both a counting and a searching method ? (its a searching method because it is searching for the node that has the property human=p. But at the same time we have to accumulate the depth which is a form of "counting", right?

  The return type of the method, what value it is returning, has absolutely NOTHING to do with whether it is a searching or a counting method.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a searching method, one is looking for ONE node with a certain property. Thus, if it were counting, the "count" would always be 1.

   When we say searching or counting me look at how the method is written and whether it looks similar to a searching or counting method as shown in java hyper text (in this case it looks more like one than the other)
