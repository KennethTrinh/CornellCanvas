 For some reason, when we implement todo 14, our score at the top of the screen goes away (there is no space between the black screen and the file edge for the score). We are not really sure why this is happening. If we use NORTH for the BorderLayout, our Score appears but not our file bar, and if we use PAGE_START, our Score disappears but the file appears.
