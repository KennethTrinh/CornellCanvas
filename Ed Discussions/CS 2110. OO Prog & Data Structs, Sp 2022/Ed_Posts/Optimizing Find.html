  To optimize find, what we tried to do was to use a sorted ArrayList in the for loop of the dfs walk, sorted by the distance to the orb, but when we did this martha will not search correctly, specifically, she will sometimes return all the way back to the starting point, which then results in an error (also sometimes she will get to the orb in a way that seems like the way we would expect from the greedy algorithm).

  We cannot figure out why, logically, this would not be a correct implementation of a greedy algorithm based in the instructions.

  We can't say anything without seeing your code.
