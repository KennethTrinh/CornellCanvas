  I don’t even see why you’d need to remove stuff if you’re checking they’re equal

  The directions say to check that there are no duplicates so we were trying to use the remove() method to figure that out.

  why are you removing to check there are no duplicates?
  <break>
  </break>
  If they’re not equal return false, don’t try to make them equal

  Do not use remove.

  The instructions do NOT say to check whether are duplicates. Below is a quote from the comments in equals(). It says that there are no duplicates, not that you have to check that property.

  // Second, A child of one tree cannot equal more than one child of
  <break>
  </break>
  // tree because the names of Human's are all unique; there are no duplicates.
