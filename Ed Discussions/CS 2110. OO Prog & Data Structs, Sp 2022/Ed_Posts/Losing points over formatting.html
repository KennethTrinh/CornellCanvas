 I see you can lose points over "Eclipse formatting preferences" for the project. What exactly does that refer to and how can i make sure i don't lose stupid points?

  As long as you followed all the setup steps for the formatting preferences, then you shouldn't lose these points.

   You know what those formatting preferences are supposed to do --you could see that when you made changes are per instructions.
  </p>
  <p>
   For example, you know that unnecessary parentheses should be removed. Therefore, somewhere in some class, put something like
  </p>
  <p>
   int x= ((((4))));
  </p>
  <p>
   and see whether the parens are removed when you save the file in Eclipse.
