  If you are trying to test if the constructor throws an assertion error when null arguments are given as advisors then just put them in as null, you don't have to create a null object.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Example test:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <italic>
   assertThrows
  </italic>
  (AssertionError.class, () -&gt; new PhD("Null advisors", 2022, 2,
  <bold>
   null
  </bold>
  ,
  <bold>
   null
  </bold>
  ));

  It's important to note that null doesn't have a type. It is the lack of an object, so it can't have a type and you don't actually have to assign a variable equal to the value null. Instead you can just use the keyword null.
