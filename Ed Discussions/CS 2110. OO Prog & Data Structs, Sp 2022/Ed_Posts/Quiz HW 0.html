  I just wanted to confirm that the quiz HW0 mentioned in the lectures,  isn't available to us. I'm guessing that was a part of the class two years ago. Or was it available to us on CMS at some point?  (Mentioned in lec 1 part 4)

  HW0 was available on CMS after the first lecture and was due on January 25th.

  HW0 is worth nothing toward your final grade. It was optional.
