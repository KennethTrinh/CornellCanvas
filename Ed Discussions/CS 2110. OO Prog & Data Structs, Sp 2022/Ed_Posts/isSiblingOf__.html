  For isSiblingOf, if an object's first advisor is the same as another object's second advisor, does that also count as true?

  Yes, the spec says that two people are siblings if they have a non-null advisor in common. When you have an object's first advisor being the same as another object's second advisor, the object has a non-null advisor in common, which agrees with the spec.

  How many advisors back are we supposed to go? Indefinitely?

  For example, if two PhDs didn't have the same advisor, but their advisors were siblings, would these two latest PhDs counts as siblings or not?

  The only way you are an advisor is if your advisor 1 or 2 is the same as someone else's advisor 1 or 2.
