 If the backpointers are stored in Info objects, but the backpointer field of Info is private, how are we supposed to find the backpointer of a node?

  Try it! Item is an inner class! You had the same kind of thing in the linked list assignment.

   I don't know why, but for whatever reason I still can't access "dist" even though my partner can on their computer. I get the error "dist cannot be resolved or is not a field". Our folder hierarchies and everything else look the same though.

    We can't say without seeing it. It's best to talk to a staff person in person or zoom where you can show your screen
