  Why is dynamic dispatch better than downcasting? Could I get an example of dynamic dispatch vs. downcasting?

  Suppose we have classes Dog, Cat, Pig, etc. Each is a subclass of Animal. Suppose animal does not have method mm but all the others do. Then, for a variable
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Animal c;
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  to call a possible method mm in that object you have to write:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  if (c instanceof Dog)   { ((Dog)c).mm(); }
  <break>
  </break>
  else (c instanceof Cat)   { ((Cat)c).mm(); }
  <break>
  </break>
  else (c instanceof Pig)   { ((Pig)c).mm(); }
  <break>
  </break>
  ...
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  and whenever you add a new subclass (example Bat) you have to add another else-clause.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If you don't have OO in your language, then you are almost FORCED to write code similar to the above.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  However, add method mm to class Animal. Then, instead of that if-else sequence, write simply
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  c.mm();
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  and the Overriding/Bottom-up rule, which is dynamic dispatch takes over and works.

  To my understanding, when method mm is in class Animal then any of the subclasses can also use mm according to
  <italic>
   <bold>
    inheritance
   </bold>
  </italic>
  .
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  So, if method mm is in class Animal and c is of type Dog, when c.mm() is called, method mm in
  <bold>
   the Dog subclass is used
  </bold>
  by
  <italic>
   <bold>
    dynamic
   </bold>
   <bold>
    dispatch
   </bold>
  </italic>
  (AKA overriding/bottom-up rule). Is this correct?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Also, in this case, what is the static type of Dog and what is the dynamic type? Is the static type Animal, and the dynamic type is Dog?
