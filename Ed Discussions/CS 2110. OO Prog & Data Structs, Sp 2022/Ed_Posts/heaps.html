  Hello! I was going through the lecture slides and saw the poll method. I was wondering if the order of the statements in the orange box should be reversed? Because wouldn't n be the last element? Seems like the second statement might assign value of the second last element instead of the last?

  Thank you!

  It's correct, we want to replace the second last element, since we decrease the size of the heap by one, the size of the heap is n. So technically the last element now is what used to be the second last element.

  But the second last element becomes the last element after the assignment. If not, then at least in this example won't b[0] turn out to be 18 and not 19?

  it'll be 19 because the heap is b[0...n-1] because n is the size, just like an array

  let's say you had an array of size 20, the last element is b[19] not b[20]
