  In the lectures I could only find iterative BFS and DFS time/space efficiency for the optimized versions.  For the exam I am assuming we are just responsible for knowing the regular time/space because another ed discussion post said we weren't responsible for knowing how to develop the optimized versions.  Am I correct in that assumption? If so what would the time and space efficiency for the non-optimized versions of both BFS and DFS?

  Also, when is it better to use recursive DFS vs. iterative DFS?

  There is no ‘better’ it depends on what you want to do. I think you can derive the complexities from the code given on java hyper text

  What are the cases where one would be preferred over the others.  I also just want to make sure that what I derive is correct, is there anywhere I could check that?
