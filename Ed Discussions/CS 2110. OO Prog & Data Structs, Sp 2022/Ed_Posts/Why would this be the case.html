 Why would IAccnt w = (IAccnt) (new Accnt()); act differently than IAcct w = (IAccnt) (New Accnt()); because they are both of type Account.  Why would the runtime error occur for only one and not both?

  I don’t see a difference in the code you wrote in your question? They both WILL compile but fail at run time

   so the second two examples would behave the same? the slide made it seem like they didn't.

    where in the slide does it say that? if you’re referring to a3, a3’s run time type is Iacct which isn’t what you did above
