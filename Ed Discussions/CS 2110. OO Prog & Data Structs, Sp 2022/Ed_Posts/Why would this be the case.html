  Why would IAccnt w = (IAccnt) (new Accnt()); act differently than IAcct w = (IAccnt) (New Accnt()); because they are both of type Account.  Why would the runtime error occur for only one and not both?

  I don’t see a difference in the code you wrote in your question? They both WILL compile but fail at run time
