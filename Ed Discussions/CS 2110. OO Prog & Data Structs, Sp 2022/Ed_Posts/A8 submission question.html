 I did see in the handout that the staff won't look at code for A8, but should we leave our specifications for our own helper methods in there?
</p>
<p>
 Also, our .zip of the submit package just contains Heap.java, Path.java, and Pollack.java, right?

  You should have spec for your helper methods. And yes your submit zip contains what you mentioned.
