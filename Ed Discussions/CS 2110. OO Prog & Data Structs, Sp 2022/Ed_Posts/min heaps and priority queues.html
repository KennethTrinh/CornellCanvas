 In the prelim 2 study guide it says we should be able to understand "how a min-heap can be used to implement a priority queue" but I can't figure it out.
</p>
<p>
 Wouldn't the elements with the highest priority be at the top of the queue? so why is it not represented with a max-heap?

  "The item with the smallest priority is removed" sounds like a min heap to me (With the root being the min value (First out)

   Ok weird, so in a priority queue, the lower priority items are done (removed) first. I assumed that the higher priority ones would want to be removed first.
