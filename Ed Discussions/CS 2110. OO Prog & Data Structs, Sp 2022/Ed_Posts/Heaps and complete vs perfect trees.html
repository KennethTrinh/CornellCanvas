 Why can't perfect trees be considered heaps as well? I feel like from a functional standpoint, perfect trees would work just as well as complete trees.

  A perfect tree IS a complete tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  Most complete trees are not perfect Trees.
 </p>
 <p>
  A perfect tree is a complete tree with as many nodes as possible in the last row
