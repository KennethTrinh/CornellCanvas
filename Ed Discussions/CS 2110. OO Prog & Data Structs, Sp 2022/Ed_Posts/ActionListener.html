  I get the error, "Cannot make a static reference to the non-static method startGame() from the type GameComponent" when I try to create the action listener for TODO 3. Not sure how to fix it.

  A
  <italic>
   non-static method
  </italic>
  aka
  <italic>
   instance method
  </italic>
  is defined in JavaHyperText. It is a method that is part of every object of a class. A
  <italic>
   static method
  </italic>
  is also defined in JavaHyperText. It is a method that exists in only one place, as part of the class not any objects.

 <paragraph>
  With that in mind, study the error message:  what is it saying? what is it telling you about how Java understands the code you've written?
