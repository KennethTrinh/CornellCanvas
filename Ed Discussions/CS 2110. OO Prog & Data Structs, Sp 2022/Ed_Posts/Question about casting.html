 <paragraph>
  In this question from prelim 1, one question is
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  D1 d = (D1) new D2();
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  d.f1();
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The answer is that it would use D1's method f(1), but would you necessarily need to cast d to D1 in order to use this method, or since D2 extends D1 would it automatically look for a method f1() in the superclass?

  So you would not need to cast it to D1?
