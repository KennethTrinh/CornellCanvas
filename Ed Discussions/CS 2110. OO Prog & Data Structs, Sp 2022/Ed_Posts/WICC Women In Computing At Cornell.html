  is an organization on campus that provides amazing resources and opportunities to ensure that everyone can be successful in computing at Cornell! We offer resources such as interview prep, homework help, etc. Below are some of our upcoming events (including the CS Partner Finding Social which is VERY helpful for 2110 students)! WICC is open to ALL :))
