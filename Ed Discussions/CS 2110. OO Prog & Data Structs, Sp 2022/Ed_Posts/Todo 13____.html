 I am getting this message when I try to run my code after attempting todo 13. I am not sure what this means.

  Let's read the stack trace!  See how on the 5th line it says "GameMain.makeSliderPanel (GameMain.java:210)"?  That means on line 210 of GameMain you wrote some incorrect code.  The message contained in the exception appears on the first line: "adding container's parent to itself".  Think about what that could mean, and how your code on line 210 could be related.
