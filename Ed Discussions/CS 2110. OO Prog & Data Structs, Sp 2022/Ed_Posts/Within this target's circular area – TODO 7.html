  Just wanted to double check the literal meaning of "within" in TODO 7 before submitting:
 </paragraph>
 <list style="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    only coordinates INSIDE the target's circular area should be valid, in which case the formula would be (...) &lt; (...)
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
 </list>
 <paragraph>
  OR
 </paragraph>
 <list style="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    coordinates INSIDE the target's circular area and ON the circle should be valid, in which case the formula would be (...) &lt;= (...)
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
 </list>
 <paragraph>
  Which one is the correct interpretation? Thank you.

  Either interpretation works; the difference is almost imperceptible when playing in either case!

  To be very technical, it depends on OP's meaning of "ON".  Are the pixels at the very edge of the circle (furthest away from the center) "on"?  I.e. are
  <italic>
   they
  </italic>
  the border?  Or is the border the infinitely thin line just past them?  Actually Swing adopts the latter stance:  the border is the
  <link href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.desktop/java/awt/Graphics.html"/>
  infinitely thin line (3rd paragraph).  So I guess I would say
  <code>
   &lt;=
  </code>
  is actually the right answer.  But as the other staff answer points out, it won't really matter.  We'll accept either answer.  Probably only gamers with pixel-level accuracy would ever file a bug report about this.  ;)
