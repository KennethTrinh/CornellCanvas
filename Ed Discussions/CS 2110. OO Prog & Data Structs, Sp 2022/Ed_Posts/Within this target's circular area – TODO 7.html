 Just wanted to double check the literal meaning of "within" in TODO 7 before submitting:
</p>
<list style="bullet">
 <li>
  <p>
   only coordinates INSIDE the target's circular area should be valid, in which case the formula would be (...) &lt; (...)
  </p>
 </li>
</list>
<p>
 OR
</p>
<list style="bullet">
 <li>
  <p>
   coordinates INSIDE the target's circular area and ON the circle should be valid, in which case the formula would be (...) &lt;= (...)
  </p>
 </li>
</list>
<p>
 Which one is the correct interpretation? Thank you.
</p>

  To be very technical, it depends on OP's meaning of "ON".  Are the pixels at the very edge of the circle (furthest away from the center) "on"?  I.e. are
  <i>
   they
  </i>
  the border?  Or is the border the infinitely thin line just past them?  Actually Swing adopts the latter stance:  the border is the
  <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.desktop/java/awt/Graphics.html">
   infinitely thin line
  </a>
  (3rd paragraph).  So I guess I would say
  <code>
   &lt;=
  </code>
  is actually the right answer.  But as the other staff answer points out, it won't really matter.  We'll accept either answer.  Probably only gamers with pixel-level accuracy would ever file a bug report about this.  ;)

   Either interpretation works; the difference is almost imperceptible when playing in either case!
