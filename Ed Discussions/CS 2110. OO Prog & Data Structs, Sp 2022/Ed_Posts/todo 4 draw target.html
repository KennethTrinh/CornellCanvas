 I may just be missing something but where exactly (in terms of coordinates) should we draw the target if the game is active? The center?

  TODO 4 doesn't require you to do anything with the target's coordinates. You only need to worry about the rectangle's placement. You can just look at fillRect() documentation to figure that out. For the targets, you should simply call paintDot(). We are using the

   Ma√±ana principle
  </a>
  . We call a helper method paintDot() that will be implemented later.

    We tried g.paintDot() and also paintDot(g) but we keep getting this error that says The method paintDot(Graphics) is undefined for the type GameComponent

     paintDot is a method in class Target so to call it you need to create an object of the class target.  But the target has already been defined as a field in class GameComponent, so you can just call target.paintDot(g).
