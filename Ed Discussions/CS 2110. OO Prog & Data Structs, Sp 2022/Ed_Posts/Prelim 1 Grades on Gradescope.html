  Good morning, CS 2110.

  <break>
  </break>
  Scores for prelim 1 are now available on Gradescope. They are just that, scores. There is no letter grade (A, B, C, D, or F) associated with your score. At the end of the semester, we use your numeric score on the prelim to compute your weighted average, then we make decisions about final letter grades based on that average.

  Today is Saturday, 12 March. You have until Tuesday, 15 March, to file regrade requests. (You will get a notice about this from Gradescope.) Please note that we wrote detailed rubrics for each question, and each question is graded as consistently as possible. However, we are all human and do make mistakes sometimes. The regrade facility helps you to report the mistakes and the graders to fix them.

  In asking for regrades on Gradescope, please note the following rules.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  0. We will not publish a solution to the 5:30 and 7:30 prelims. Each rubric on Gradescope provides enough information for you to know what a good answer is.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  1. Your regrade request needs to concisely and correctly identify an error in grading. Simply asking for more points is out of bounds.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  2. Do not enter into an discussion with the regrader. Please do not reply "Thank you" or anything like that: your "Thank you" is presented by Gradescope to the course staff as just another regrade request to answer.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  3. Ask for regrades on individual questions, not on a bunch of questions together.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  After the regrade process has concluded, we will post some statistics about how scores were distributed on the exam, and we will offer some informal advice about how to interpret your score as a letter grade.
