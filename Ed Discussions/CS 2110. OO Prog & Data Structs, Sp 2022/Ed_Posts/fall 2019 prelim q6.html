  I'm looking at the solution and don't understand some parts.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I don't understand step 1, "with default values for fields that are not assigned in their declaration". What is declaration referring to?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I don't understand step 3. "Use as value of the expression a pointer to the new object (i.e. the name that was written in the tab of the new object)"
 </paragraph>
 <list style="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    Is there a typo here? What does "use as value" mean? Also what does the i.e. part mean? I don't understand the wording
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
 </list>

  For step 1, it just means that you create a new object of type ABC with default fields. In step 2, you actually execute the constructor call, so you don't have to worry about the actual field values yet.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For step 3, another way to phrase it is that the new expression evaluates to the pointer / address of the new object.

  For step 1, what does “that are not assigned in their declaration” mean though? Still confused about that. Thanks!

  Consider the following class declaration:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  class A {
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  String name;
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  int age = 1000;
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  }
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The field name has not been assigned yet. The field age has. age has been set to 1000 in the declaration. We will not assign a default value to age, but we WILL assign the default value null to name.

  Do all fields in a class ALWAYS have to be assigned a value by the constructor? For example, in the constructor for class A, public A(), you MUST assigned a value for String name;? You cannot leave it as it is? (without an assigned value AKA just leaving it as String name;)

  If you don’t assign the field then it will keep its default value.

  What would the default value of String name; be? Null?

  Correct. Object types are default value null and primitive types vary....int is 0, float is 0.0f. etc.
