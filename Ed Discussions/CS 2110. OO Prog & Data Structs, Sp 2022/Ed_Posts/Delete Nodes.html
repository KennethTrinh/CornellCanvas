  Hi, I am working on delete(Node n) and it seems like I am not removing the node from the list completely. To give an example, I created a list and appended nodes to get [2110, 2220, 3330]. After implementing my delete call to delete node 1, when I call
 </paragraph>
 <pre>        System.out.println(dl.node(1).value());
</pre>
 <paragraph>
  it returns 3330, which is correct. But when I print my entire list using
 </paragraph>
 <pre>        System.out.println(dl); 
</pre>
 <paragraph>
  it returns [2110, 2220, 3330]. I am not sure what I am doing wrong as I reassigned the values of the nodes, but the node itself is still in there.
 </paragraph>

  Did you make sure to reassign the 2110 node’s new next value and 3330’s node new previous value?

  yes, that's why my node(1) is returning 3330 I'm assuming. Both my print statements were after the delete call

  what does the tostring method print? If it prints the wrong list then you’re not assigning your next and previous values correctly

  I'll mark this as resolved. If you're not sure where your mistake is and want someone to help debug your code, please either go to consulting/office hours or make a private post.
