 Specifically, what is the difference between static methods vs methods and static fields vs fields? I read around online and on other resources but it still is confusing to me.

  The best way for you to see the difference is to look at this page in JavaHyperText:

  I found it by typing    static   into the Filter Field. If, after reading that, you still have a question, please ask a specific followup question.
