  How can we tell if our TODO 3 is doing what it is supposed to? I created an action listener, but the button doesn't do anything right now, so im not sure if I'm doing it right.

  This would be a good opportunity to skim the rest of the handout and release code.  Anything described there as something you still have to implement -- that would be something that won't work yet.
