 Does throwing an illegal argument exception cause the test class to return an error (red bar) with the message you wrote, or should the test class still pass (green bar) while showing the message you wrote?

  That depends on if you made a test with an assertThrows to see if it errors or not. If the conditions are met for the exception to be thrown and you aren't doing a test with assertThrows then you will get a red bar. Also, it should be pretty easy to figure out what's causing an error. Just look at the failure trace.
