  I compared the deadlines of different assignments on the 3-week schedule vs. "Assignments" webpage on Canvas. I am seeing that for several assignments, the ones on the 3-week schedule do not match the ones on the "Assignments" webpage. The "Assignments" webpage deadlines seem to be set in the Canvas system, meaning it uses the deadline to indicate if you submitted the work on time or late. So I am confused with which deadlines are the correct ones. I attached screenshots of what I am seeing.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  E.g.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  3-week schedule: A0 due Feb. 9, Assignments page: A0 due Feb 3
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  3-week schedule: A2 due Feb. 15, Assignments page: A2 due Feb 8
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  3-week schedule: A3 due Feb. 19, Assignments page: A3 due Feb 15
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  and so on...
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Note: I understand that making all of the deadline changes at once takes time, so I just want to know first whether I should stick to the 3-week schedule deadlines or the "Assignments" page deadlines.

  Oh, I have this question about the Canvas quiz (Lecs 1-4) as well. The Canvas system deadline is February 6 but the 3 week schedule says February 4.

  I'll just mention, CMS seems to be consistent with 3-week schedule...but yeah, a clarification would help.

  1. I just changed the 3-week schedule to clarify when a CanvasQuiz is available and when it is due.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. For programming assignments, use the date on the 3-week schedule and the CMS --they are consistent. I did just changed dates on Canvas Assignments to also be consistent.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  3. We didn't earlier worry about due dates on the Canvas Assignment page because it is due on the CMS. However, you are right, they should be consistent.
