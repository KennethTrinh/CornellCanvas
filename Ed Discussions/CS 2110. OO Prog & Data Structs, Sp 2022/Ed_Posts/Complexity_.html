 When solving for time complexity given the implementation of certain methods/algorithms using loops, do the respective time complexities get multiplied or added? Some further explanation on this would be helpful. It is kind of an extension of the question asked in #1788. Thank you!

  You have to understand execution enough to figure that out yourself! There is no hard and fast rule.
 </p>
 <p>
  Show us an example where you think it is one or the other and give your reasoning.

   Here is some of my reasoning with two examples:
  </p>
  <p>
   Since the statements in this loop take O(1) - linear time in the best case and O(n)- constant time in the worst case, this means that the total time for the loop would be O(n) in the best case and O(n^2) in the worst case. If this logic is correct, then I would think to apply the same thinking to the color() method, but maybe this for loop is not O(n)? That is where I am confused, I would appreciate it if you could let me know where my thought process goes wrong?
