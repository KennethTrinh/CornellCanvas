  According to the java hypertext, the first statement of any constructor we write must be a call on another constructor. If not, Java will insert super(). But what if the class has no superclass? What will happen in that case? Will the super() still be inserted?

  Object is the superclass of all classes, so in every class, this would be the case.

  Thank you. I have one more question. The hypertext said that if there is no constructor declared in a class (e.g., C), Java will insert this: C() {}. But when I deleted my constructor and ran the code in Eclipse, this insertion didn't happen. Why is that?

  Yes the insertion of this default constructor is "invisible." Whenever a class doesn't have a constructor declared in that class, the compiler generates this constructor for that class at compile-time.

  the insertion is invisible so that the programmer doesnâ€™t see it.
