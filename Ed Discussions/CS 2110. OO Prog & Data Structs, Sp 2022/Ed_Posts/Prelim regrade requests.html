  The original date for prelim regrade requests was Tuesday night, 15 March, Midnight. So we closed regrade requests today.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  However, Tuesday's lecture had an announcement slide that said regrade requests would be open until "tomorrow night". That was a mistake but we honor it.

  We just reopened the prelim for regrade requests. The deadline is TONIGHT, Wednesday, 16 March, at 11:59PM.

  Yes, it'll be closed to everyone after 11:59pm tonight. If you're thinking about submitting a request but haven't done so yet, we suggest you submit it ASAP.
