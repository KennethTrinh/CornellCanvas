 The original date for prelim regrade requests was Tuesday night, 15 March, Midnight. So we closed regrade requests today.
</p>
<p>
 However, Tuesday's lecture had an announcement slide that said regrade requests would be open until "tomorrow night". That was a mistake but we honor it.

 We just reopened the prelim for regrade requests. The deadline is TONIGHT, Wednesday, 16 March, at 11:59PM.

  if we took the conflict prelim 2 days after the regular prelim date, do we have the same regrade due date?

   Yes, it'll be closed to everyone after 11:59pm tonight. If you're thinking about submitting a request but haven't done so yet, we suggest you submit it ASAP.
