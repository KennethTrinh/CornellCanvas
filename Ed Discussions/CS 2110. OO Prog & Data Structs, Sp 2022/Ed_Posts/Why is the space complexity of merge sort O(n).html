 Is it because it always needs to create a copy of the the array? So would the space really be O(logn + n), because there is logn depth and only one extra copy of the array at any point in time?

  Yes the space is O(n) because a copy of half the array is needed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Please note that O(logn + n) is the same as O(n).
