  Is it because it always needs to create a copy of the the array? So would the space really be O(logn + n), because there is logn depth and only one extra copy of the array at any point in time?

  Don't delete questions like this. Others may have the same question.

  Yes the space is O(n) because a copy of half the array is needed.

  Please note that O(logn + n) is the same as O(n).
