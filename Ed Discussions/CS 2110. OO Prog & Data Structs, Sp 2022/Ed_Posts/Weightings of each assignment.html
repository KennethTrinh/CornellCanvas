 Is there a place we can see how much each assignment is worth? I know it varies from 1% to 6% but is there a specific weight for each one that we can see?

  No. You will see the weights as the assignments are made available.

 <p>
  A0 has the least weight.
 </p>
 <p>
  A2 and A3 are also weighted less than A1 and the later ones because A2 and A3 are straightforward and don't take much time. The later ones, on data structures are more involved ad require more reading.
