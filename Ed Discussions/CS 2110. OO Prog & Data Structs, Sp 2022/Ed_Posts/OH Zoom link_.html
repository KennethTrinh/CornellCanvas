 Hi I want to take advantage of today's OH(begins at 7pm) that provided by TA Yutong Zhu, however there is no zoom link or netID on canvas and I check the ED, there is no post for previous sessions. I wonder how can I get the access to it at 7p.m.? Will the zoom link show up automatically?
</p>

   Hi, it looks like there's a Google Meet link which you should be able to see if you hit "More Details" on the event in the calendar
