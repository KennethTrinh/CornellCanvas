 I was looking at the schedule and saw that there were two times for each prelim (5:30 and 7:30). Does that mean there are two different timeslots to take each prelim, and are we allowed to pick which one to go to? I have a prelim for another class on April 19th at 7:30 pm, so I was wondering if I could take the 5:30 prelim if that was an option.

  Everyone, please do not ask questions like this.
 </p>
 <p>
  We will assign you to a time --5:30 or 7:30-- but you will have a chance to tell us about conflicts and we will respond accordingly.
 </p>
 <p>
  We have been through this before and have procedures in place to handle conflicts. Please wait until the appropriate time, when we will deal with this.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks!
 </p>
