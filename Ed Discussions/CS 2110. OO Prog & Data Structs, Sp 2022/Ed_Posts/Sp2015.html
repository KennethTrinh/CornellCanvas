  From an OOP perspective, we want to encapsulate/hide information that the end-user doesn't need to know about. In this case, a user of the program would be concerned about the taxes of the building in the city, but not necessarily the specific values and addresses of each building. Thus, hiding the fields either by using a private or protected modifier helps achieve our desired encapsulation for OOP.
