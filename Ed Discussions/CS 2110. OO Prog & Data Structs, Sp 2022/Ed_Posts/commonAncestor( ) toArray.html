  When I call CovidRouteTo( ) in CommonAncestor( ) and use .toArray( ) on the list, I wasn't able to store it in a variable of type Human. I had to declare an array of Obejct instead. But I thought CovidRouteTo( ) returns a list of Humans?

  Please look at the specification of method toArray in the Java API documentation.

 <paragraph>
  Then look for another overloaded method toArray() that has a parameter. That parameter is used to tell what type of value to return. Give it as argument an array of length 0.
