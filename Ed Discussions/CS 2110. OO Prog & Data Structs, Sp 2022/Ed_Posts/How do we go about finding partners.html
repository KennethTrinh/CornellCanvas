 Some of us were unable to make it to the CIS Partner Social due to a time conflict. And I remember during class that Professors Gries and Clarkson heavily recommended we find a partner for future assignments and not struggle alone.

<p>
 So if we're unable to find a partner by A2, is there an automatic partner pairing system or a course-wide survey like the one used in CS1110 by Professor White?
