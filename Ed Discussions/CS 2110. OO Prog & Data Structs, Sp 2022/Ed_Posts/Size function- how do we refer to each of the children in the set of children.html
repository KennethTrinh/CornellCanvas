 Hello,
</p>
<p>
 Do I need to iterate over the Set of children in the method size?
</p>
<p>
 If so how do I refer to a specific element in a Set?
</p>

  Yes, you do it the same way the earlier code has it, if you look at the code given it shows you how to iterate through the children and how to refer to the child youâ€™re currently iterating through.
