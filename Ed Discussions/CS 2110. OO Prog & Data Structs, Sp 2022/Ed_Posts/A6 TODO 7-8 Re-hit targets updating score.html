 My score field is updating when a hit target is re-hit. I believe the issue is in either 7 or 8 but have no idea what the issue could be, since I set isHit to false whenever the click is not valid.

  I found a temporary fix by introducing a repeat field in class Target, but in order for this implementation to work, I edit method respawn() as well. Is this fix acceptable?

  I believe points will be taken off if there are changes made to existing methods/fields that are not marked as TODO.

  I am assuming that when you say "re-hit", you are referring to clicking the target multiple times.
 </p>
 <p>
  Do not set isHit to false when the click is invalid. This makes your target "hittable" again even when it has already been hit.
 </p>
 <p>
  (i.e., clicked on target, clicked off target so target.isHit= false, click on target again) would give you a score of 2 points.

   Yes, this makes sense, however I am still confused how to avoid increasing the score if isHit remains true. Should I introduce a variable in mousePressed so that if isHit is valid once, the score won't update again?

    Did you have an if statement checking whether isHit is false?
   </p>
   <p>
    Then, the target can only be hit once since it won't go through that conditional if isHit is true(already been hit once).

     I did, but in the wrong place. Thank you!
