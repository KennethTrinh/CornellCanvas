  No, for you can develop it from the invariant, wherever k is placed.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  However, we know from experience that it is easier to put k to the left. Here are some reasons:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1. You want to compute e as the middle value in the ? section. This is most easily done it k is before.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. Proving termination is MUCH easier with k to the left.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  3. There is no need to reference b[k+1] or b[h-1].
