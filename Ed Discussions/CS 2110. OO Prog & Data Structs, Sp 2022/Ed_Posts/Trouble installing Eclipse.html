 I've downloaded Eclipse and had to delete and reinstall several times because it kept crashing. For a few days, it was working fine, but when I opened it up again, I got this message. I then deleted Eclipse and downloaded again, but the same message appeared. (I have a Macbook Air with M1 chip so I've been downloading the 2020-12 version - but I have tried with the 2021 version and it just crashes). How do I fix this? When I try to click reopen, I just get the same message again.

   I'm not really sure what fixed my issue, but yes my eclipse works for now. I went to a TA for help and downloaded it with him, so that should probably help.

   Perhaps I can help you at 11:10.

   At that time, start a zoom meeting going and email me the link

    This might be a problem with rosetta, you should try to call apple if you canâ€™t come up with a solution
