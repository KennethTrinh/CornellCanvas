 I was confused on the wording for the Group C test case.  What does it mean by "This will require first creating two PhD objects using the first constructor and then checking that the new constructor sets all 6 fields properly "  Are we supposed to compare the result of the first constructor to the second one in an assert statement?  How would we account for the fact that in the first constructor the advisors are null but in the second they will have values?

  No. The point is that in order to add an advisor as an argument to the second constructor, you first need to create two PhD objects to be the advisors.
