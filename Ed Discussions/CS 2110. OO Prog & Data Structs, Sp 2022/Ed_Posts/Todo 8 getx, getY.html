 The specifications say that we can use MouseEvent.getX and .getY to see where the mouse is. This is giving me an error. More significantly, I don't understand how we are to tell where a mouse was clicked. I read in the documentation that MOUSE_CLICKED event will be sent, but I don't see how we can find where and when this happens.

  Isnâ€™t an event the parameter for that function? Just do .getX() and .getY() on that parameter.
