 Hi, I just wanted to know if the zoom lectures were going to be recorded and posted online afterwards or not. Iâ€™m in a different time zone currently so it would be difficult for me to attend the zoom meetings in real time.

 Thank you!

  The first one will be recorded.
 </p>
 <p>
  The later ones will not be recorded because they are optional Q&amp;A sessions.

   After the first two weeks, are the in-person lectures going to be recorded?
