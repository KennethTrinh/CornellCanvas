  Hi, I just wanted to know if the zoom lectures were going to be recorded and posted online afterwards or not. Iâ€™m in a different time zone currently so it would be difficult for me to attend the zoom meetings in real time.

  Thank you!

  The first one will be recorded.

  The later ones will not be recorded because they are optional Q&amp;A sessions.

  After the first two weeks, are the in-person lectures going to be recorded?
