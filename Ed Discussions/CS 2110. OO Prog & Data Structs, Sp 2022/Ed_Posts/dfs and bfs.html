  For the second prelim, someone asked on Ed if we need to know how to develop dfs and bfs recursively, iteratively, or both. The answer was both. Do we still need to know how to develop both for the final? And by "develop," does that mean actually writing the code, or is pseudo-code okay?

  Generally pseudo code is OK.
