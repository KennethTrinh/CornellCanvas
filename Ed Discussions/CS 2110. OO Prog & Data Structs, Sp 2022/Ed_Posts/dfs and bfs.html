 For the second prelim, someone asked on Ed if we need to know how to develop dfs and bfs recursively, iteratively, or both. The answer was both. Do we still need to know how to develop both for the final? And by "develop," does that mean actually writing the code, or is pseudo-code okay?

  Yes, pdfs iteratively and recursively.

  BFS only iteratively.

  Look at how we developed them in class.

  Generally pseudo code is OK.
