 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 I'm having a problem with my code and everything I have tried to do to fix it hasn't worked. When I open my game and run it, the score starts as True instead of 0. When we click the circle and get points it works, it's just when the score is zero. My instinct was to check methods start game, set score,  get score, and JLabel scoreLabel, but there appear to be no problems with those methods (which makes sense given you guys provided those methods for us). I don't know what other areas to look into.
</p>
<p>
 Thank you!
</p>

  Is it possible you modified the provided code in
  <code>
   createAndShowGUI
  </code>
  that initializes
  <code>
   scoreLabel
  </code>
  ?  That's where the label is initially set to zero.

   I don't think so, but instead of true, this appeared in the score, which I think might help us figure out what's going on:

  <p>
   Also, the window filled the entire length of my screen when created. Is that okay/normal?

    Not normal, not okay.

    You seem to now have code that is setting the text of
    <code>
     scoreLabel
    </code>
    to an object -- probably the GameComponent object.  Maybe you wrote
    <code>
     ... + this
    </code>
    somewhere.
   </p>
   <p>
    Look for all the places
    <code>
     scoreLabel
    </code>
    appears.  There aren't many.  One of them you are doing something like I just said.  That is what needs to be fixed.

     Thank you for your help, Professor Clarkson. It was a problem with the abstract function in the PropertyChangeListener to change the score on scoreLabel. Fixing it also fixed the window size problem because I believe the window was too wide to make room for all the text. Thanks again!
