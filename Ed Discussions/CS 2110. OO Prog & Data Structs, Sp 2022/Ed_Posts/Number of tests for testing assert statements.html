  I am trying to write tests for the assert statements using assertEquals. If I remove the tests that are redundant (as in testing the same parameter), I end up with 18 tests, which is less than 25, the number that the document seems to be advising.

 <paragraph>
  What could I be missing, and what do you advise I do?

  DOn't worry about the exact number of tests.

  Look at your assert statements and write tests for them
