  April 8 appears to have been a date automatically set by Canvas when the course was imported from a previous semester.  It didn't mean anything.

  I have provisionally updated the Canvas deadline associated with A7 to be the same as the 3-week schedule. However, please note that the actual deadline will be whatever CMS says at the time the A7 assignment is released.
