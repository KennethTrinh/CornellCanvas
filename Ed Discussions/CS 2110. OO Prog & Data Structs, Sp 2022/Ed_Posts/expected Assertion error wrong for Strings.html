  My expected Assertion when getting an assertion error seems to be wrong.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For this assertion statement for example:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  assertEquals("[A,B,F,G]", getNames(route2));
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The Failure trace says this:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  expected: &lt;[A,[]B, F, G]&gt; but was &lt;[A,[ ]B, F, G]&gt;
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  This is difficult to deal with especially for debugging, as for example in assignment 5 I had no idea what was wrong in my program, because Strings are not returned as they are inputted. I turns out that in my assertEquals() statement I needed spaces after each comma, but I had to guess this. My method was also correct, so the "but was" part also does not seem right.

  Why does Eclipse do this?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Is there a fix to this?

  You did NOT have to guess this. Take a look at the specification of method getNames.

  I understand that I can systematically figure it out by writing good code, but is there a way for the assertion expected statement to return the actual string?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  It's true I didn't have to guess it, but I would have found the issue faster if I could change this.
