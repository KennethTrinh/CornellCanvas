 My expected Assertion when getting an assertion error seems to be wrong.
</p>
<p>
 For this assertion statement for example:
</p>
<p>
 assertEquals("[A,B,F,G]", getNames(route2));
</p>
<p>
 The Failure trace says this:
</p>
<p>
 expected: &lt;[A,[]B, F, G]&gt; but was &lt;[A,[ ]B, F, G]&gt;
</p>
<p>
 This is difficult to deal with especially for debugging, as for example in assignment 5 I had no idea what was wrong in my program, because Strings are not returned as they are inputted. I turns out that in my assertEquals() statement I needed spaces after each comma, but I had to guess this. My method was also correct, so the "but was" part also does not seem right.
</p>
<p>
 Why does Eclipse do this?
</p>
<p>
 Is there a fix to this?
</p>

  You did NOT have to guess this. Take a look at the specification of method getNames.

   I understand that I can systematically figure it out by writing good code, but is there a way for the assertion expected statement to return the actual string?
  </p>
  <p>
   It's true I didn't have to guess it, but I would have found the issue faster if I could change this.
