 I am not sure how to figure out the order of adding the elements. Do you just draw out the tree, considering the array representation of it, and then bubble up/down starting from the last added element. Or do you bubble up/down as you add each element?

  I think you might be confusing BSTs with Heaps. For a this question, you should draw the BST that is created if the values are added in the order provided. The first value would be e, second would be h, and so on. There is no bubbling up and down.
