 Hello!
</p>
<p>
 We were wondering if the function isInSet() is suppose to be private? The function heading given says public but the handout mentioned that all added helper methods should be made private.
</p>
<p>
 Thank you!

  Either way. If we made it public, we don't deduct points for leaving it so!
