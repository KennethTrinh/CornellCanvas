 In this case, why do you do
</p>
<p>
 Animal obA = (Animal) ob;
</p>
<p>
 when you already checked to make sure the two objects are in the same class using getClass()?

  Because of the compiler time reference rule, if you tried just doing ob.name your compiler won't run since Class Object has no field called name.
