 While doing TODO 6, the old target dots persisted. The handout says to double-check that I fulfilled all the requirements for TODO 4. Looked over TODO 4 and everything seems right. What could be the issue?

  Unfortunately I just cannot imagine a circumstance in which both these things are true:  all the requirements for TODO 1-6 are fulfilled (including TODO 4), and old dots persist.  Perhaps it's worth revisiting your assessment of previous TODOs?  Consulting hours resume tomorrow.  Maybe worth visiting.
