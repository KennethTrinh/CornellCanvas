 I am having a problem with casting on rec 9. In my inner class next() method, when I create a temporary variable E t=n.val it gives me an error unless I cast it as E t= (E) n.val. Shouldn't this be unnecessary? But when I do that, it gives me a warning "Type safety: Unchecked cast from E to E". I also get a similar warning "DLList.DLListIterator is a raw type. References to generic type DLList&lt;E&gt;.DLListIterator&lt;E&gt; should be parameterized" in my iterator method. What does this mean?
