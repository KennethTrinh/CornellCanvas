 Hello! Here the base case is n==0 which goes against the precondition. I was just wondering if we are supposed to write code or make calls that break preconditions. I also noticed that in one of the testing questions in the 2019 prelim, the solution contained test cases that broke the precondition. In CS1110 we were told never to break precondition when writing code and I was just confused if that is acceptable.

 Thank you!

  The precondition is that n &gt;= 0, so n can equal 0. The expression n == 0 does not violate the precondition.
