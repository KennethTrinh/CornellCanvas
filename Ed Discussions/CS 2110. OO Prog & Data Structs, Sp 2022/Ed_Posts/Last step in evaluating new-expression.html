 The last step in evaluating the new-expression is:
</p>
<p>
 Give as value of the new-expression the name of the object, C@2.
</p>
<p>
 I don't really understand what that means, can I get some help here?
</p>

  When a new-expression is "evaluated", the value returned is the object itself, essentially a reference/pointer, which is stored in the variable.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the new expression is:
 </p>
 <p>
  Object o= new Object();
 </p>
 <p>
  then the variable s (think of it as a box with a value inside of it) will contain the reference/pointer to the object o, for example o@5 (which is a representation of object o at memory location 5). The important thing is that the variable contains a reference to the object, not the object itself.
