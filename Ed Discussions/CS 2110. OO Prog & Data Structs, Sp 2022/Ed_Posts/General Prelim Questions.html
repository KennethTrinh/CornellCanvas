 I was wondering if the practice prelims that are more recent are more likely to have similar style questions to this years prelim than say one from 2015? I was also wondering if/what classes are optional or cancelled as a result of the prelim?

  All the past prelims are fairly similar to each other in style of questions. Class is not cancelled on the day of the prelim.
