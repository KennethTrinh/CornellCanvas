  I am a little confused about what kind of comments should accompany the declarations of all fields. The example of what the comment looks like in the instructions are javadoc comment (/** */) but in Java Hypertext, the field declarations are shown to be accompanied by comments (//).

 <paragraph>
  Am I interpreting the instructions wrong?
