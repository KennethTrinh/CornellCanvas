  Hi, I'm planning on majoring in CS in the college of engineering, so should I switch into ENGRD 2110 if I'm currently enrolled in CS 2110?

  It is recommended that you enroll in ENGRD, as mentioned in lecture because the process later down the line will become simpler (if you enroll in CS 2110 instead of ENGRD, you might have to clarify to the college that you are using this course to satisfy that ENGRD requirement for the Computer Science major). However, after speaking with an advisor, as Tomer mentioned, it really does not make a difference and you will satisfy the requirement no matter which one you enroll in. Change it to ENGRD 2110 if it is not too much of a hassle.

  Yes switch to ENGRD, but wait a few weeks until the rush of adding and dropping cools down

  When I took 2110, I asked my Engineering Advisor if it was required to be enrolled in ENGRD 2110 to get the Engineering Distribution. The answer was no because they know that CS 2110 satisfies that requirement, so you don't need to switch from CS 2110 to ENGRD 2110.

  Professor recommended switching in lecture, easier if you do.

  The Engineering Advisor said there's no need to switch. Both classes will satisfy the requirement.
