 Using a Java interface to define an abstract data type: An interface consists basically of a set of abstract methods. We can therefore
 <b>
  think of an interface as defining an abstract data type,
 </b>
 where the syntax of operations on the set of values is defined by the abstract methods and the set of values and meaning of these operations are given in comments.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <b>
  Abstract data type (ADT):
 </b>
 type whose implementation is not specified
</blockquote>
<p>
 I don't understand this explanation. What is the purpose of the connection between interfaces and ADTs?

  Consider an abstract type LLList. Its values are lists of integers. It has two operations:
 </p>
 <p>
  append an element
  <break>
  </break>
  remove the last element that was appended
 </p>
 <p>
  Below is the interface. The two declarations give the syntax of the operations. What they do is given by the specifications.
 </p>
 <pre>interface LLList {

    /** append k to the LLList */
    public abstract void append(int k);

   /** remove the last element that was appended */
   public abstract void remove();

}
</pre>
