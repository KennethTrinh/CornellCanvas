  Using a Java interface to define an abstract data type: An interface consists basically of a set of abstract methods. We can therefore

   think of an interface as defining an abstract data type,

  where the syntax of operations on the set of values is defined by the abstract methods and the set of values and meaning of these operations are given in comments.

  I don't understand this explanation. What is the purpose of the connection between interfaces and ADTs?

  Consider an abstract type LLList. Its values are lists of integers. It has two operations:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  append an element
  <break>
  </break>
  remove the last element that was appended
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Below is the interface. The two declarations give the syntax of the operations. What they do is given by the specifications.
 </paragraph>
 <pre>interface LLList {

    /** append k to the LLList */
    public abstract void append(int k);

   /** remove the last element that was appended */
   public abstract void remove();

}
</pre>
