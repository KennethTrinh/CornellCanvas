 Are consulting hours going on right now? I have been in the queue for 30 minutes and the entire time it has said one person is in front of me.

  Others might be wondering the same. I'll make this public + anonymous.

  We're grading prelims now, so it's possible that those consultants are not available at this time.

    Unfortunately, I believe all consultants + TAs who were available at this time went to the grading session (unless someone specifies otherwise). They should be done around ~5 though, so if there's more sessions after that, they are most likely open. Sorry for not being more transparent about that!
