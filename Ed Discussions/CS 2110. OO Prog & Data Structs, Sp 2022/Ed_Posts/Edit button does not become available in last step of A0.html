  I'm on the last part of A0 where I have to fix eclipse so that assert statements are aways executed using this tutorial
  <link href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/JavaAndDS/eclipse/Ecl10Assert.html"/>
  https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/JavaAndDS/eclipse/Ecl10Assert.html . In the tutorial, it says that I have to clicked "Installed JREs" and then select my JRE, and the "edit" button will become available. However, in my case, the "edit" button doesn't become available.

  I'm unsure as to why this is happening, but I do know that I downloaded java and eclipse using the instructions on the course Canvas page. I only downloaded the JDK because it stated that the JRE would come with it though; should I have downloaded the JRE as well?

  Click once in the column where it says location on the JRE you have installed, that should select it

  as long as you made it so that your java compiler settings are configured to java 11 by the instructions given at the beginning of the class you should be fine
