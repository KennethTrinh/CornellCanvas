  Hello!
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I was wondering where can I find the recitation slides on canvas? I tried looking under the recitation option in the home tab but can only see zoom inks there.

  Thank you!

  Each of the recitation slides are linked to the recitation pages from the 3-week schedule and past-weeks schedule

  You should be looking at the 3-week schedule DAILY so that you can keep up with what is happening.
