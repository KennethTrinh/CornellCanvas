  bfs and dijsktra's are equivalent when all the edges have the same weight (see 7a). Here, we are looking for the least number of stops, regardless of their length. So each edge will have weight 1 (it takes 1 flight to traverse the edge). Technically, this is shortest path still, but it is sufficient to just use bfs and not worry about edge priorities.
