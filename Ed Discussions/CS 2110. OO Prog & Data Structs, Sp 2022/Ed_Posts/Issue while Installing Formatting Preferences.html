  I can't seem to find the "Java feature" button in the Additional Save Actions window. However the "Use diamond operator", "Use Autoboxing" and "Use Unboxing" checkboxes are available under the "Unnecessary code" section. Should I check them off here?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Furthermore, there is no "Boolean value rather than comparison" checkbox.

  Checking them off under "unnecessary code" is fine.

  The beginning of my unnecessary code settings looks like what's below. Are you on the most current version of Eclipse? And is this all of the settings you see on the page?

  Thank you! I have the 2020 version because the latest one crashed after I downloaded it.

  Yes, these are all of the settings I can see on the page.
