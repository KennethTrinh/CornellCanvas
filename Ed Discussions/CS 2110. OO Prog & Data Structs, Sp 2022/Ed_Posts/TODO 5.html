  I'm not sure where you had to hardcode any numbers. There are getters and variables for all numbers that you have to deal with for that TODO.

  When I use 1500 instead of targetTimeMIllis while checking for maxTargets it works.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  But the variable targetTimeMillis doesn't seem to work.

  why don't you compare targetCount with maxTargets? You don't need to directly work with the current time.

  Yep, in your deleted comment you were doing maxTargets*(1500/1000) which is just equivalent to maxTargets since 1500/1000=1 with int division.
