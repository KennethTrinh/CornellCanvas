 Hello, I ran into some kind of problem that I do not understand.

 Usually, I would select the test that I want to run and then run it, the bar would turn green if the test ran successfully. Now, I'm not even selecting any particular test but it's testing only one (testLoop1) and the bar doesn't turn green or red anymore. Also, that list appearing on the left side just started happening, I do not know what I may have done.

  You likely have an infinite loop. Look, your terminate button is red. I have circled it in the picture below(it is the picture you posted). That appears when your program is still running. Since you're in an infinite loop, it is still up. Otherwise, it would be greyed out once your code is fully executed.

   Also, look athlete box to the left of "testLoop10. That blue arrow means that that method is running -infinite loop.
