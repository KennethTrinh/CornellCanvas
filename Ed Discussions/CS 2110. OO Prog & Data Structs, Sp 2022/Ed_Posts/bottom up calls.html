 Why is the answer to part i 2? Wouldn't the bottom up rule tell us that we are going to look for the lowest level object with method m (which would be in class B)?

  To my understanding, new A(3) creates an object A that doesnt have a partition for B so the call to m uses object A’s m() — meanwhile in part iii, creating B and casting it to A results in an object A that DOES have a partition for B, so that call to m() uses object B’s method.
