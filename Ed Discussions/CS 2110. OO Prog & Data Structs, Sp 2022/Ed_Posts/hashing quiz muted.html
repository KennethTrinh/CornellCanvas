 I am unable to take the hashing quiz because canvas is telling me my scores are muted.  I don't recall ever taking the quiz... is anyone else having a similar issue?

    Do we have just one attempt on the hashing quiz? I opened it before realizing the pdf was available to solve before keying in the answers on canvas. Now it says muted. Is there a way to reopen it to key in my answers since it says it's still available until 11:59 pm on the 29th?
