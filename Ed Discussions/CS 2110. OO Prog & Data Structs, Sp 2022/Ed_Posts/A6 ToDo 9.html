  I am using an anonymous function for this part of the assignment. I'm using "GameScore" as the property change listener, and then updating the scorelabel using the setText method on getScore(). However, this still does not work to update the score. I'd appreciate any help on what might be going wrong here.

  If it's easier, you can also try posting the code in a private thread and we may be able to help.
