 If there is no precondition, do we not need assert statements? The gotBefore method does not have a precondition but the specification says p is not null. Should we just make sure p is not null with the return statement or an assert statement?

  if it has no preconditions, you do not need to assert anything, that means if p is null you must return false

   Hi, I tried doing this but it gives me an error saying "
  </p>
  <p>
   java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke "a1.PhD.gotBefore(a1.PhD)" because "tim" is null....'
  </p>
  <p>
   this is what I have
  </p>
  <p>
   PhD tim= null;
  </p>
  <p>
   Is this wrong?
  </p>
