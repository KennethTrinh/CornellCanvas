 For a5 we're supposed to submit both the covid tree file and covid tree test file, however, cms only gives us the option to submit one file. What should I do?

  Submit only CovidTree.java. Do not submit the JUnit testing class

   You're only supposed to submit CovidTree.java. The test file is there for you to extensively test your methods to ensure that edge/corner cases work for each method
