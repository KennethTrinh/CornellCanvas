  Im a bit confused about how to approach this, when I place my base case at the beginning its an infinite loop since its just infinitely calling covidrouteto(c) when human ==c, but do I place it inside my dt in children loop or after I am done looping my path

  There is no infinite loop like that. Or if there is, you have done something wrong.
