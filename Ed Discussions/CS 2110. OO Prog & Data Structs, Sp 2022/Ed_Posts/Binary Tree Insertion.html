  It's to ensure that we repeatedly go down the left and right subtrees of the BST, checking if v belongs. Although it seems silly at first to have the loop condition be "true," think about what would happen if we removed it â€” we would execute each line only once, which is a problem if the spot we want v to end up in is more than one level down.
