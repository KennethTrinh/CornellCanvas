  I am guessing you are talking about loops. Invariant is something that you want to keep true before and after each iteration of the loop. Loop condition is something that keeps the loop going until it is false.
 </p>
 <pre>// invariant
while(condition) {
         //do something
}
// Result
</pre>
 <p>
  <break>
  </break>
  You want the loop condition to be false eventually or your loop will run on forever.
