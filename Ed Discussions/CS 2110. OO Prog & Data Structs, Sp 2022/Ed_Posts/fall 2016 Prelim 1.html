  new Integer(7) creates an object of wrapper class Integer that wraps the value 7; the value of that expression is a pointer to the object. Remember, that object has two partitions. The top one is Object, below that is Integer.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Cast the pointer to Object. We now have a pointer to the object, but that static type of the pointer is Object.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Now call function equals in the object. The overriding/bottom-up rule says to use the one in partition Integer, which checks for equality of its value 7 with the parameter.
