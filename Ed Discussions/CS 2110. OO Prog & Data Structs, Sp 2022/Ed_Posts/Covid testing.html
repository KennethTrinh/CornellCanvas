 We have been asked by the vice provost to make the following message available to you:
</p>
<p>
 Dear Students,
</p>
<p>
 Following the travel and social activities in which members of our community engaged over February break, we are experiencing a rise in COVID-19 cases on campus. Last week, you should have received
 <a href="https://covid.cornell.edu/updates/20220224-testing-reminders.cfm">
  this
  message about the expectation that all students be tested prior to resuming campus activities this week, regardless of whether they traveled. If you have not yet been tested this week, I ask that you please do so at your earliest convenience. You can either pick up an antigen test or schedule a PCR test at any testing sites across campus (see
  <link href="https://covid.cornell.edu/testing/"/>
  herefor testing locations and hours). Remember to upload your results through Daily Check. This is particularly urgent if you have friends who recently turned positive or you have participated in unmasked social gatherings.
 </a>
</p>
<p>
 Please also monitor yourself closely for
 <link href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html"/>
 COVID-19-related symptoms. If you are experiencing symptoms, please do not come to campus. Instead, access a COVID-19 test at a
 <link href="https://covid.cornell.edu/testing/symptomatic-testing/"/>
 symptomatic test site and/or
 <link href="https://health.cornell.edu/services/covid-19-services/covid-19-testing-care"/>
 connect with Cornell Health.
</p>
<p>
 As we all know by now, adherence to public health recommendations is the best way to prevent the spread of COVID-19 infection. Please continue to wear a mask when indoors and around others and maintain physical distancing whenever possible. Information about COVID-19 can be found on Cornell Healthâ€™s website:

<p>
 Thank you for doing your part to help keep yourself and our community healthy.
