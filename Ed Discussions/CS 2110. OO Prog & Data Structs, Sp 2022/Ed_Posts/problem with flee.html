  Hello, we have two issues with our flee. First, an error occurs saying we ran out of steps when we still have steps left, and also sometimes when Pollock arrives at the exit, she goes back and forth between the exit and the next tile. we don't know what could be causing it. Any idea please? Thanks.

  No ideas without seeing what you are trying to do.

  We need to see code in a private thread.
