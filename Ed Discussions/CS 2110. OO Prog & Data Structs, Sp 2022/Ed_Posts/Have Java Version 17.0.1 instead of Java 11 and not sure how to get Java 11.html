  Hello!
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I currently have Java version 17.0.1. However, I am trying to install Java 11 on my computer. I was able to install the Java 11 JDK on my computer. However, when I check the version of Java on my computer, it is still version 17.0.1 and not version 11. What should I do to change the version of Java to Java 11?

  It's okay to have a new version of Java on your computer. However, you must change the compiler compliance level in Eclipse. To do this, you have to go to Eclipse's preferences, click the arrow next to java in the sidebar to pull up a submenu, click on compiler, and change the compiler compliance level to 11. You should closely follow the instructions on the canvas page.

  I am trying to change the compiler compliance level to 11 using the Window menu item, as the instructions say. However, when I access the Window menu item, I don't have a "Preferences" option. What should I do now?

  I see that you are on Mac, it is a little bit different on MacOS. You need to click the bolded Eclipse button which would be towards the top left side. It's to the right of the small apple logo that brings up your start menu. Clicking Eclipse should pull up a submenu and then preferences is going to be there. The rest of the steps are the same.
