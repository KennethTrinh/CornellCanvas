 I know this is a more basic question but for A0, A1 I used the run function within Eclipse. Is this what we are always going to use (do we not need to worry about the terminal (for Macs))?

  Since Eclipse is an IDE you can use eclipse to run your code, last semester when we used atom (assuming youâ€™re from cs 1110) it was a text editor and not an IDE so we used the terminal.
