<p>
 for the CovidRouteTo method I keep getting an output with a list that has a space after the comma
</p>
<p>
 [B, K] instead of [B,K]
</p>
<p>
 is this okay?
</p>

  Not only is that okay, but that's what should be expected. If you look at the getNames() method that you use for testing, it returns the string representation of the humans in the list with spaces. Just read the spec for it.
