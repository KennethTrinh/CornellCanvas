  My reasoning for this was a bit different and I wanted to know if it was correct:

  I said the best case for insertion sort (an already sorted array) is O(n) which is a better time complexity than mergesort, can someone explain what this answer means, and whether my answer is correct?

  Yeah, I think your answer makes sense. In their answer, I believe "overhead" is just referring to the basic steps and other things independent of array length that can make merge sort slower than insertion sort, despite having a "better" runtime complexity.
