 Hi, I understand how to assert if a field is not unknown with !=, but I don't understand how to assert a field is unkown. I am getting an error that says "Type Mismatch: Cannot Convert from PhD to boolean" when trying to assert that a field is unknown with =.
</p>

  What does the class invariant say about a PhD being unknown?

   Read the class invariant. What does it say is the case when advisor1 is unknown?
  </p>
