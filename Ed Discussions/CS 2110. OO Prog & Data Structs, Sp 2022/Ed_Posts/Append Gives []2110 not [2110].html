 I don't see a comment about this anywhere, but I have been trying to figure out append for hours and for testing both toString and toStringRev with append, I get "[]2110" instead of "[2110]". I have changed it a million times and can't figure it out. From print statements, I've deduced that somehow the given test with one call of toString is going through toString twice, which doesn't make any sense. Meaning, if you make the very first line of the toString method print "hello" (outside the while loop), the given test case will print "hello" twice. Did anyone have this problem/know what I'm missing?

  Did you change toString at all? It's odd to me that "[]2110" would ever be printed from toString since we wrote that for you. If it was just toStringRev, then I would double-check that your implementation of toStringRev is correct.

   I didn't change it and just checked the file from canvas and it doesn't have a typo or anything, I had just copied and pasted from the given code so all the same.

    This is probably a better question for consulting/office hours. I'm not sure what could possibly cause that to happen. You can also put your code in a private post.
