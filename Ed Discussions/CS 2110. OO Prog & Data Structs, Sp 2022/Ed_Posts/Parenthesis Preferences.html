 Hello,
</p>
<p>
 I'm having some issue with the import and save preferences. It appears that they have all been saved and imported properly. I was able to import the .epf file and save it. In addition, I changed the Save Acrions preferences, and checked to make sure all 18 suggested were there. However, when running a program, they did not seem to apply. When going back, I checked to make sure these statements were saved, and they were
</p>
<p>
 In the images I attached, I included the statement x = ((((3)))); at the bottom of the code. When I saved and ran the code, some edits appeared to be made (adding a space), but the paranthesis were not removed.
</p>
<p>
 Is there an error with the way I uploaded the actions, or is there another set of preferences I should upload? Thank you for any help!
</p>

  Was able to fix this by changing the check box in "Save Actions - Code Style" from "use blocks in if/while/for/do statements" to "use parenthesis in expressions. Hopefully this helps.
