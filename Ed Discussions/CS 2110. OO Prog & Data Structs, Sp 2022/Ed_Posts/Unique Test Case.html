 If in the precondition, there are two invariants A and B, and there are two assertThrows statements for when A is True, B is False; A is False, B is True. Will the assertThrows statement for when A if False and B is False be considered unique?

  Please don't be concerned with such things, trying to count how many cases you have covered.

 <p>
  Just make sure that you test as many ways as possible of the assert statement(s) throwing and exception.
