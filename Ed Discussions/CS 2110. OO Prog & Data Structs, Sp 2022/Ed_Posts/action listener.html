 I am having trouble understanding the action listener with anonymous functions. How does the addactionlistener method override actionperformed in interface actionlistener?

  For that, you have to study your notes/ppt slides from the recitation on anonymous functions.

  You were shown how Java actually replace that anonymous function by an anonymous class that contains the function.
