  I am having a bit of a difficulty trying to figure out how to implement the code for Duplicate. I am assuming I can't use Integer.valueOf(), but I am failing to recognize how get the value of how many times I need to duplicate something using String methods only.

  You have a number in character form, such as '5' using this is there any way you can use the ascii value of '0' to help?
