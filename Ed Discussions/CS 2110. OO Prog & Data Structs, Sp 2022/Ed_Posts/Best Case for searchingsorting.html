 The study guide says that we need to know the average/worst case complexity for search and sort algorithms. Does this mean we dont need to know best case complexities? Also to confirm, "average" is the same as the "expected" complexity?

  Also one more follow up: do we need to know stability as well?

  What you need to know about stability is what it is, and which sorting algorithms are stable and which ones are not. Understanding the high-level algorithms behind these will help you remember them.

   You need to know stability, you need to know best case (I've seen a question on it) , average is the same as expected yes.
