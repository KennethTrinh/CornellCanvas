 I was ill during lectures 16 and 17 and now going back to panapto to catch up I realize there are no recordings for lectures 16 and 17...
</p>
<p>
 Is there anywhere I can find extra material on this and will this be covered in depth on prelim 2
</p>

  Sorry, there are no old lectures on GUIs that we can show you.

  And JavaHyperText has nothing on GUIS.
 </p>
 <p>
  You will have to learn the material from lecture slides, through the Java tutorial videos, through the GUI assignment.
