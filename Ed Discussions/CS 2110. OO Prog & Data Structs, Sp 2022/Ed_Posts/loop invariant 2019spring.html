  How do we decide which list is supposed to be empty?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  why couldnt this be h =0; m = b.length; t = b.length;

  No, let's go through it together.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  These are our initial declerations based on the Invariant and precondition:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  We know b[0...h] must be empty (nothing is sorted yet) so using follower - first we know h+1 - 0 = 0, so h = -1
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  We know b[h+1...m] must be the whole list (unknown region) so again, follower - first, we want m+1 - (h +1) = b.length, m +1 - h - 1 = b.length then m - h = b.length and we know h = -1 so m - (-1) = b.length then m +1 = b.length so m = b.length -1.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  We know b[m+1...t] must be empty (nothing is sorted yet) so again one last time, follower - first, t+1 - (m+1) = 0
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  t + 1 - m -1 = 0 and we know m=b.length -1 so t+1 - (b.length - 1) -1 = 0 so t + 1 - b.length +1 - 1 = 0 so t-b.length +1 = 0 so t = b.length-1 and we are done.
