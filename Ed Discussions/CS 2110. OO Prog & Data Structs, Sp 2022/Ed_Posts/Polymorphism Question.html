  I am reviewing the course materials from the beginning of the year and am at this question on Lecture II of polymorphism.

  I am a bit confused by it. I had thought that the "new" expression will yield a pointer to the object with its type being the one in the constructor call. By this logic, wouldn't v have access to method m because its constructor is type S?  Or does the CC in variable v's declaration mean it will only have access to CC methods since it is a supertype rather than a subtype?

  Basically, what is the point of creating an S object in class CC only for said object to not be able to use S's functions?

  It doesn’t compile because of the compile time reference rule so even though at runtime it might have the methods of class S because it’s static type is CC at compile time it can only call methods from class CC
