  After looking at A7 for a while now and trying my best to figure it out on my own, there were 2 things I wanted to ask about:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1) For the abstract algorithm portion [f = node in F with minimum d value], can this be found by looking at the heap (F) alone? I had an idea of simply using
  <bold>
   peek()
  </bold>
  or
  <bold>
   poll()
  </bold>
  , and my idea with this was that the minimum value should be at the top of the min heap. However, I wasn't sure if this would be enough to find the d value.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2) For adding elements to the HashMap and specifically regarding class
  <bold>
   Info
  </bold>
  , should we be finding the values that we have to input as
  <bold>
   Info
  </bold>
  's parameters? For example, I can assume that the new-expression for
  <bold>
   v
  </bold>
  's info would look something like this:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Info someVariable = new Info(0, null);
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  But do we have to find the respective values of
  <bold>
   dist
  </bold>
  and
  <bold>
   bkptr
  </bold>
  when adding other elements to the HashMap? If so, where should we start with finding these values?
