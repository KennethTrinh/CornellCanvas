 After looking at A7 for a while now and trying my best to figure it out on my own, there were 2 things I wanted to ask about:
</p>
<p>
 1) For the abstract algorithm portion [f = node in F with minimum d value], can this be found by looking at the heap (F) alone? I had an idea of simply using
 <b>
  peek()
 </b>
 or
 <b>
  poll()
 </b>
 , and my idea with this was that the minimum value should be at the top of the min heap. However, I wasn't sure if this would be enough to find the d value.
</p>
<p>
 2) For adding elements to the HashMap and specifically regarding class
 <b>
  Info
 </b>
 , should we be finding the values that we have to input as
 <b>
  Info
 </b>
 's parameters? For example, I can assume that the new-expression for
 <b>
  v
 </b>
 's info would look something like this:
</p>
<p>
 Info someVariable = new Info(0, null);
</p>
<p>
 But do we have to find the respective values of
 <b>
  dist
 </b>
 and
 <b>
  bkptr
 </b>
 when adding other elements to the HashMap? If so, where should we start with finding these values?
</p>
