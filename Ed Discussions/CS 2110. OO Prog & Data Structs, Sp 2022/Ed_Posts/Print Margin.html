  Hi! In a previous answer, we were told to use &lt;br&gt; for Javadoc comments that go past the 80-line print margin, and we were also told that it was okay for multi-line comments to go a bit past that mark. So if we write a Javadoc description and it takes up multiple lines, we're allowed to leave it alone? Thanks!

  Please use &lt;br&gt; when possible for the javadoc comments. Multiline comments refers to multiline comments that are not javadoc comments.
