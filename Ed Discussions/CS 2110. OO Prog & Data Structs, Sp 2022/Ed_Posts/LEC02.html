 In Lec 02, I noticed when trying to demonstrate the behaviors of the class Counter, you had to switch to shell. Why is that? Why couldn't we just use Eclipse?

  You COULD use Eclipse, but it would be awkward.
 </p>
 <p>
  You would have to write a method static method main and put code in that method, then run.
 </p>
 <p>
  Want to change what is tested or demoed? Change method main and run again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jshell let's you play around, trying things, demoing in a much simpler fashion.
