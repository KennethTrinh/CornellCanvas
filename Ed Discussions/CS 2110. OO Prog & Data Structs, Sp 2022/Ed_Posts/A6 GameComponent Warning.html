  My partner and I have completed all the TODO's for A6 but there is a persistent warning message in the GameComponent file. The program runs as expected with this warning, but my partner and I were wondering if we needed to use the first available fix (add default serial version id to selector type) to resolve the issue, or if there is something else that needs to be done. Thanks!
