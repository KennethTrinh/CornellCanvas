  Hi, I am in the process of confirming eclipse on my Mac. I am currently following the instructions for additional save actions but I can't seem to find the tab for java features that should be next to the other headings.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The screenshot is all I see. Please help so I can move on with the next steps.

  Those are all the tabs that should show for formatting preferences. Look for the two items listed under that heading in the PDF in the Unnecessary Code tab

  I am but I can't find them on my Mac. I don't have a tab labelled "Java Feature" in the preferences of my eclipse and I'm not sure what to do about it.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Also, I can't seem to find boolean value r t comparisons on unnecessary code. Here is a screenshot

  There is not supposed to be a tab labeled Java Feature. All that matters is the few items that should be checked as shown in the pdf. Those items should appear in the list under the Unnecessary Code tab

  The remove boolean value rather than comparison box seems to be missing. How can we get around this?

  You may be using a different version of Eclipse, which may show this particular thing in a different way. Look around. If you don't see it, just leave it.

  Do you have the latest version of Eclipse? I've heard that some people who have the 2020 version have been missing options. Make sure that you update to the latest version or reinstall from the Eclipse website.

  I have an M1 Mac Book Pro and have yet to encounter any issues. I would recommend upgrading if you would like.
