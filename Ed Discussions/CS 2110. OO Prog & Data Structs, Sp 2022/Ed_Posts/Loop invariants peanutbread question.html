 How do we figure out that we should use h&lt;n+1-t? This is to satisfy the part where the sizes should differ by a t most 1, right? but how do we come to the conclusion of h&lt;n+1-t? Isnâ€™t the other block from [0..h]? So, h-0&lt;n+1-t is the same as h&lt;n+1-t?

  basically this compares to see which side the c[k] should swap with based on  sizes of isBread() between 0 and h and between t and n+1 in order to have an even sandwich with similar amts of bread or elements on each side
