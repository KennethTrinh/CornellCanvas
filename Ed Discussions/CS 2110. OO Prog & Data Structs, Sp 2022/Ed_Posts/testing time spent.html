  Are we supposed to test the time spent on calling a method to certify it to be a constant one or a linear one??
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thanks!

  No, you shouldn’t test that. You should be able to tell the time complexity (linear or constant) by inspection.

  Could you elaborate a little bit more on what kind of inspection we should do? I'm looking at the a4 handout and I'm not understanding this part:

 <paragraph>
  • n= 0; k= 0; // once • k &lt; s.length() // n+1 times • k= k+1; // n times • s.charAt(k) == ‘e’ // n times • n= n+1; // at most n times
 </paragraph>

  At most n times means the worst-case scenario is n iterations, so the time complexity is linear. Constant time would be a constant number of operations independent of n. For more info, I would look back at the corresponding lectures and search up "time complexity" on JHT.
