  I'm having trouble fully understanding why these calls are made, especially with the return statements.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Would anyone be willing to go through the calls step-by-step?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thank you.

  Start with calling M(2). We're going to add this to our frame stack, so our stack looks like this: [M(2)]. We know that since n = 2, we will return 2 - F(M(1)). Since we can't evaluate M(1) yet, we call it.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Now we have called M(1). Let's add this to our frame stack, so now it looks like this: [M(1), M(2)]. We know that since n = 1, we will return 1 - F(M(0)). Since we can't evaluate M(0), we call it.
 </paragraph>

  Now we have called M(0). Let's add this to our frame stack, so now it looks like this: [M(0), M(1), M(2)]. We know that since n = 0, we return 0. We pop M(0) off the stack. Our stack looks like this: [M(1),M(2)]. Now we can come back to M(1). Recall that we return 1 - F(M(0). Since M(0) = 0, we return 1 - F(0). Now we call F(0) since we can't evaluate it. Push it onto the stack: [F(0), M(1), M(2)].

 <paragraph>
  Now we have called F(0). Since n = 0, we return 1. Pop F(0) off the stack: [M(1),M(2)]. We come back to M(1). Recall that we return 1 - F(0). Since F(0) = 1, we return 1 - 1, or return 0. Now we know M(1) = 0. We pop M(1) from the frame stack and we have [M(2)] on the stack. We come back to M(2). Recall that we return 2 - F(M(1)), or return 2 - F(0). We call F(0) again since we can't evaluate it. Push it onto the stack: [F(0), M(2)].
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Now we have called F(0). Again, since n = 0, we return 1. Pop F(0) off the stack: [M(2)]. We come back to M(2). Recall that we return 2 - F(0), and with F(0) = 1, we return 2 - 1 or return 1. We pop M(2) off the stack, and we have finished our function calls.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  So, going in order of paragraph, we called M(2), M(1), M(0), F(0), F(0)
