  Hi, I copy and pasted the two skeleton files into my A6 project, however, I can't seem to get rid of the red x on them and this came up in the console. How should I get the files to work? Thank you.

  I see that you have been creating
  <code>
   module-info.java
  </code>
  files in your projects.  Look in JavaHyperText, Eclipse, 0 Creating a Project, eclipseIntro.pdf (Java 11), at the 5th-or-so paragraph in all red.  Note the "
  <bold>
   don't create
  </bold>
  " instructions.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Recreate your project following those instructions. Re-import the source files. I am hoping that will cause this error to go away.

  Can you please post a screenshot to confirm that the project does not have that file?  Try not to let that problem pane overlap the explorer on the left.  It makes it hard to see other possibilities.

  Do you see the
  <code>
   module-info.java
  </code>
  below
  <code>
   GameMain.java
  </code>
  in the explorer pane?  That's the problem.  It shouldn't be there.  Please try creating the project again and making sure not to create it.
