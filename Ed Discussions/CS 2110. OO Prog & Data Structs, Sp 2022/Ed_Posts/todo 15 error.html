  So far, my scores are able to save to the file the way it should, but I am trying to cause an error to pop up, but I have been unable to. I wanted to ask what kind of event or action should cause an error. I want to make sure that my code is correct. Thank you.

  Change the file to read only. That will cause an error when you try to write to it.

  ^ Adding on to that, OP, make sure to review the handout, Step 5, page 9, paragraph 2.
