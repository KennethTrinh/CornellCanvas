 In A0 it says that "all lines will automatically be indented properly, if you installed the formatting preferences properly." What setting should we check to see if this is working?

  As long as your formatting preferences are set up correctly, including both the preferences file you were to download as well as the save actions, when you save your code, the indentation should be formatted correctly.
