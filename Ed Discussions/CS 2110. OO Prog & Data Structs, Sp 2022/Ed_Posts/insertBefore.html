 To call the insertBefore(), I'm trying to make a node which is one of the parameters in the method so I wrote it like this
</p>
<p>
 Node n= Node(dl.node(0), "8", dl.node(2));
</p>
<p>
 But I'm getting an error that the second arg can't be a string. How do I get it to have type value?
</p>

  It wouldn’t even let you create a new node outside of the DLList class, so making a node in your test case would raise an error since that’s an inner class, instead you want to somehow just pass in a node that’s already in the list, and then a value that you want that new node to be in your test cases.
