 Hello! I was wondering if we have to change our loops in our A4 code to follow this format? Or are we good as long as our code passes all the test cases provided in the recitation test code?

  You shouldn't have to change ANYTHING in DLList.java except as described in the handout. Once you make your class Iterable, this loop should work
