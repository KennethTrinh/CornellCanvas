  From the Handout:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  "However, your algorithm must stop as soon as the shortest path from node v to node end has been determined; once that is known, the method must not continue to calculate shortest paths. This must be done by putting an appropriate test near the beginning of the main loop body and returning the result if the test is met. Do not use a break statement. "
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Will points be taken off for putting an appropriate test near the END of the main loop body even if I do not use a break statement?

  Yes, points will be deducted because that is not the earliest time the shortest distance to end is known
