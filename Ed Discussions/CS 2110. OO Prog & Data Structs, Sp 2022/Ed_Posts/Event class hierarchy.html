 Hello! I am really confused in the difference between semantic event and low level event?

  Some examples of low level events are key and mouse clicks. They are low level because they are usually handled by your machine's OS. Semantic events are events caused by GUI interaction, like an ActionEvent that is fired when a button on screen is clicked by the user.

  For example, pressing a key on your keyboard is a low level event, but writing text in a JTextField is a semantic event.
