 I confused how to test the assertions for constructors. Javahypertext states:
</p>
<p>
 try {p.changeName(""); fail("no exception thrown");} catch (AssertionError e) {if (e.getMessage() != null) fail();}
</p>
<p>
 but do you need the if statement and how does this ensure that assertions are checked
</p>

  Refer to assertion throws in recitation 2. Also refer to post #336
