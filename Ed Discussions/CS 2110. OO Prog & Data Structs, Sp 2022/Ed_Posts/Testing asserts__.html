  I confused how to test the assertions for constructors. Javahypertext states:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  try {p.changeName(""); fail("no exception thrown");} catch (AssertionError e) {if (e.getMessage() != null) fail();}
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  but do you need the if statement and how does this ensure that assertions are checked
