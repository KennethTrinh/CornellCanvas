 Should we test the case where the list is empty, i.e. size==0?
</p>
<p>
 The spec doesn't mention the null list case, but it says k&lt;size of list and k also non-negative, so does this imply size of list&gt;0 is assumed?
</p>

  Yes, in other words, trying to find a Node within an empty list violates the precondition, and you can assume that that would never happen.

   You shouldn’t test that since if size = 0 and k must be less than size and nonnegative, k can’t be an integer and there is no other possible value to check at

   Think about it like 0… size -1 if size = 0 then 0..-1 is an empty range
