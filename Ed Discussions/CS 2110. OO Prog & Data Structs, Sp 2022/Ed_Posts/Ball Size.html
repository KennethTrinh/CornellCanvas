  Is this the correct size of the ball (initially), because when I do it like this I can't directly apply the distance formula in checkHit but instead I have to do &lt;2 * radius

  It's not something which I can look at a screenshot of and accurately determine by my eye.  The way to get this right is to understand the specification of the graphics method you are calling, and know that you have written the right code.  That is what the graders will examine.  They will read your code.

  A better way to phrase my question I guess is, in the documentation for fillOval it states this:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <code>
   width
  </code>
  - the width of the oval to be filled.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <code>
   height
  </code>
  - the height of the oval to be filled.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Does the width refer to the left to right of the circle? or just the left to the center?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If it's the latter, then in my checkHit method I have to do 2*r when using the distance formula and I don't understand why

  Width is left to right, as it would be with other shapes.  Consider a rectangle, for example.  The width of it is from edge to edge, not edge to center.  Google "width of an oval" for some helpful illustrations.
