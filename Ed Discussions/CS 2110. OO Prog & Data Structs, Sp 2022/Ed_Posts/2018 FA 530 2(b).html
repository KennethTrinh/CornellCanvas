 ”In a subclass constructor, you must explicitly call the superclass constructor.“
</p>
<p>
 I wrote false to this because I thought even if we don't explicitly say super() in the subclass constructor, this is automatically included by java, and only when we need to put parameters into is, like super(m), that we need to explicitly call this.
</p>
<p>
 However, the answer says, "You can use this(...), and if you leave that out, Java inserts one for you." What does "this()" have to do with these here?

  You are correct. That is a mistake. It should say super(...)
