 I'm having a bit of trouble trying to understand why we can claim that the two solutions are linearly independent? I thought that each equation represents a row, so the question is saying that 2 of the 40 rows can be used to express all 38 other rows.
</p>
<p>
 In other words, we see that the dimension of the row space is 2. Since the dimension of the row space is equal to the dimension of the column space , then that means that the column space should have a dimension of 2, which clearly contradicts with what the text says.
</p>
<p>
 Can someone explain why my reasoning is incorrect, why we can claim that the two solutions are linearly independent and, on another note, why dim(row A) = dim(col A)? Thanks
</p>

  Any solution $x$ solves all the equations of the system $Ax=0$, regardless the number of equations.
 </p>
 <p>
  The solution set imposes restrictions on the variables and not on the number of equations. The problem indicates that the whole solution set can be described through linear combinations of two linear independent nontrivial solutions, so $dim(nul(A)) = 2$.
