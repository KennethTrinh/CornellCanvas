  This is how I thought of it:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  From the given definitions of pk+1 and qk+1 you can see that  [pK+1, qk+1] = (1/10)A[pk, qk]
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  and then from this, if you plug in any value for k, let's say k= 2,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  you see [p3, q3] = (1/10)A[p2, q2],
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  and then [p2,q2] = (1/10)A[p1,q1], and then finally
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  [p1, q1] = (1/10)A [p0,q0]
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  substituting what you find for [p1,q1] and [p2, q2] back into the equation for [p3,q3],
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  you can see you get [p3, q3] = (1/10)A* (1/10)A* (1/10)A [p0,q0]
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  simplifying, you get [p3, q3] = ((1/10)A)^3 [p0,q0]
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  You see the value of "k" in the subscript of p and q on the right hand side is the same as the power A/10 is being raised to on the right side
