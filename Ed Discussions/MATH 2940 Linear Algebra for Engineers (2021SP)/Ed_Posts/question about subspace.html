 We know that one property that the subspace must satisfy is o in it.
</p>
<p>
 I am actually not sure what does it exactly mean. where I can find 0 in the x vector?

  The fact that a subspace must contain the zero vector essentially says two things: it is closed under scalar multiplication (another property of subspaces), and it is nonempty.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some examples: The xy plane is a subspace, and the zero vector within it is [0 0]. The zero vector in the subspace along the line y=2x is also [0 0]. The x-axis is a subspace, and the zero vector within it is [0].
