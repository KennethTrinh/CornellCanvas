 Is it ok if I did not use calculations to answer the question? I explained through concepts:
</p>
<p>
 I basically just stated that if u and v are linearly independent, then they are not scalar multiples of each other, so u =/= cv (where c is scalar). However, if u, v, w are linearly dependent but u and v are not scalar multiples of each other, then this means that w must be a linear combination of both u and v. In other words, w = c1u + c2v, so {u, v, c1u + c2v} is linearly dependent.

 On the actual exam, would an explanation like this receive full credit?

  You would receive partial credit.  The given solution is a more careful explanation, along the lines you sketch.

   I wrote a proof which uses the same reasoning as OP, but refers specifically to a theorem. Would the following receive full credit, or do we need to identify weights for w exactly as the solution writes it?
  </p>

   We know (by a theorem in the textbook) that if a list of vectors v1...vn is linearly dependent and v1 is not zero, then some vj for j&gt;1 is a linear combination of the preceding vectors v1...v(j-1). Since {u,v} is linearly independent, u cannot be 0. Also, v is not a linear combination of u.
  </p>
  <p>
   So, because the set {u,v,w} is linearly dependent, u=/=0, and v is not a linear combination of u, then w must be a linear combination of {u,v}.
