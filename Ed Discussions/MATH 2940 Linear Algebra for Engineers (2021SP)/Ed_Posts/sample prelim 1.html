<p>
 on the first question of the sample prelim part d) - I am confused how the solution went from a solution for the vector x to the parametrization with variables s and t. What are s and t and how did you figure that is the parametrization?

  From my notes for Lecture 6 (Feb 19):
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  Theorem: Suppose that
  <b>
   <i>
    p
   </i>
  </b>
  is a solution of a nonhomogeneous system
  <i>
   A
   <b>
    x
   </b>
   =
   <b>
    b
   </b>
   . Then the solution set consists of vectors of the form
   <b>
    p
   </b>
   +
   <b>
    q
   </b>
   for solutions
   <b>
    q
   </b>
   of the homogeneous system A
   <b>
    x
   </b>
   =
   <b>
    b
   </b>
   .
  </i>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  So essentially,
 </p>

 </figure>
 <p>
  is the particular solution
  <b>
   p
  </b>
  of the equation A
  <b>
   x
  </b>
  =
  <b>
   b
  </b>
  and from part (c), we obtained the general solution to the homogeneous equation A
  <b>
   x
  </b>
  =
  <b>
   0
  </b>
  , we simply add the two to get the general solution for A
  <b>
   x
  </b>
  =
  <b>
   b
  </b>
  . The s and the t are arbitrary variable names for the weights; they could be anything.
