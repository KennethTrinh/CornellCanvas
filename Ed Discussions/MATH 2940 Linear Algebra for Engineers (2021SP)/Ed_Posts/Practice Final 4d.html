  I wonder why is the solution not showing the work on finding the steady-state vector? (subtract from identity matrix and row reduce etc.) It seems that we can just take one of the column from P^2 in 4c and call it a steady-state vector, is there something I am missing here?

  Any means of finding the steady state vector is fine - even guessing - as long as you verify it satisfies the definition.  The answer is unique, if  P  is regular.  The fact that it turned out to be a column of  P^2  was, in some sense, just a lucky coincidence.
