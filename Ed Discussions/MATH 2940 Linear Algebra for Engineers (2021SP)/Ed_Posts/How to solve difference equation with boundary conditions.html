  Your general solution is a linear combination of the basis you find to (15), where the two coefficients are unknown. For the first boundary condition, you plug in k = 1 to your general solution and equate it to 5000. Do something similar with the second boundary condition. The two boundary conditions will determine what your coefficients will be.
