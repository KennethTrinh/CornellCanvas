  In this section, must z be orthogonal to the plane where y-hat is projected onto? Why or why not?

  z must be orthogonal. Recall that y-hat is the closest approximation to y which lies in the span of the basis vectors. The only way to minimize the distance from y to y-hat is if the difference between them is orthogonal to the space in which y-hat lies.

  For a more illustrative example, imagine a bird (y) flying above an approximately flat ground. If we try to walk to where the bird is, the closest we can get (y-hat) is directly under it, so the vector we draw from us to the bird (z) is orthogonal to the ground :) üê¶
