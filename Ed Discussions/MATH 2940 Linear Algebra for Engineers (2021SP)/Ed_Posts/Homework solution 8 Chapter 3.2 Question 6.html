  The steps are correct. Make sure you get multiplication/division correct when scaling rows.
 </p>
 <p>
  When $B$ comes from dividing a row in $A$ by scalar $c$, then det(A) = c*det(B).
 </p>
 <p>
  When $B$ comes from multiplying a row in $A$ by scalar $c$, then det(A) = $\frac{1}{c}$*det(B).
 </p>
 <p>
  Easiest way to memorize this is to try scaling a row on the identity matrix and relating the determinants.
