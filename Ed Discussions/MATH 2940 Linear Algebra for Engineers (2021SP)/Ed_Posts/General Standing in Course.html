 With Prelim 2 scores released and HW and quiz averages leveling out for the semester, what is a good way to know one's standing in the course?

  The median final grade on this course is usually a  B.  Comparing your prelim grades with the posted medians will suggest your approximate current standing.  The standard deviations give a sense of the spread.

   What does the spread mean in terms of grades? If you're a standard deviation above or below the mean, what does that translate to in terms of letters?
