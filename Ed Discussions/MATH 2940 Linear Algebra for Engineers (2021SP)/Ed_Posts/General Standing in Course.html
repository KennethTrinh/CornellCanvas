  The median final grade on this course is usually a  B.  Comparing your prelim grades with the posted medians will suggest your approximate current standing.  The standard deviations give a sense of the spread.

  What does the spread mean in terms of grades? If you're a standard deviation above or below the mean, what does that translate to in terms of letters?
