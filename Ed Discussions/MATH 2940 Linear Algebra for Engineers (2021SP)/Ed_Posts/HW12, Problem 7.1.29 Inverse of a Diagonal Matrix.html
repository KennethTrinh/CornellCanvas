 I don't remember if this ever came up during the course when we were talking about diagonal matrices and whatnot, but are inverses of diagonal matrices also diagonal?
</p>
<p>
 I am doing HW12,  Problem 7.1.29 and I proved that the inverse of A is also orthogonally diagonalizable using this assumption that the inverse of a diagonal matrix is diagonal.
</p>
<p>
 Is the inverse of a diagonal matrix also a diagonal matrix?

  Yes, the inverse of a diagonal matrix is also diagonal. To find the inverse of a diagonal matrix, replace each term in the diagonal matrix with its reciprocal
