 Are there seating charts for the in person discussion sections? I am in DIS 202 in Malott Hall, but I don't see a seating chart anywhere.

  Yes, people chose their seats yesterday. If you haven't gotten your seat yet, please come to me at the start of discussion and I can show you the remaining open seats.

   My section TA took down where we first sat, the thought being we'd sit there every time after that.
