  Are there seating charts for the in person discussion sections? I am in DIS 202 in Malott Hall, but I don't see a seating chart anywhere.

  My section TA took down where we first sat, the thought being we'd sit there every time after that.

  Yes, people chose their seats yesterday. If you haven't gotten your seat yet, please come to me at the start of discussion and I can show you the remaining open seats.
