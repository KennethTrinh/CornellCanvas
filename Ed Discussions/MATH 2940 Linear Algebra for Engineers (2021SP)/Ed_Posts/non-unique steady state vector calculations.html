 The following is a problem taken from the AEW:

 Matrix $P-I$ has a 2-dimensional nullspace: $N(P-I) = \left\{\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \right\}$.
</p>
<p>
 So the steady state vector depends on the initial vector and is some combination of these two vectors. I checked the textbook for steady state calculations of non-regular stochastic matrices but could not find anything. Could anyone provide some insight on how to determine the steady state vector of a matrix when it is not unique, as shown in part (b)? Thanks!

  In general you would need to study how powers of the transition matrix  P  behave.  There is a systematic approach, but it lies beyond our current scope.

   So would the solution to part b be outside the scope of this course? Or would brute force be the expected method

    The solution you're showing seems incomplete to me.  I can't helpfully comment.
