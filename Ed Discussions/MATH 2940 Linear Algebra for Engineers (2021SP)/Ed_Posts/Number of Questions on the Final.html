 The exam cover says:
</p>
<p>
 Write your answer to each of the seven questions on separate sheets of paper, each clearly labeled with the question number.
</p>
<p>
 As you submit, carefully match each of the 9 questions on the Gradescope template with the location of the answer in your submission. Otherwise, you may lose credit.
</p>
<p>
 I was wondering if the correct number is 7 or 9?
