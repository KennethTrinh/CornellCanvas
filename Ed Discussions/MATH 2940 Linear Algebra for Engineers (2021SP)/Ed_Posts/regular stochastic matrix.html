<p>
 when determining if a stochastic matrix is regular, what is the procedure? the only thing i've seen so far is looking at $P^2$, $P^3$, and so on to see if the new matrix has all entries &gt;0. Is there any way to prove a stochastic matrix is not regular in this manner? Is there a way to determine this more efficiently? Thanks!

  Correct.  There are other approaches, but beyond our current scope.
