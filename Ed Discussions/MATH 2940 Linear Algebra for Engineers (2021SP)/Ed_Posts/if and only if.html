 is saying "if and only if" explicitly required to justify your answer in some places? for example, q3d on the practice prelim:

</figure>
<p>
 if I wrote "since A has two pivot cols, col(A) span R^2 and thus the transformation x-&gt;Ax is onto" would that still receive full points? it seems intuitive to me that if col(A) span R^2 then Ax is just a linear combination of the columns of A and thus Ax spans the vector space R^2 for any vectors x. Thanks!

  The added "only if"s ensure that those three properties are all true together or all false together, and are more justification than needed -- this is just to take care of justification before you know whether the outcome is true or false.

  Your answer would receive full points.
