  Is prelim 1 format similar to the sample exam provided? For example, will there be questions on the prelim asking to define a term or state a certain theorem?

  The sample Prelim was closed-book, so included some tests of memory.  This Prelim is open-book, so will not include simple memory tests.  However, as usual, when you justify you answers, it can sometimes help to state a definition or a result we proved.
