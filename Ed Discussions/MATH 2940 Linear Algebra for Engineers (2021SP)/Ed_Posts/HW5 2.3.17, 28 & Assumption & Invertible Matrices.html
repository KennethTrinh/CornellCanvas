  Can we assume that A (and B for 2.3.28) here is a square matrix? I didn't see any indication that it was.

  [EDIT]: Nevermind about the above, I didn't realize that "Unless otherwise specified, assume that all matrices in these exercises are n x n" applied to all the exercises and not just 1 through 10.

  Also, while thinking about that, I realized that we never really talked about inverses of non-square matrices (at least not to my recollection). Do non-square matrices even have inverses to begin with?

  Non-square matrices can have a left or right inverse but not both.
