  If a question says some matrix A (with unknown dimensions) has z number of eigenvalues, where z is some constant, do we assume that z is the list of ALL eigenvalues in the matrix (including those with multiplicity &gt; 1), or is z the number of distinct eigenvalues? Also, will this distinction be made clear on the exam, considering we are not allowed to ask questions during it? Thank you!
