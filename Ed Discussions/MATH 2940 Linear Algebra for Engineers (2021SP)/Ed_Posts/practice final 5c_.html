  For question 5c of the practice final solutions, why can we assume that Q is the matrix spanned by the orthonormal basis? I'm not quite sure how this problem was solved in general, so any help would be appreciated.

  I just found in my notes the theorem about orthonormal sets that requires Q^TQ=I so I think I have answered my own question
