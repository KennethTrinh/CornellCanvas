  This question is about Markov chains and long-term behavior, which is covered in chapters 4.9 and 5.6 and not a chapter included in the prelim. Are we responsible for questions like these on the exam?

  This question is not about Markov chains (although we will soon see similar behavior for Markov chains).  Part (e) is an application of part (d), although it's easier to understand that after our recent class about discrete dynamical systems, which is not covered on our prelim.
