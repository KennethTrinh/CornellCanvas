 What is the difference between different Bases for the same vector space? Is it just that if you scale some vectors in Basis B, you'd get a new Basis C? Or scale some other vectors in it/use different scalars and now you have Basis D?

  Different bases are linear combinations of each other, as defined by the change-of-coordinates matrix.
