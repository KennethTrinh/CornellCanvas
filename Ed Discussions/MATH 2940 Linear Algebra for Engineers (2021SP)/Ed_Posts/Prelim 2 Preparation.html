 I was wondering if I felt confident in understanding the approaches to answering all of the questions in sample prelim 2 will I be able to solve anything on the actual prelim 2 or is there additional content not covered in the sample that may appear on the real prelim.

  I have not seen the exam (nor have any of the TAs to my knowledge), so there is no way to give a real answer to this question (not that we would be allowed to say anything even if we had seen the exam).
 </p>
 <p>
  One piece of advice though: understanding the approaches to solving things in the solutions is important, but the most important thing is to make sure that
  <i>
   you yourself
  </i>
  can think through the problems and solve them. That is, it's best to look at the solutions after you have worked on it already.

   I am mostly confused because there was a post on here saying that prelim 2 covers up to 5.5 but the sample prelim includes a question about discrete dynamical systems from section 5.6. What topics are on prelim 2?

    The announcement from Prof. Lewis on canvas says that the exam covers up to and including 5.5 I believe.
