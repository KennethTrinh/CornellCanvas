  will an eigenspace, i.e. the null space of A-lambda*I, always be at least one dimensional, or is there a case where it could be zero dimensions? if it is always at least one dimension, is it because A-lambda*I is noninvertible and has nontrivial solutions (of at least one dimension?) to the homogeneous equation, or another reason I'm missing?

  Yes your reasoning is correct. If $Nul(A-\lambda I)$ was zero-dimensional, this is the same as saying $Nul(A-\lambda I)=\{0\}$ which is equivalent to $A-\lambda I$ being invertible and $det(A-\lambda I) \neq 0$.
