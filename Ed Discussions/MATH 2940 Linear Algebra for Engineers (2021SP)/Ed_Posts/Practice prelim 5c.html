  Would it be valid to argue using determinants?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  That is, suppose for a contraction that A is not invertible. Then det(A) = 0. Since det(ABA) = det(A)det(B)det(A), det(ABA) = 0, which contradicts the fact that ABA is invertible. Then make the same case for B.

  Yes, that is valid. Theorems 4 &amp; 6 in section 3.2 are what you use here, and $0 \neq det(ABA) = det(A)det(B)det(A)$ means both $det(A)$ and $det(B)$ are not zero.

  Would a similar argument about the unique invertibility work for this question? For instance:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If ABA is invertible, there exists a matrix C s.t. CABA = I, and by intuition, that matrix must be $$A^{-1}B^{-1}A^{-1}$$. Since this matrix is unique, A and B therefore must be invertible.

  You cannot do this because the term-by-term inversion requires you to assume $A$ and $B$ are individually invertible in advance. However, you can use associative property to "peel off" terms and infer invertibility.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  $I=C(ABA)=(CAB)A$ implies $A$ is invertible since the matrix $CAB$ is a left inverse and $A$ is square.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Right multiply both sides to get $A^{-1}=CAB$ and then left multiply by $A$ to get $I=(ACA)B$ so $B$ is invertible.
