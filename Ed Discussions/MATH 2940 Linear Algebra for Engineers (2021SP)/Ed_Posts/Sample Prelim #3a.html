 I am confused how exactly this explanation justifies that the set of 2x2 diagonal matrices is a subspace of M. I just said it was closed in addition and scalar multiplication, and the zero matrix is in the subspace. Why do we need to draw attention to the fact that the sum and scalar multiplication result in diagonal matrices?

  A subspace is defined to have all the properties of a vector space as well as being a subset of one. Since it's already a subset of a vector space the only properties you have to reprove are that the subspace is closed under addition and scalar multiplication (that is, if you take any two matrices in the subspace and add them together, the result is still in the subspace and if you multiply any matrix in the subspace by a scalar then the result is still in the subspace). What you said is equivalent, although it is more precise/thorough to say it the way they did (since the subspace in question is diagonal matrices).
