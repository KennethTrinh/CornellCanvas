 For this question, what property was used to pull out the 5? I thought if you wanted to pull a scalar out of a matrix, you had to divide everything in the matrix by that scalar

  See Theorem 3 on p.171. If the matrix on the left had 5 multiplying all three rows, you would need to pull out a factor of $5^3$, as the scaling factor only comes out one row or one column at a time.
