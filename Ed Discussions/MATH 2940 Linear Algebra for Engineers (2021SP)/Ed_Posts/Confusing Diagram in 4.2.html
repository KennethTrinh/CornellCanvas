  This diagram makes it look like the vectors in the Null space are all colinear, or at least coplanar. This isn't true for all Null spaces, correct?

  Null spaces are a vector space, meaning they can be defined as a Span of some set of vectors. So if that set of vectors is linearly independent and contains one vector, then all vectors in the Null space must be collinear. If it contains two, then they're all coplanar... and so on.

  If the Null space is just the zero vector, then it's just one point.
