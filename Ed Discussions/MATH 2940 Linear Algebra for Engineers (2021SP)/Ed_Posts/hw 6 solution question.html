  I am looking through the solutions for HW 6 and for question 26 of section 4.2: I don't see why this statement is not true:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Col A is the set of all solutions of Ax=b
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Does anyone know why this is false?
 </paragraph>

  $Col(A)$ is related to $b$'s, not to $x$'s. $Col(A)$ is the set of $b$'s where $Ax=b$ has a solution, not the set of $x$'s that solve a particular $Ax=b$.
