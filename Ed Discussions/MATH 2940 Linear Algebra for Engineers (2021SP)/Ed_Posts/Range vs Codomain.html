 Is codomain a subset of range or the other way around? I remembered from the lecture that codomain represents a set where the answers sit and the range is the set of all possible images produced by the transformation. However, when I looked it up on Google, it says the other way around.

  Range is a subset of codomain. Codomain is an easy-to-describe set of values for the output of a function, while the range is the subset of possible output values of a function (the image).
