 I can follow the proof that Professor Lewis did for the 2nd equation. However, I'm not sure if this is supposed to be an obvious relationship at first glance and, I don't seem to understand the intuition behind it. Could anyone explain, please?

  In the second property, choose  A = B^T, and use the fact that the row space of a matrix is the column space of its transpose, and the transpose of the transpose is the original matrix.  You then learn that the orthogonal complement of the row space of  B  is the null space of  B,  which is the first property.
