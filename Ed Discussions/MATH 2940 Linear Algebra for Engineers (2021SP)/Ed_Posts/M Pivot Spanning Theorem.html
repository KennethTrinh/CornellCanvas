  I have been thinking about this theorem for a while and there is something I don't get. Correct any part of this that is wrong:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  This Theorem tells us that
  <bold>
   in order for a m x n matrix to span Rm it must have exactly m pivot columns
  </bold>
  . The
  <bold>
   reverse (if it has m pivots it must span Rm) is also a true statement
  </bold>
  .
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  In case 1 he proves that if there are exactly m pivot columns the matrix
  <bold>
   must
  </bold>
  span Rm.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  My issues is in case 2. He shows that if you have the
  <bold>
   particular case
  </bold>
  where f is has a non zero bottom entry then the matrix
  <bold>
   must not have a solution hence must not span Rm.
  </bold>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  But that is a particular case, and
  <bold>
   if you choose an f with a zero bottom entry then it can span Rm
  </bold>
  . So then I see a contradiction because the theorem says you cannot span unless you have only m pivots, but it is possible to span if you have less than m pivots and a particular f with a zero bottom row.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Where am I not understanding correctly?

  Note: Ok I feel really silly now but I realize my mistake. The definition of span means it covers all vectors, not that it is consistent for any particular vector. By showing there is a case where it is inconsistent that shows it does not span all vectors.
