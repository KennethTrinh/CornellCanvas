 I have been thinking about this theorem for a while and there is something I don't get. Correct any part of this that is wrong:
</p>
<p>
 This Theorem tells us that
 <b>
  in order for a m x n matrix to span Rm it must have exactly m pivot columns
 </b>
 . The
 <b>
  reverse (if it has m pivots it must span Rm) is also a true statement
 </b>
 .
</p>
<p>
 In case 1 he proves that if there are exactly m pivot columns the matrix
 <b>
  must
 </b>
 span Rm.
</p>
<p>
 My issues is in case 2. He shows that if you have the
 <b>
  particular case
 </b>
 where f is has a non zero bottom entry then the matrix
 <b>
  must not have a solution hence must not span Rm.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 But that is a particular case, and
 <b>
  if you choose an f with a zero bottom entry then it can span Rm
 </b>
 . So then I see a contradiction because the theorem says you cannot span unless you have only m pivots, but it is possible to span if you have less than m pivots and a particular f with a zero bottom row.
</p>
<p>
 Where am I not understanding correctly?

  Note: Ok I feel really silly now but I realize my mistake. The definition of span means it covers all vectors, not that it is consistent for any particular vector. By showing there is a case where it is inconsistent that shows it does not span all vectors.
