  The text defines signals {u_k}, {v_k}, {w_k} as linearly independent if, for all k,
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  c_1u_k+c_2v_k+c_3w_k=0
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  has only the solution where c1=c2=c3=0. It then states if the Casorati matrix is invertible for at least one value of k, then the signals are linearly independent.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Why is it that verifying the matrix is invertible for one particular value of k implies that the solution has only the trivial solution for all values of k? (Would we use induction?)

  Each signal has infinite entries, and the "zero vector" in this vector space is an infinite sequence of zeros.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  $$\vec{0} = \{0,0,0,0,0,\ldots\}$$
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If you can show for 3 signals that there's a window of 3 successive indices {k,k+1,k+2} which is impossible to cancel out with a nontrivial solution, then you can never get a zero sequence by taking non-trivial linear combinations of the entire sequences since the values at those three indices will never be all zeros.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  To be more formal, let $\{z_k\}_{k=0}^\infty = \{c_1u_k+c_2v_k+c_3w_k\}_{k=0}^\infty =  c_1\{u_k\}_{k=0}^\infty+c_2\{v_k\}_{k=0}^\infty+c_3\{w_k\}_{k=0}^\infty$ for $c_1,c_2,c_3$ not all zero. Then
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  $$z_k = c_1u_k+c_2v_k+c_3w_k$$
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  $$z_{k+1} = c_1u_{k+1}+c_2v_{k+1}+c_3w_{k+1}$$
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  $$z_{k+2} = c_1u_{k+2}+c_2v_{k+2}+c_3w_{k+2}$$
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If the Casorati matrix is invertible here, then the segment $z_k, z_{k+1}, z_{k+2}$ is never all zeros if $c_1,c_2,c_3$ are not all zero, so $\{z_k\}_{k=0}^\infty =  c_1\{u_k\}_{k=0}^\infty+c_2\{v_k\}_{k=0}^\infty+c_3\{w_k\}_{k=0}^\infty$ is not the zero sequence.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thus the three signals $\{u_k\}_{k=0}^\infty,\{v_k\}_{k=0}^\infty,\{w_k\}_{k=0}^\infty$ are linear independent.

  So is it necessary only to show that "z_k is not 0 for c1, c2, c3 not all 0" for one particular value of k? And checking the invertibility of a Casorati matrix is simply an easy way of doing so?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Or do we necessarily need to show it is true for n consecutive indices given n signals?

  It has to be for n consecutive indices {k,k+1,...,k+n-1} given n signals where the first index k can be any convenient choice. The Casorati matrix being invertible means the non-trivial solution doesn't exist so it's impossible to zero out n consecutive indices with a non-trivial linear combination.

  If we only have two signals, can we use a 2X2 Casorati matrix?
