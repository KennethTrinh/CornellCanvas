 I was just wondering if there is a way to tell other than going through all the axioms. Also what are some examples of matrices that are not vector spaces?

  If you are working with a subset $H$ of an already known parent vector space $V$ such as $\mathbb{R}^n$ or $\mathbb{P}_n$, then it is sufficient to just prove $H$ is a subspace (only 3 axioms instead of 10), as all subspaces are vector spaces.
 </p>
 <p>
  Also, all spans of elements of a vector space are automatically subspaces and hence vector spaces (see Theorem 1). If you have a set in the form of a span (such as the Column Space of a matrix, or the parametric vector form of the solutions to $Ax=0$), you can even bypass the subspace proof and outright declare it a vector space by Theorem 1.
 </p>
 <p>
  If $V = \mathbb{R}^{2 \times 2}$ (which is a vector space) and
 </p>
 <p>
  $$H = \{A \in \mathbb{R}^{2 \times 2} : a_{11}&gt;0 \}$$
 </p>
 <p>
  then the subset $H$ is not a subspace (and hence not a vector space), as it doesn't contain the zero matrix and is not closed under scalar multiplication.
