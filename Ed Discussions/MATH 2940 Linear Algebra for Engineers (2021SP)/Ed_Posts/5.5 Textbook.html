  I'm a little bit confused while following this part of the text of 5.5.  I understand until the statement "the system has a non trivial solution". However, I'm unsure what it means when it says "Therefore, both equations in (2) ... in terms of the other". Could someone please clarify?

  Since $A-\lambda I$ is not an invertible matrix, this means the bottom equation should reduce to a row of zeros -- in other words the second equation is an exact multiple of the first and you can ignore one of the equations when solving for x1 in terms of x2.
