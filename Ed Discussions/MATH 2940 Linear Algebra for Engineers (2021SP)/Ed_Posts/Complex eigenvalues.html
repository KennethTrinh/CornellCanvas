  Is it possible to have a complex eigenvalue with a corresponding real eigenvector? I feel like the answer is no but I can't seem to come up with a good way to show why. Any explanation would be greatly appreciated :)

  No.  Suppose  A
  <bold>
   x
  </bold>
  =w
  <bold>
   x
  </bold>
  where  A  and
  <bold>
   x
  </bold>
  are real, and
  <bold>
   x
  </bold>
  is nonzero.  Some component of
  <bold>
   x
  </bold>
  is nonzero,  say  x_j.  But that same component of  A
  <bold>
   x
  </bold>
  is real and equals  wx_j.  Now divide by  x_j  to see that  w  must be real.
