  Does anyone know where to find the homework? I've gone through canvas and gradescope and, while the pages for the assignment itself are there, I can't seem to find the content to the problem set itself.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  At the same time, I want to ask if the Gradescope Quizzes will have the respective quiz attached to the assignment, or if the quiz content will be found elsewhere.

  I might be wrong, but thought that homework sets were referring to the assigned problems from the book (from the course schedule)?
