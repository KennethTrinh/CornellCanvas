 Why do elementary row operations that reduces A to B give a matrix B whose rows are linear combinations of A? Is there intuition behind why elementary row operations guarantee this from happening?

  When you multiply a matrix by something on the right, you end up taking a linear combination of its columns.

  Similarly, when you multiply a matrix by something on the left, you end up taking a linear combination of its rows. Doing a row operation on a matrix is equivalent to left multiplying by an elementary matrix (see p.108).
