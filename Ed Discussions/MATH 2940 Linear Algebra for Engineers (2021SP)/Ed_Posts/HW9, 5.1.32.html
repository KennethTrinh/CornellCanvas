 I am a little confused on how to do this problem.
</p>
<p>
 I recall from a previous lecture that rotation matrices for 2D have the general form:
</p>
<math>
 A=\left[\begin{matrix}\cos\phi&amp;-\sin\phi\\\sin\phi&amp;\ \ \cos\phi\end{matrix}\right]
</math>
<p>
 But I am having difficulty relating this information/concept to the 3D case for the homework problem.
</p>
<p>
 Any help/hints would be greatly appreciated!
</p>

  The good thing about this sort of problem is that you can visualize it. Instead of writing down any matrices, try imagining rotating the unit sphere in $\mathbb{R}^3$ about the $z-$axis. Are there any points that don't move?
 </p>
 <p>
  Remember that for a transformation $T:V\to V$, $v\in V$ is an eigenvector of eigenvalue $1$ if (and only if) $v\ne 0$ and $Tv=v$.
