  I am a little confused on how to do this problem.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I recall from a previous lecture that rotation matrices for 2D have the general form:
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  A=\left[\begin{matrix}\cos\phi&amp;-\sin\phi\\\sin\phi&amp;\ \ \cos\phi\end{matrix}\right]
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  But I am having difficulty relating this information/concept to the 3D case for the homework problem.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Any help/hints would be greatly appreciated!

  The good thing about this sort of problem is that you can visualize it. Instead of writing down any matrices, try imagining rotating the unit sphere in $\mathbb{R}^3$ about the $z-$axis. Are there any points that don't move?

 <paragraph>
  Remember that for a transformation $T:V\to V$, $v\in V$ is an eigenvector of eigenvalue $1$ if (and only if) $v\ne 0$ and $Tv=v$.
