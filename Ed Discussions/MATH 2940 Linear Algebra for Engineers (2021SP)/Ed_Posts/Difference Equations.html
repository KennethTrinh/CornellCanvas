 Can someone briefly summarize what difference equations are and what they are used for?

  Your vectors in this section are infinite sequences of numbers $\{y_k\}_{k=0}^\infty$, and you can add sequences to each other and multiply them by scalars. You basically treat them as an infinitely long column vector. They're typically used to model some kind of signal or function of time that is measured at regular intervals.

  The difference equation forces a regular pattern on this sequence by imposing a relation between each sequence value $y_k$ and its immediate successor values $y_{k+1},\ldots,y_{k+n}$, and this relation must hold for all $k$, not just a specific $k$. When the values $y_{k},\ldots,y_{k+n}$ are restricted by a homogeneous linear equation, the sequences which satisfy this relation (typically) take the form $y_k = r^k$ where $r$ is some (possibly complex) number, and the linearity of the relation makes the solution set a subspace so that linear combinations of homogeneous solutions are also homogeneous solutions.
