  I thought the set { [1 0 0 1], [0 1 0 0], [0 0 1 0] } spanned R^3, not R^4? And if it spans R^3, how can it be a basis since S is in R^4?

  It doesn't make sense to say that set spans R3, because they are column vectors in R4. You're also right that they don't span R4 because the dimension of the set is 3.

 <paragraph>
  S is a subspace of R4, but it is not R4 itself. It is a 3 dimensional subspace of R4, which is why its basis has 3 vectors in R4.
