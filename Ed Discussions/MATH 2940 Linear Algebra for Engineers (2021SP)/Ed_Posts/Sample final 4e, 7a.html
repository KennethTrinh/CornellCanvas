 How do we arrive at the conclusion that P^100 must have columns equal to the steady state vector?
</p>
<p>
 Edit: Also any chance I could get a solution on the typical trajectories in 7a? The solution didn't provide a sketch. Would be much appreciated!

  4e) It follows from $P^k \vec{x}_0 \approx \vec{q}$ for
  <underline>
   all possible
  </underline>
  probability vectors $\vec{x}_0$ when $k$ is large. Since every weighted linear combination of the columns of $P^k$ with weights summing to 1 gives you something close to $q$ when $k$ is large, it follows that all columns of $P^k$ are approximately $q$ when $k$ is large. See Perron-Frobenius on Slide 8/9 for Lecture 30.

  7a) The real part of the eigenvalue is positive, so you know the origin will be a spiral source. To get the spiral's orientation (clockwise vs counterclockwise), compute $\vec{x}'(0) = A\vec{x}(0)$ for an initial vector $\vec{x}(0)$ to see what is the direction of change with respect to time.  For example, if $\vec{x}(0) = \begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 0\end{bmatrix}$
 </p>
 <p>
  $$\vec{x}'(0) = A\vec{x}(0) = \begin{bmatrix}\phantom{-}1 &amp; 1 \\ -1 &amp; 1\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 0\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}1 \\ -1\end{bmatrix}$$
 </p>
 <p>
  Hence the initial direction of change $\vec{x}'(0)$ points southeast so the spiral is clockwise. It will look kind of like Figure 5 on p.319 but with the trajectories going outwards rather than inwards.
