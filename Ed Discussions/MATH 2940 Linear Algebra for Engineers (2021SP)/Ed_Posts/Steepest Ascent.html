 What is c in the theorem of steepest ascent? Why does x=c/||c||? Why is this theorem useful? Where could we use this theorem?

  I included this little fact to draw the analogy with maximizing a quadratic form over unit vectors.  The vector  c  is given.  In practice, it is the gradient vector for an objective function (think profit).  The theorem says that to increase the objective you should move in the direction of the gradient vector - the idea underlying the most basic algorithm in Machine Learning.  The proof is by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.
