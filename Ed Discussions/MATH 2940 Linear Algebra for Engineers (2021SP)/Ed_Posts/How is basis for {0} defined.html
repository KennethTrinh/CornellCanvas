  or it is not defined because zero vector is always linearly dependent?

  The basis for {0} is the empty set {}. From this we can see that the dimension of the zero vector space is 0, as was mentioned in class :)

  To avoid confusion, I (and the text) did not define the span of the empty set. If you're comfortable with that,

  But if you insist on a definition, the span of the empty set is {0}. With that definition, Vivian is correct. We could talk more on this, but offline would be better.
