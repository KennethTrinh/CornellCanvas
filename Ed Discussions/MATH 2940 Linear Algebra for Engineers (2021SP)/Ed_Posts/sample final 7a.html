  For the type of question shown below, do we only need to use one of the two solutions to find the entire general real solution? For example, in the answer key, it just uses the solution 1+i to find the general real solution. Do we need to use the other solution 1-i at all? Will the general real solution come out to be the same if I use 1-i instead of 1+i?

  Yes. If $A$ has real entries and you know one eigenvalue $\lambda_1 = a+ib$ with eigenvector $v_1 = x+iy$, then the other eigenpair is automatically conjugate to the original. $\lambda_2 = \bar{\lambda_1} = a-ib$ and $v_2 = \bar{v}_1 = x-iy$. Hence if you've solved for $\lambda_1$ and $v_1$, you automatically get $\lambda_2$ and $v_2$ for free since $A$ has real entries.

  However, do make sure you use the eigenpair for $\lambda=a+ib$ and not $\lambda=a-ib$ in the general real solution or your minus signs will be in the wrong place. If you ended up using the other eigenpair, then you can rewrite it as $\lambda=a-ib=a+i(-b)$ and flip minus signs accordingly.
