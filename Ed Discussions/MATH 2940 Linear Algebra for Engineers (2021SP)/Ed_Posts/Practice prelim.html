 this solution works to begin with. I thought if this is an explicit solution, we can plug x1=2 x2=1 x3=3 x4=0 into A, which will have the same solution as its non reduced form because it's row equivalent, so that it outputs vector (4,-1). However when doing so I get vector (8,-2) which I see is a multiple of what I expected so I must be missing something obvious. Thank you ~

  The matrix-vector product changes if you change the matrix by doing row operations.
