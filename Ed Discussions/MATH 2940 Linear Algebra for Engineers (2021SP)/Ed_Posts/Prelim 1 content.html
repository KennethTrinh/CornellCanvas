 I was wondering if it’s correct that prelim 1 will cover up to section 4.5 since this is what was announced, but I personally find it strange as we won’t have a chance to cover that section on any homework prior to the exam. I would logically think it would be up to section 4.4. Could you please verify if it will cover section 4.5?

  Yes.  Prelim 1 will cover up to Section 4.5.  I understand that students have had less time to absorb the material specifically in Section 4.5.
