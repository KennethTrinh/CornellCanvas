  In the future, is it possible to have the weekly quizzes available from 12am - 11:59pm Wednesday, instead of the 4 to 4pm timing on canvas? I know this is a bit finicky, but I just feel like the due time in the middle of Wednesday can make it easy to miss the quiz when the semester gets busy. It's okay if nothing can be changed now, but I just thought I'd give it a shot.
