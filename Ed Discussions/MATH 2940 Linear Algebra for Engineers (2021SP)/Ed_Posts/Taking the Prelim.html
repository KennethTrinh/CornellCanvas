 Just to double-check, will the test only be available starting from 6:30 pm EST and will be closed by 8:00 pm EST? As in, it isn't available to start within a 12-24 hour period where we can take the test for 90 minutes?

  Correct.  The test will not be available for an extended 12- or 24-hour period.
