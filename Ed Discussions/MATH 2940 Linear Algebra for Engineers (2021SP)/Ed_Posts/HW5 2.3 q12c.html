 If the equation Ax = b has at least one solution for each b in Rn, then the solution is unique for each b.
</p>
<p>
 I am confused by the statement. I thought the solution is unique means it has only one solution.
</p>
<p>
 Also, which theorem does this refer to?

  If you think the statement is false, you should give an example.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you think it's true, you should prove it.  (Most questions in this section concern the Invertible Matrix Theorem.)
