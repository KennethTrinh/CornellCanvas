 May I know if we could have more practice questions or exams available especially covering chapter 4? It seems that the only sample paper on canvas does not cover topics in chap 4. Please correct me if I misinterpret. Thanks in advance!

  You are correct.  The sample exam is mainly posted to indicate the style of prelim exams in this course.  Reviewing the lectures and text, along with past homeworks, constitutes the main way to prepare.
