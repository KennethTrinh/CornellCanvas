  I know that a transformation is onto when there are at least 1 solution and it's 1 to 1 when there's exactly 1 solution. I also can see it in terms of the standard matrix: rightmost column of AA not pivot column is onto and every column has pivot column is 1 to 1. However, I'm having a hard time conceptualizing why if I have exactly 1 solution (one to one) it doesn't necessarily mean I have at least 1 solution (onto). Is it because the definition of "onto" means I can make any image given to me with an input and having exactly 1 solution doesn't prove that?

  One-to-one means at most one solution.
