 Hi I was wondering if it was possible for the Professor to upload lecture slides the night before each lecture? I know it would help me to look over them the night before and then listen to him lecture the next day. Thanks!

  I do understand that some students would like to study the slides in advance, or to annotate them as I teach. However, I prefer that students try to make the most of live lectures - watching and listening carefully to explanations of fresh material in real time, hopefully seeing it come to life, taking very few notes at first, and circling back to the slides and text later. Reading the slides in advance turns the lectures into tutorials or office hours, and turns the slides into a text: we have those resources already. My aim is different. I realize it's hard - hang in there!   Adrian
