  Where can I find the study guide the textbook keeps directing me to when I am trying to check if I have done one of the odd number questions correctly?

  Solutions to odd-numbered exercises can be found at the end of the textbook.

  I believe the Study Guide they're referring to is a separate, purchasable resource from the publishers of the book, that explains some topics more in-depth (as well as having more detailed solutions). Every time they mention it is essentially just a little ad :)
