  For the exact same formula, why do we have different results for y? Why does the first example give a different y (the orthogonal projection), but the second example give a linear combination of vectors for y, which is essentially still y? How are the formulas different?

  Here, y is still (6, 1, -8)

  Notice that the formula for projection writes y-hat as a linear combination of the orthogonal basis vectors.

  We know if y is in the span of those vectors, then y can be expressed as a linear combination of them. Also, the projection of y onto the span is just y itself. So we can "project" y onto the span, yielding a linear combo of orthog basis vectors. So we use the same formula :)
