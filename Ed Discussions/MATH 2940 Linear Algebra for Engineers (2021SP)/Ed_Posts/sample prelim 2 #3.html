 I'm very confused on what's going with specifically question 3b and 3d. What does the PQRS notation refer to? Are they just representing the individual matrices in basis B?
</p>
<p>
 If so, how is this obtained?

<p>
 More specifically, where does 1*P, 3*P, 6*R, and -2*R come from?
</p>
<p>
 Similarly, why does F(P) = 1*P+0*Q+0*R+0*S?
</p>
<p>
 And what textbook section does this problem refer to? 4.7? 5.4?
</p>

  Since $\mathcal{B}=\{P,Q,R,S\}$ is a basis of $\mathbb{R}^{2 \times 2}$, every $2 \times 2$ matrix can be uniquely written as a linear combination of $P,Q,R,S$. You need to solve for the unique scalars $c_1,\ldots,c_4$ such that
 </p>
 <p>
  $$E=\begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 4 \\ 8 &amp; 3\end{bmatrix} = c_1P+c_2Q+c_3R+c_4S$$
 </p>
 <p>
  These four coefficients are the $\mathcal{B}$-coordinates of $E$.
 </p>
 <p>
  $$[E]_\mathcal{B} = \begin{bmatrix}c_1 \\ c_2 \\ c_3 \\ c_4\end{bmatrix}$$

   I think this is coordinate vectors and change of basis for this specific part and P, Q, R, S refer to the matrices in the basis B and you are trying to add/subtract/scale the matrices (make a linear combination) in such a way that you get the matrix given to us. I preferred using the matrix itself rather than the notation P,Q,R,S cause I think it helps visualize. for 3d, I think its bc F(A) = A^T but since you are doing it on P only the rest are zero, and it stays as P because P^T results in P.

    Ohh, I understand what's happening now with 3b. So the scalars are sort of arbitrary as long as they make up a linear combination of E. Got it.
   </p>
   <p>
    For 3d, I'm still sort of confused though. If P is
