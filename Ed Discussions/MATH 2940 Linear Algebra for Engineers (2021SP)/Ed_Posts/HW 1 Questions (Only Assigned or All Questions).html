  Hi for assignment 1, when it says that we should submit "Questions from 1.1".
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Should we only submit the solutions to questions 8,14,18,22,24,27, and 33?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Or should we submit every single question found in the question section of chapter 1.1 in the textbook? Thanks of the clarification!
