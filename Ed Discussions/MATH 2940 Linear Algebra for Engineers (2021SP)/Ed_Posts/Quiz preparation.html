 How do we prepare for the upcoming quiz? I finished the Homework 1(Exercise 1.1), but I don't know if I'm doing things correctly. If I did something wrong in my homework, I'm likely to do it wrong in the quiz.
</p>
<p>
 Is it possible to get homework solution before the quiz so that I can check my performance on homework to better prepare for the quiz?

  We will be posting solutions after the quiz so that people wonâ€™t use them to copy answers for quiz.
