  Can you give me an example where a linear transformation is not a matrix transformation?

  For now, we are interested in linear maps $T:\mathbb{R}^n\to \mathbb{R}^m$. It turns out that any such transformation can be expressed as a matrix transformation $T(x)=Ax$, where the columns of the matrix $A$ are $Ae_i$ for $i=1,\ldots, n$ the standard basis vectors of $\mathbb{R}^n$. This is something you'll learn in a few weeks, I believe.

  Here's a slightly more broad statement which might be interesting but maybe not easy to understand yet –– you should be able to understand this later in the course. It turns out that there is a notion of linear transformation between finite dimensional vector spaces $T:V\to W$. In this case it is still true that all of these $T$ are essentially matrix transformations in a well-defined sense that you'll learn later in the course. However, if we look at

  (for instance continuous functions $[a,b]\to \mathbb{R}$) there will be linear transformations that are not presented by matrices or expressible in terms of finite arrays of numbers.
