 The statement in the question is supposed to match exactly with the theorem in lecture 18, but the solution proposes a counter example. So where in the statement does it make it different from the theorem that says row-equivalent matrices have the same row spaces?

  Somewhat related question: why is (b) true when page 235 of the text says "Row operations may change the linear dependence relations among the rows of a matrix."?

  Sorry for the confusion.  As you suggest (and explain), the correct answer to 18(b) is False, and to 18(e) is True.  We'll work on fixing the posted solution.
