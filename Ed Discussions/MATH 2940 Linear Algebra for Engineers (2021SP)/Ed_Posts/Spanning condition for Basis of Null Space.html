  Since the conditions for a basis are that it is linearly independent and spans, why would $\begin{bmatrix} 5 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$ be a basis of the Null space of $\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 \\ -4 &amp; -9 &amp; 2 \\ 0 &amp; -3 &amp; -6 \end{bmatrix}$ like in lecture 14? I can see that it is linearly independent but it's not obvious to me that it's spanning since the number of pivot columns does not equal m. This was pretty clear the first time I learned it but I seemed to have forgotten now that I'm reviewing it again

  Perhaps try working through the example on p.202 to review.
