 I understand that calculating the steady state vector (for a stochastic matrix $P$) is finding the nullspace of $(P-I)$, but how would we be able to solve for the steady state matrix $P^k$ (for large $k$) if we want $P^kx \to q$ for every possible initial state x?

  The Perron-Frobenius Theorem ensures that if a stochastic matrix  P  is regular, then the matrix  P^k  converges to the matrix with columns all equal to the unique probability vector  q  satisfying   Pq=q.
