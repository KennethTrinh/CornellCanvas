  If a question asks for something but does not say to justify, do we still need to justify? In prelim 2 practice question 1a below, would simply stating the rank of A is 3 receive full credit? Or would we not receive any credit if we don't state the number of pivot positions?

  You will always need to justify everything. Solution without justification will receive minimal credit here.
