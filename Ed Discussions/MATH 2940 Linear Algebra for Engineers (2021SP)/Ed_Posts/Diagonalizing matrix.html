  When asked to diagonalize a matrix, is it sufficient to provide P and D? Or should you write out PD(P^-1).

  Given an $n\times n$ matrix $A$ that is diagonalizable (bear in mind they aren't always!), then to write $A=PDP^{-1}$, the columns of $P$ are a basis of eigenvectors of $A$ for $\Bbb{R}^n$. Suppose they are $v_1,\ldots, v_n\in \Bbb{R}^n$ corresponding respectively to eigenvalues $\lambda_1,\ldots, \lambda_n\in \Bbb{R}$. Then

  so that really $P$ has all of the information. In light of this, you may as well always write down $D$ because it is immediate once you have computed $P$. Notice that the ordering of the basis $v_1,\ldots, v_n$ affects the position of the entries of the diagonal matrix.
