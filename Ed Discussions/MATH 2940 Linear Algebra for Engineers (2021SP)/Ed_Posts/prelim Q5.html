  For question 5a, it says to write down a nonzero vector satisfying Ux=0. So that means the nontrivial solution, so there has to be at least one free variable. My question is, I had created a vector that was [1,-2,1] for the reduced echelon U. I had leading entries of 1, but I included 2 instead of another 1. Would that vector still be correct or does it have to be [1 1 1]? I guess a followup to that is does reduced echelon mean it can only have 1s in the entries or can it have 1s in the leading entries and then a few other numbers if it can't be reduced all the way to 1?

  Reduced echelon form has 1 in leading entries, 0s in all other entries of each pivot column, and can have any values in entries of non-pivot columns.

  I'm not sure [1, -2, 1] would work. Let U=[u1 u2 u3]. You know that u1+u2+u3=0, and

  1*u_1+-2*u_2+1*u_3=u_1+u_2+u_3-3*u_2=0-3*u_2.
 </math>

  So Ux=0 for x=[1,-2,1] iff u2 is the zero vector, which is not always true. For Ux=0 for all U, we need [1 1 1] or some multiple of that.
