 Hello,
</p>
<p>
 In regards to this question (4.9 q10):

<p>
 matrix P is deemed stochastic in solutions because:

</figure>
<p>
 I'm a bit lost at this explanation. How is explaining P^k stronger than stating there's a zero entry in the matrix, and is this the form for P^k because its first column is like the identity matrix's first column? What does explaining P^k express, and should this be our strategy for determining if a matrix is regular?

  For this question, if you do P^k, k &gt; 1 (since 1 is original P), if at any point P^k has all non-zero entries, then it is regular stochastic
 </p>
 <p>
  Example
 </p>

 </figure>
 <p>
  So here, P^2 does not have all non-zero entries and given the pattern shown, none of P^k will ever have that 0 be non-zero.  So the way they did it is sort of a short hand way of showing this relationship for all k.
