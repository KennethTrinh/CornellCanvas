 In q2 part f on the practice final, why did T get condensed into a 3x3 matrix? If T is a 3x3 matrix, how can it operate on vectors in R^4?

  It's like 5.4 page 292 in the textbook. What the solution isn't showing is finding the coordinate vectors of (0 1 0 0), (0 0 1 0), (1 0 0 1), as those coordinate vectors are the columns of the B-matrix of T

   But why wouldn't the solution be a combination of the coordinate vectors? For example if v1 = (0 1 0 0), v2 = (0 0 1 0), v3 = (1 0 0 1), why wouldn't the B-matrix of T be [v1 v2 v3]? I don't understand why it gets condensed to the 3x3 matrix for the final answer.

    because B-matrix of T is [(T(b1))b (T(b2))b ... ]. I think it's just the dimensions throwing you off. Since the B-matrix of T describes how T acts in B coordinates, you have to convert the answers you get from T(b1), TIb2), etc, which you called v1...v3, into B coordinates. B coordinate vectors only have 3 entries because the vector space spanned by B has 3 dimensions (there were 3 vectors in the given basis)
