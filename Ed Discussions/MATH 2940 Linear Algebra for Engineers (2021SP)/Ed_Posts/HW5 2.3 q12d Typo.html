  I noticed that part d of question 2.3.12 says
 </paragraph>
 <blockquote>
  lf the linear transformation (x) -&gt; Ax maps Rn
  <bold>
   into
  </bold>
  Rn, then A has n pivot positions.
 </blockquote>
 <paragraph>
  (My emphasis.) Should "into" be replaced with "onto," or is this a new property to consider? I'm betting it's a typo, but it'd be nice to know for sure.

  No - they do mean "into".   That's just another way of saying the codomain is  Rn.  They do not mean you to assume "onto".
