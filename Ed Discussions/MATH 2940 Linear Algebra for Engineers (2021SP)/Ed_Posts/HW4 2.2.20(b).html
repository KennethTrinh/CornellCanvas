  I'm a little stuck with this one. I thought I had solved it when I did
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  \left(A-AX\right)^{-1\ }=X^{-1}B
 </math>
 <math>
  A-AX=B^{-1}X
 </math>
 <math>
  A=AX+B^{-1}X
 </math>
 <math>
  A=\left(A+B^{-1}\right)X
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  and thought I could just multiply both sides by the inverse of (A + B^-1) to isolate X. However, I didn't see any property that states that the sum of two invertible matrices is also an invertible matrix (and a quick Google search also says the sum of two inverted matrices cannot generally be said to be invertible).
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I'm wondering if I am taking the correct approach to this problem, and any suggestions/hints would be greatly appreciated!

  Your attempt is reasonable but not the easiest way. You could instead try multiplying by $(A-AX)$ at the beginning instead.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Indeed you're right that the sum of invertible matrices might not be invertible. For instance, just take $A+(-A)=0$. This is certainly not invertible.

  I think both X and A+B^-1 should be invertible in this case as they make up the product of A, which is invertible.

  But just because A is invertible, does that necessarily mean that the product of the matrices that produce A are invertible as well?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  My lecture notes state that:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Any nxn invertible matrix A has the following properties... If an nxn matrix B is also invertible, then so is AB with
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  \left(AB\right)^{-1}=B^{-1}A^{-1}
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  But I don't think this necessarily implies the converse is true right?

  Yes, I think the converse is also true but not entirely sure.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Let C=AB. We know that AB is invertible, so inverse of C exists.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Then if you multiply inverse of C to the back of both sides, it becomes
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  I=\ A\left(BC^{-1}\right)
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  We can see that that A has some inverse (BC^-1) whose product makes it into I and hence, it's invertible.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Similarly, if we muliply C to the front of both sides. This is...
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  I=\left(C^{-1}A\right)B
 </math>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Once again, B has some inverse that makes the product into I, so it should be invertible.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I found this proof somewhere on the internet a while ago because I was wondering about the same thing. It seems to make sense for me, but please let me know if you think the proof is incorrect somewhere.
