 I'm a little stuck with this one. I thought I had solved it when I did
</p>
<math>
 \left(A-AX\right)^{-1\ }=X^{-1}B
</math>
<math>
 A-AX=B^{-1}X
</math>
<math>
 A=AX+B^{-1}X
</math>
<math>
 A=\left(A+B^{-1}\right)X
</math>
<p>
 and thought I could just multiply both sides by the inverse of (A + B^-1) to isolate X. However, I didn't see any property that states that the sum of two invertible matrices is also an invertible matrix (and a quick Google search also says the sum of two inverted matrices cannot generally be said to be invertible).
</p>
<p>
 I'm wondering if I am taking the correct approach to this problem, and any suggestions/hints would be greatly appreciated!
</p>

  I think both X and A+B^-1 should be invertible in this case as they make up the product of A, which is invertible.

   But just because A is invertible, does that necessarily mean that the product of the matrices that produce A are invertible as well?
  </p>
  <p>
   My lecture notes state that:
  </p>
  <p>
   Any nxn invertible matrix A has the following properties... If an nxn matrix B is also invertible, then so is AB with
  </p>
  <math>
   \left(AB\right)^{-1}=B^{-1}A^{-1}
  </math>
  <p>
   But I don't think this necessarily implies the converse is true right?
  </p>

    Yes, I think the converse is also true but not entirely sure.
   </p>
   <p>
    Let C=AB. We know that AB is invertible, so inverse of C exists.
   </p>
   <p>
    Then if you multiply inverse of C to the back of both sides, it becomes
   </p>
   <math>
    I=\ A\left(BC^{-1}\right)
   </math>
   <p>
    We can see that that A has some inverse (BC^-1) whose product makes it into I and hence, it's invertible.
   </p>
   <p>
    Similarly, if we muliply C to the front of both sides. This is...
   </p>
   <math>
    I=\left(C^{-1}A\right)B
   </math>
   <p>
    Once again, B has some inverse that makes the product into I, so it should be invertible.
   </p>
   <p>
    I found this proof somewhere on the internet a while ago because I was wondering about the same thing. It seems to make sense for me, but please let me know if you think the proof is incorrect somewhere.

   Your attempt is reasonable but not the easiest way. You could instead try multiplying by $(A-AX)$ at the beginning instead.
  </p>
  <p>
   Indeed you're right that the sum of invertible matrices might not be invertible. For instance, just take $A+(-A)=0$. This is certainly not invertible.
