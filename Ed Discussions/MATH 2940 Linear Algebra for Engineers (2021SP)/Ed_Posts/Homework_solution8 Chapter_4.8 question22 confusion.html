 I am really confused about why the linear filter in that qustion can be interpreted as matrix and how it solves the questions. What does z[k] evaluate to and how does it relate to the calculation in Example 3?

  First note the periodic sequence $y_k$ repeats exactly every 8 time steps so $z_k$ also repeats every 8 time steps. Thus you can wrap-around your indices back to 0 once they get past 7, and if you know $z_0, \ldots, z_7$, you can determine all other $z_k$'s. This is where the $8 \times 8$ system comes from, as that is exactly enough equations to determine the $8$ unknown values.

  $z_6 = .35y_6 + .5y_7 + .35y_8$ can be rewritten as $.35y_6 + .5y_7 + .35y_0$
 </p>
 <p>
  $z_7 = .35y_7 + .5y_8 + .35y_9$ can be rewritten as $.35y_7 + .5y_0 + .35y_1$

  If $v_k = cos(\frac{\pi k}{4})$ and $w_k = cos(\frac{3\pi k}{4})$, then Table 1 gives the values for $Av_k$ and the paragraph below tells you $Aw_k = 0$ for all $k$. Your input for that problem is $y_k = 2v_k+w_k$ so we can exploit linearity to get $Ay_k = 2Av_k+Aw_k$.
