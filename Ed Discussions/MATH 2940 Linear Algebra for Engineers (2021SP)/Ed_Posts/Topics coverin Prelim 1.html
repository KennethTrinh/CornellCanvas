  From announcements: "Prelim 1 is two weeks away: 6:30 - 8:00pm on Thursday March 25. It only covers material up to Section 4.5, although the classes on March 22 and 24 may also serve as helpful reviews. I have posted preparation advice and a sample prelim (with solutions) on the home page. "

   How is it administered? Does in-person people have it in in person or are we taking it online? Do we go on zoom while taking the test or just do the exam like the quizzes?
