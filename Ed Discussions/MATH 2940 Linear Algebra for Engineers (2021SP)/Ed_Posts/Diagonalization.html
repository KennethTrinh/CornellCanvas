  Once we find the eigenvalues and check that the dimension is greater than or equal to the multiplicity can we simply state that the diagonalization of the matrix is the eigenvalues across the diagonal?

  The dimension can be smaller, but is never larger than the multiplicity, in fact.  "Diagonalizing" a matrix   means writing it in the form  PDP^-1  where  P  is invertible and  D  is diagonal.
