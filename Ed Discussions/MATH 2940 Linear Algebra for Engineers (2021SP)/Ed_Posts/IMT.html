 Do you have to prove that A is invertible first before you can use any of the properties in the invertible matrix theorem? Or can you use any of those properties to prove that A is invertible as a consequence. For example, if A has cols that are linearly independent, can you say A is therefore invertible?

  I think if A is an nxn matrix and it follows at least one of the properties of the IMT, then it follows all of them since they all imply eachother in some way
