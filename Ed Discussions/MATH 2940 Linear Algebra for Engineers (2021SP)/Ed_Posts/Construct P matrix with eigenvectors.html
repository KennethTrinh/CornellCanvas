  When I construct my P matrix with my eigenvectors (letâ€™s say I have two eigenvectors, v1 for my smallest eigenvalue and v2 for my largest eigenvalue) is there a set order in which I should place them to construct my P matrix? That is, should P always be P=[v1 v2] or could I make P=[v2 v1] as well?

  You can order them however you wish, but the order of the eigenvalues in $D$ must be in the same order as their corresponding eigenvectors in $P$.
