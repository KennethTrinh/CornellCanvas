  I've read and tried to understand this question for quite a while now but am still quite confused
  <break>
  </break>
  I think I understand the idea behind images and linear transformations decently well but I can't quite grasp what we are supposed to do for this question :/

  Maybe you could try a specific example. You can analyze the plane spanned by $e_1=(1,0,0)$ and $e_2=(0,1,0)$ through the origin in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and apply the transformations given by the matrices

  and analyze the images. In particular, you should try to see where the vectors $e_1$ and $e_2$ are sent and how they relate to the dimension of the image.

  I hope this doesn't give away the answer, but use the properties of linear transformations given at the near top of page 67 to approach this question.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  In essence, take what the question gives you for P = su + tv, and put that in as x in T(x), then use properties of linear transformations to show that T(P) also produces a plane (more specifically a solution of the form, aq + br. where q and r are vectors.
