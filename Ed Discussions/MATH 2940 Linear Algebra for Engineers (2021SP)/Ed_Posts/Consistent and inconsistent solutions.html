 In an example like this, where x2 is a free variable, would we still classify x1 as being a free variable since it doesn't end up in the final equations?

  Did you mean to say that
  <strike>
   x2
  </strike>
  x3 is a free variable?

   I believe x2 here is basic, and x1 is free because the system is not dependent on its value.

   Consider free variables to be like variables that aren't explicitly defined, while basic variables can be written in terms of constants and/or other variables
