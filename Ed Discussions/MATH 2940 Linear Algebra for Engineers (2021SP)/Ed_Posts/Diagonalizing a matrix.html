  When you diagonalize a matrix does it matter what order you put the Eigenvectors in P or the eigenvalues in D as long as it is consistent? In question 4C on the sample prelim 2 I have the eigenvectors and values, but my order is flipped. and if order matter, how do I determine it

  The order doesn't matter as long as the eigenvalues are in matching order with their corresponding eigenvectors. The $P^{-1}$ term in $PDP^{-1}$ cancels out your chosen order so that you get the same product.

  Thank you! Also, does it matter if we leave the eigenvectors in fraction form?

  Nope, eigenvectors are unique up to a constant, and the constant also gets canceled out by the $P^{-1}$.
