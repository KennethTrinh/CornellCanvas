  I don't understand how this question was done. I thought to get the eigenvectors, I had to plug in the eigenvalues back into (A- Î»I)x=0 since we had 3 eigenvalues, making them equal n. How did we get the null space of A from this process?

  From part (a), we get that there are two eigenvalues 2 and 0, with the value 0 having a multiplicity of 2. This means for A to have a basis of eigenvectors, the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue of 0 must have a dimension of 2. You're correct in that we plug the eigenvalue into $$(A-\lambda I)x=0$$ to solve for the nullspace of A, which we get is spanned by a single vector, which means that A does not have sufficient eigenvectors to form an eigenbasis.
