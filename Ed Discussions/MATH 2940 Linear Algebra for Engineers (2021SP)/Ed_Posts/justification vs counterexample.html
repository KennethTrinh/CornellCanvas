<p>
 for 6b, would it be correct if i justified my answer by saying "x is never expressed explicitly as the product of invertible matrices or as an invertible matrix itself so it cannot be invertible." is it okay to justify your answer without providing a counter example if thats not explicitly stated in the question?

  No, your reason is insufficient, as you did not justify why $C-B$ isn't necessarily invertible.
