 I have read through the textbook and reviewed my lecture notes, but I am a little bit confused on what
</p>
<math>
 \left[\vec{b_{n\ }}\right]_C
</math>
<p>
 is supposed to represent. What does it mean for it to be the "C-coordinate vectors of the vectors in the basis B"? What does this mean geometrically?

  The entries in the coordinate vector are the weights you need in a linear combination of the vectors in  C  to get the vector  b_n.
