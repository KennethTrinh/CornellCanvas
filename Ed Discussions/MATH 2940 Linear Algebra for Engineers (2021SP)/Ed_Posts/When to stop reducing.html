 This is an example in the book on page 18. I am confused why they stop early when reducing the matrix. Can we not also cancel out the 3 in the top row, 4th column in the last matrix using the 2nd row?

  If they did that, the 1st row 3rd column position would no longer be 0 and the matrix would not be in reduced echelon form (in reduced echelon form, all leading entries are 1 and leading entries are the only nonzero entries in their columns).
