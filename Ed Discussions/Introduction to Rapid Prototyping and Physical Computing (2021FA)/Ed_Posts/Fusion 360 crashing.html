  The motion study is causing my Fusion 360 to crash. How can I create the animation without Fusion crashing every time?

  I don't know if this will help in your specific circumstance, but you could try motion link instead (it works by defining a relationship between two joints). I use it instead of contact sets sometimes since it is much less computationally expensive.
