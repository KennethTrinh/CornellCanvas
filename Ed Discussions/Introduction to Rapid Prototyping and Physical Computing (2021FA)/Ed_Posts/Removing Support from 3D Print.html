  We created and 3D printed an auger screw for our project, and chose support to be 'everywhere' in PrusaSlicer so that it wouldn't fail. Now that it has printed, we are unsure how to get the support out. We tried using pliers and picking it out ourselves, but it does not seem that effective.

  This is what it looks like after printing. We are trying to get it to a coil shaped structure.

  Using small plyers is one approach being sure to remove a small amount at a time. Please be sure to wear the safety glasses provided in your kit.
