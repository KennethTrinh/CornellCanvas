  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I tried using the laser cutter today. But every time after I set my xy plotter and start the job, it will go to the very right bottom corner and the screen will say “xy disable”. I did the same thing yesterday and it all worked. I’m not sure why it is not printing correctly. Thank you!

  It seems like a problem with scaling. This is the kind of error you are getting when a drawing is out of range.
