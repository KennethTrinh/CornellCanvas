  Hi, I was wondering how much description is necessary for the automaton project-- I have the design, a video of it animated all together, and lots of screenshots at different angles, but I was unsure how much detail I should go into when describing how I designed it? It took a long time and has many steps, so I wasn't sure if it was necessary to go into the grain of detail of "I made this sketch, then extruded it, and filleted it on this side, then made a joint interaction to interlock it with another gear" etc, or if I should just explain how all the parts fit together?

  The description does not have to be very long. Its purpose is to explain the goal of the design.
