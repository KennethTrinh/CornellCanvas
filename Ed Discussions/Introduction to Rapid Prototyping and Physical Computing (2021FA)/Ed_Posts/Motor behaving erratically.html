 Hi there, i'm having some trouble with my motor functionality.
</p>
<pre>const int step_pin = 13;
const int direction_pin = 12;
// 200 steps for 360 degree
const int STEPS_PER_TURN = 200;
// Adjust the delay for control speed
const int delay_between_step_microsec = 5000;
int curr_steps = 0;
bool fwd = true;

void setup()
{
  Serial.begin(9600);
  pinMode(step_pin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(direction_pin, OUTPUT);
}

void step(bool forward)
{
  // setting the direction
  if (forward == true)
  {
    digitalWrite(direction_pin, HIGH);
  }
  else
  {
    digitalWrite(direction_pin, LOW);
  }
  // creating a step
  digitalWrite(step_pin, HIGH);
  delayMicroseconds(4);// minimum 1.9us
  digitalWrite(step_pin, LOW);
}

void steps(int number_of_steps)
{
  bool move_forward = true;
  // Establishing the direction
  if (number_of_steps &gt;= 0)
  {
    move_forward = true;
  }
  else
  {
    move_forward = false;
    number_of_steps = -number_of_steps;
  }
  // Generating the steps
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; number_of_steps; i++)
  {
    step(move_forward);
    // Delay for proper speed
    delayMicroseconds(delay_between_step_microsec);
  }
}

void loop()
{
  //your code here
  if (fwd &amp;&amp; curr_steps &lt;= 100) {
    curr_steps++;
    steps(1);
    if (curr_steps == 100) {
      fwd = false;
    }
  } else if (!fwd &amp;&amp; curr_steps &gt;= 0) {
    curr_steps--;
    steps(-1);
    if (curr_steps == 0) {
      fwd = true;
    }
  }

  int reading = analogRead(12);
  int mapped = map(reading, 0, 4095, 0, 3300);
  float volts = (float) mapped / 1000.0;
  float dist = 10 * 70.0/volts - 6;
  float angle = curr_steps * 1.8 * 10;
  Serial.print(String(angle, 0) + "," + String(dist, 0) + ".");

  while (!Serial.available());
  Serial.read();
} 

</pre>
<p>
 My code makes the stepper motor turn at 180 degree angles normally as expected UNTIL I add the last 8 lines of code (
 <code>
  int reading = analogRad(12); ... Serial.read()
 </code>
 ). At this point, my motor suddenly moves in a very jerky fashion. After trying to see exactly what makes my code behave like this, i think it might be the Serial.print calls, but I'm not completely sure why this is happening.
</p>
<p>
 Could you explain what causes this behavior? I remember discussing something about how overloading Serial.prints can cause erratic behavior, but I thought the last 2 lines (basically waiting for something to be available with the while loop and then flushing the buffer with
 <code>
  read
 </code>
 would help control overloading.
</p>
<p>
 All help is much appreciated!

  Hello,
  <break>
  </break>
  You are running into this problem because you are using pin #12 both for an output (Direction) and an Analog input. Each pin can be used for only one function at a time. Simply moving the range sensor input to an other pin should address your problem.
