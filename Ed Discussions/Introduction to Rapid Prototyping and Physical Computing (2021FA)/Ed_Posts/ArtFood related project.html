  Hello! I'm Anya and I'm currently looking for a group:) A few ideas I had are:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1) Pancake printer (uses different colors of batter/make pancake art)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2) Sand table display (a metal ball moves on a platform with a thin layer of sand)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  3) Motion chaser (traces arms and legs and associate that to drawing/music tunes)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I'm also down to discuss any other project ideas. Email me at
  <link href="mailto:aj592@cornell.edu"/>
  aj592@cornell.edu if you are interested! Thanks!
