 Hi, I'm trying to 3D print to printer 5, and it has some kind of strange Z calibration error its continually trying to fix then gets stuck on. Any advice on how to debug this?

  Please check that the printing plate (yellowish metal plate) is clear and had no plastic stuck to it on both sides. Please also make sure that the print bed (the black part) is also clean.
