  There is a laser cutter in the Rapid Prototyping Lab in the basement of Upson. Email them (cornellrpl@gmail.com) a DXF of the sketch you want to cut out. Go during open hours (see the schedule at
  <link href="https://cornellrpl.wixsite.com/cornellrpl"/>
  https://cornellrpl.wixsite.com/cornellrpl) and bring your material. You will be moved to the top of the queue and the lab technicians will cut it out for your immediately. Hope this helps!
