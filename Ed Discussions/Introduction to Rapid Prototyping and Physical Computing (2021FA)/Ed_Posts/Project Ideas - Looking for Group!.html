  Hey everyone, I’m Bryce, a senior IS major needing this class for IT concentration. In terms of project ideas, I don’t want to dominate the discussion but I’m interested in these general themes/ideas:
 </paragraph>
 <list style="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    Food (custom pancakes, drink/smoothie/milkshake maker etc.)
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    Music (Piano player that can read/play sheet music)
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    Cards (card sorter, shuffler, dealer, magician etc.)
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
 </list>
 <paragraph>
  <break>
  </break>
  If you’re also high priority for enrollment and either need another group member or want to start a group up and talk ideas, reach out or comment below. I’ll also be in discussion tomorrow wearing an orange and black SF Giants baseball hat so feel free to sit with me if you’re looking for a group!
