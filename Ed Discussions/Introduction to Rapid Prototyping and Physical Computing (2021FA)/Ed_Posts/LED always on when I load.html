  My led is turned on as default when I upload my arduino script. When I looked. this up online it says that this is random. Is this okay  or should I fix it? https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/63744/led-on-breadboard-lights-up-on-boot

  By default, the ESP32 pin cannot drive a pin, so there might be something else going on. Could you send me the code you are using as well as a picture of your circuit? Thanks.

  I think I solved the issue seems that I connected my LED backwards. Thank you! :)
