 Is there a difference between these two functions? When I use Serial.write() I often get a lot of strange characters (?s and boxes), but Serial.print() doesn't do this. Even when casting to a String Serial.write() acts differently than Serial.print(). What's the difference? I assumed Serial.write() was used for Serial.read() (ie it would write to the serial port, which the read() function could detect), but is that the only difference?

  Hi Ava,
 </p>
 <p>
  While Serial.write() sends binary data, Serial.print() sends ASCII formatted text. I found useful explanations of the difference between them in

   can you still read the output of print using Serial.read()? When i try to do that, it seems that the system can't read the output when I try using print.

    I'm not sure if I understand your question. Serial.read() does not read what you send using Serial.print() but waits for serial inputs from another end through serial communication (e.g., serial monitor, the processing program)
