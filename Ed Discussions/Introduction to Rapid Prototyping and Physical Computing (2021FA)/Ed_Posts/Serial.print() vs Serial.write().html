  Is there a difference between these two functions? When I use Serial.write() I often get a lot of strange characters (?s and boxes), but Serial.print() doesn't do this. Even when casting to a String Serial.write() acts differently than Serial.print(). What's the difference? I assumed Serial.write() was used for Serial.read() (ie it would write to the serial port, which the read() function could detect), but is that the only difference?

  Hi Ava,

  While Serial.write() sends binary data, Serial.print() sends ASCII formatted text. I found useful explanations of the difference between them in
  <link href="https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/10088/what-is-the-difference-between-serial-write-and-serial-print-and-when-are-they"/>
  this thread.

  can you still read the output of print using Serial.read()? When i try to do that, it seems that the system can't read the output when I try using print.

  I'm not sure if I understand your question. Serial.read() does not read what you send using Serial.print() but waits for serial inputs from another end through serial communication (e.g., serial monitor, the processing program)
