 Hi everyone! I'm a CS M.Eng interested in robotics. The project idea I have in mind is to work on a robotic arm capable of mimicking the location of a hand held sensor (The sensor could be attached to a pen for instance and would be held by the user, another pen could be attached to the end of the robotic arm allowing the robotic arm to mimic the users writing). That being said, I'm open to hear about any robotics related ideas you might have!
