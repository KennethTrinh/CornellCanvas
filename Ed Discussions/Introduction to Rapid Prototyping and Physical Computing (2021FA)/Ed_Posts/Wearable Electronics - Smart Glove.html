 Hi everyone!
</p>
<p>
 I'm Robby, and Kathleen Wang(kw456) and I (both seniors in ECE) are looking for one more person to join our team to build a smart glove. This would be a glove with mouse/trackpad functionality (that allows the user to operate their computer using gestures and finger movements in midair). We're thinking it could be a cool way to operate computers without relying on a flat surface.
</p>

 If you are interested in this idea or have suggestions to build on it, feel free to email me at lh479@cornell.edu or simply comment below.
