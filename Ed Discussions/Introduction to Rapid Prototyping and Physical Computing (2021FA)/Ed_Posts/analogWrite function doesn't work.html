 I'm trying to use analogWrite to control the speed of the motor. The following is my code for the motor to go forward:
</p>
<pre>  analogWrite(motorEnablePin,0);
  digitalWrite(leftSidePin, HIGH);
  digitalWrite(rightSidePin, LOW);
  analogWrite(motorEnablePin, 255);</pre>
<p>
 This doesn't work. But when I changed the two analogWrite functions to digitalWrite(motorEnablePin, LOW/HIGH), it now works. I can't figure out what might cause this.
</p>

  This is my code:
 </p>
 <pre>#include &lt;analogWrite.h&gt;
// Motor control
const int motorEnablePin = 15;
const int leftSidePin = 32;
const int rightSidePin = 14;

const int encoderPin = 33;

void setup()
{
  // configure the motor pins
  pinMode(motorEnablePin,OUTPUT);
  pinMode(leftSidePin,OUTPUT);
  pinMode(rightSidePin,OUTPUT);
  // Motor is off going forward
  analogWrite(motorEnablePin,0);
  digitalWrite(leftSidePin, HIGH);
  digitalWrite(rightSidePin, LOW);
  analogWrite(motorEnablePin, 255);
}

void loop(){
{

</pre>
 <p>
  The circuit is the same as the one we saw during the class.

   Was the circuit working with analogWrite in class?
  </p>
  <p>
   It will be best for us to see the full code and the circuit you are using

   We will be happy to help, but we need more context, such as the full code as well as the circuit you are using.
