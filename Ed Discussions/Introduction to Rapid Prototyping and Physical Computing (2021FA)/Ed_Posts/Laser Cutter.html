 Hello,
 <break>
 </break>
 During the class today I discovered that the laser cutter is no longer working. More specifically the Y axis motor seems to not respond anymore. I will be looking into the problem tomorrow morning, but in the meantime, it will be great if I could received (anonymously as needed) more information on the possible cause of the problem.

 If you were expecting to use the laser cutter for your project, you have several options:
</p>
<list style="bullet">
 <li>
  <p>
   See if you can 3D print the part instead (mostly for small part);
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Check if one of your group member has access to other campus resources such as the Rapid Prototyping Lab, the school of Architecture or the shop in the Fiber building;
  </p>
 </li>

   Contact us so that we can find the best way forward for you;
