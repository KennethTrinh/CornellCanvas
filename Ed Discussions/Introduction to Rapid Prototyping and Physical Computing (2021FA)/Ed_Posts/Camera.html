  Hi! Prof. Francois gave us feedback after Step 1 that it would be feasible to track single color cups using OpenCV. If we wanted to proceed with this idea, would we then need to include a camera in our parts list for Step 2? If so, what should we be looking for in a camera?

  Yes, you should put a reasonable camera on your list and we will see if we have one in the lab. The camera can be connected directly to a computer running OpenCV. Connecting the camera to ESP32 is also possible but image capture will be slow.
