 Hi everyone,
</p>
<p>
 I'm thinking about creating a game board that alters its structure every game using procedural generation--it would use raiseable, backlit (w/ multiple colors) tiles to represent different types of spaces on the board. I haven't decided on a concrete design for the game itself, but there are loads of directions this could go in including player vs board and player vs player type games.

 If this sounds interesting to you, contact me at tqy2@cornell.edu. Thanks!
