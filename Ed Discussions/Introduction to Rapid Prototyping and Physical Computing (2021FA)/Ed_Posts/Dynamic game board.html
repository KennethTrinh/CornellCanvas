  Hi everyone,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I'm thinking about creating a game board that alters its structure every game using procedural generation--it would use raiseable, backlit (w/ multiple colors) tiles to represent different types of spaces on the board. I haven't decided on a concrete design for the game itself, but there are loads of directions this could go in including player vs board and player vs player type games.
