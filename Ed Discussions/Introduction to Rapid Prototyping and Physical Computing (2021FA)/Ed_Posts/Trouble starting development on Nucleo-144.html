  I tried looking up a guide and came across an
  <link href="https://www.instructables.com/Quick-Start-to-STM-Nucleo-on-Arduino-IDE/"/>
  Instructables post.

  The "Additional Boards Manager URLs" link was outdated and eventually prompted me to use this latest link:
  <link href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stm32duino/BoardManagerFiles/main/package_stmicroelectronics_index.json"/>

  I selected the Nucleo-144 board and tried to upload the Blink code. However, that resulted in an error due to an incorrect board part number. I couldn't fix this issue because our board part number "H723ZG" is not in the dropdown list.

  Does anyone know what I should do? Is there a better tutorial out there?
