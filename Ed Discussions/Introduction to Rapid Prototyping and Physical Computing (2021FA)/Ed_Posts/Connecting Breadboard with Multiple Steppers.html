  For our project, we are trying to connect multiple stepper motors to simultaneously run our auger screws. We tried connecting a second breadboard with a second stepper motor to our one already working stepper motor. We connected ground and power between both breadboards as well. The second stepper motor on the other breadboard (bottom) does not seem to be working, however. Is there anything we are doing wrong while connecting these breadboards?

  We have many spare breadboards available in the lab, they could help simplify the wiring.

  Could you give me more information about what is not working:

 <list style="bullet">
  <list-item>

    Did you check the power distribution?

    Did you check the signals to both stepper controllers?

    Do you know if they are working independently but not together? Is the LED on the power supply blinking?
