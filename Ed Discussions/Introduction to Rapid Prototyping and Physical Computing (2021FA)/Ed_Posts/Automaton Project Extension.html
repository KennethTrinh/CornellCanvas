 I was wondering if we could have an extension on the model for the Automaton Project, or a part of it could be made optional like last year? I don't think that there has been enough time to fully come up with an idea and model the Automaton while also juggling the final presentation and poster due just a few days later. There has not been time to work on either before this week because of the Jack-in-the-box project and break, and trying to fully complete both this week has been difficult. I know no one on my team have been able to even start the design assignment yet, and I know a lot of people in the lab right now that have also not been able to start yet due to how much there still is to do for the final project. Thank you for your consideration, we’d really appreciate an extension!

  I’d really appreciate an extension too. It’s been a lot of projects and I want to be able to focus fully on each one.
