  Hi everyone! Ansh Godha (ag759), Connor Pugh (cwp57), and I are looking for a fourth teammate if anyone does not have a group by now. We are looking to build a coffee machine, where the user can add different essences (chocolate, coconut, spices, etc) that will be mixed into the coffee grounds to make unique customizable flavors. Using these flavored coffee grounds, the machine will then operate similar to a Keurig machine, and produce a final cup of coffee ready for consumption.
