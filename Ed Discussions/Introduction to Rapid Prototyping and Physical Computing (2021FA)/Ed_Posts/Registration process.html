 Hello,
 <break>
 </break>
 I have received many questions about the registration process for this course. As in the past, students will be registered at once after having settled on a group, a project topic, and a weekly meeting time with one of our TAs. This process should take place in the second week of the semester.
</p>
<p>
 We can accommodate 40 students in the Fall, and I give priority to students:
</p>
<list style="number">
 <li>
  <p>
   who need the class to graduate this semester;
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   for whom this is the last time they can take the class;
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   two applied in the past but did not get in;
  </p>
 </li>
</list>
<p>
 To simplify the management of this information, please complete
 <a href="https://forms.gle/GNpj8VDTQnV4R9U56">
  this form
 </a>
 as soon as possible.
</p>
<p>
 In the meantime, you should attend a class and monitors Ed and Canvas for announcements.
</p>
<p>
 Looking forward to seeing you all on Monday the 30th of August.

<p>
 Francois.
