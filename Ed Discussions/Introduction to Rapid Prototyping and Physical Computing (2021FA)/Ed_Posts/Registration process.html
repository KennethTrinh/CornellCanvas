  Hello,
  <break>
  </break>
  I have received many questions about the registration process for this course. As in the past, students will be registered at once after having settled on a group, a project topic, and a weekly meeting time with one of our TAs. This process should take place in the second week of the semester.

 <paragraph>
  We can accommodate 40 students in the Fall, and I give priority to students:

    who need the class to graduate this semester;
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    for whom this is the last time they can take the class;
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    two applied in the past but did not get in;

  this form as soon as possible.

  In the meantime, you should attend a class and monitors Ed and Canvas for announcements.

  Looking forward to seeing you all on Monday the 30th of August.
