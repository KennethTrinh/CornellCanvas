  If you look at the Processing .pde file, the program sends a 'new character' (N) once it's ready to add a new point to the canvas. Waiting to see if the Serial buffer has something available to read and then flushing it (using Serial.available() + Serial.read()) before looping again should give you what you're looking for.

  The processing program sends a character 'N' to esp32 as a request to receive new information. So in your arduino code, you need to wait for a character from the processing until you move to the next step and send new information.

  Practically, it means that you have to have something like
  <code>
   while(Serial.available()==0); Serial.read();
  </code>
  inside the loop function.
