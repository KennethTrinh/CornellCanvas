  Are electronics and software considered their own functional blocks, or are they considered part of the hardware block that they control? For instance, if one of our blocks is a valve system, would the electronics and software needed to control the valves be combined in that block, or would it (and the other electronics/software in the system) be considered a separate block?

  I will consider them as different blocks for this class. In practice you will have the following units:
 </paragraph>
 <list style="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    Hardware components;
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    Electronic controls for the hardware components are often aggregated on one circuit board (or breadboard)
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    The MCU/Software running on the show
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
 </list>
 <paragraph>
  This will reflect how you are going to build the final system.
