 Hi there! Is it possible to set up access and 3D print  times for lab to minimize the number of people in the lab at different times to avoid crowding? The lab gets very crowded at times and with people just starting with the automaton 3D prints I imagine itâ€™ll only get worse.
</p>

  Thank you for the great suggestion, I just created the access sheet and will work toward distributing the printer in the lab.
