  Hi! Almost all the pliers that were previously kept in the middle shelf on the right are now missing. We need the pliers for our project, does anyone know where they are?

  There are some pliers in the blue toolbox, but I would like to second the message that tools need to come back to the lab in a timely manner. Thanks.

  Last I checked, there was only one plier there which was not effective. I remember there being multiple small pliers in the past, which have now disappeared in the past few days.
