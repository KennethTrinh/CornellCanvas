 The laser cutting machine doesn't work for some reason. I followed every step and pressed the "Go" button, and then the device didn't do anything, suddenly showing "Done" on the screen.

  Itâ€™s most likely that the stroke weight or color is not set correctly. the stroke weight should be exactly 0.001 inch.

   Oh, we need to click the "combine" button. Now it works, thank you.
