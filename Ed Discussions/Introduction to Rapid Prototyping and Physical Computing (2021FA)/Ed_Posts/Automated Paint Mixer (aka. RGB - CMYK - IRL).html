 Hi all!

<p>
 I'm Kevin, a senior in CS who likes to dabble in design and the arts. Since one of the listed project ideas is to build "an automatic bartender", I thought that we could extend the idea a bit, and build a Kickstarter-esque paint mixer that would blend several tubes of base color into any color under the sun, coffee maker style. I've got some light Arduino and ESP32 experience, and a few years of mobile and web development experience to apply to this project. If you find this idea interesting, please hit me up at
