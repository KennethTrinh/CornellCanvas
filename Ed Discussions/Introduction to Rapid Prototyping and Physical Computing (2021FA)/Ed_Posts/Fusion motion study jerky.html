  Hello, I've been trying to use the motion study for my automaton but it's not smooth like our example in class. I resized my cams and it's been a bit better, but I'm unsure why it's still not turning smoothly even when I turn the speed all the way down. When it reaches a certain angle, the animation stops and doesn't begin again until a later angle.

  In that case, I will do two things:
 </paragraph>
 <list style="number">
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    Reduce the speed of the animation so that your computer can keep up;
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    Use contact sets (instead of all contacts) again to limit the compute load;
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
 </list>
