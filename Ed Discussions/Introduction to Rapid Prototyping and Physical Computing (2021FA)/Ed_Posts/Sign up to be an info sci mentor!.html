 Hello! The Information Science Student’s Association mentorship program is kicking off soon for this semester! We are looking to build a community of dedicated mentors excited about providing guidance to and building relationships with underclassmen in Information Science. As an ISSA mentor, you will be assigned a small family of students in your concentration with similar career interests. You will also be a CIS department point of contact for students interested in the major to ask any questions they might have. Please fill out this super quick form if you’re interested (takes 30 seconds):
