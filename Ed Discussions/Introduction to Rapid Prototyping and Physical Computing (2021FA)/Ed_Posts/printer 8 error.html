 Printer 8 in the lab doesn't seem to work properly. I tried and it errored out saying something like overadjusted platform...

  Could you provide a picture of the error message? From your description, it seems that the printing plate is not flat. Maybe there is glue below it or on the black support, it is resting on.

   Ah it was possible. I didn't end up using it, but I think there was some glue on it. Thank you!
