 Hello,
 <break>
 </break>
 I hope that this email will find you well!
</p>
<p>
 We just completed the class enrollment. If you received a PIN you should be sure to register for the course before class tomorrow as we will only distribute kits to people enrolled in the class. You should also be sure to bring a regular USB adaptor to class tomorrow (if your computer requires it).

 If you did not receive a PIN, you are still on the waiting list, but it is unlikely you will be able to attend the class this semester. The good news is that we are offering the class every semester and you will then have priority.
</p>
<p>
 Do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.
</p>
<p>
 Francois.
