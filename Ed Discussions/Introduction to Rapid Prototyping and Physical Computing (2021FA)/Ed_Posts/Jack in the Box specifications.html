  Hi, I was wondering if there's an item meant to come out of the box for the jack in the box? Is it acceptable to have an item inside but not pop out, but rather have the lid open when a button is pressed to reveal an object inside? I feel a bit confused about what the Jack-in-the-box entails at a minimum.

  The name "Jack in the Box" might be a little misleading. Rather, think of it as an interactive "fun" box. You don't have to have anything pop out, or even a lid. This project is a measure of how well you can integrate actuators with laser-cut components while keeping all of it in an appealing enclosure.

  Here are a two examples of excellent boxes from last semester:

  Keep in mind that you aren't limited to the MakerCase boxes that require screws. You can also use finger joints. We suggest using the former as we have the screws and nuts to put the walls together, and you can also take it apart if you need to fix something inside.

  Hope this helps!

  Thanks for the detailed response -- but why wasn't this in the project description weeks ago? I've been operating under the assumption that this project needs to be a jack-in-the-box, as the title describes -- a box with an opening lid and something that comes out.

  The assignment is to build a jack in the box, but as it was stated in class several times, and as Felix points out we will be very flexible on the interpretation focusing on creativity over the strict definition of a jack in the box.
