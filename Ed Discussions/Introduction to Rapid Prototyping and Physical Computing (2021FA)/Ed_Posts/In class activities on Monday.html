 Hello,
 <break>
 </break>
 I am planning a couple of in-class activities this coming Monday and they will require the following items from each of you (there is no need to buy anything):
</p>
<list style="bullet">
 <li>
  <p>
   A pair of scissors;
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   A name tag of your own design;
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   any color markers/crayons/pastels you might have;
   <break>
   </break>
  </p>
 </li>
</list>
<p>
 Have a great weekend and I will see you on Monday.
</p>
<p>
 Francois.
