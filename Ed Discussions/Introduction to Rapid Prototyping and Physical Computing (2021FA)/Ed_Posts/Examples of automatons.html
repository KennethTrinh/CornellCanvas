  Hi, would it be possible to see a few examples of previous automatons to get a sense for the complexity and size expected? Also are we allowed to use a small amount of non-3D printed parts? Such as pins to hold together joints

  I did present two prototypes in class last Monday and I can bring them back. Small pins to lock things in place will be acceptable but they will not count toward the minimum solid count.
