 Hello,

 I wanted to remind everyone about our unusual schedule next week:
</p>
<list style="bullet">
 <li>
  <p>
   Only the demo part of Project #3 is due on Monday;
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   The report (including videos) of Project #3 is due on Wed at the end of the day;
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Because of Thanksgiving, the reading on our next topic (I2C and SPI) is due on Wed Nov 17;
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   I will start presenting I2C on Wed to be sure we have ample time to finish our work on Mond Nov 22;
   <break>
   </break>
  </p>
 </li>
</list>
<p>
 Do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.
