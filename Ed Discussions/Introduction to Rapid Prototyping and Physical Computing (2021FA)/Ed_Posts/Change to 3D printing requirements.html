  Hello,
  <break>
  </break>
  As I am sure you know our county is experiencing a fast rise in COVID cases. Being mindful of the safety of all the students in the class, and the possible risks caused by overcrowding in 114, we decided to change the final requirement for the 3D printing project as follow:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For the video demonstrating your model in action, you can either:
 </paragraph>
 <list style="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    Submit a video of your 3D printed model in action;
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    Submit a video of an animation of your model in action;
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
 </list>
 <paragraph>
  Both options will be graded the same way.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Be safe.

  My submission includes videos of both an animation and the live 3D print. However, the live 3D print did not come out perfectly so the animation looks much better. Should I resubmit and remove the video of the actual print or leave the submission with both videos? Thank you.
