 When it comes to solving questions 1b on this week's homework, it is apparent that the posted code is close to what you need, but you have to make some changes to get it to work.
</p>
<p>
 But here's the deal, you can try to use the code to look at the Earth Moon solution to make sure you understand what is going on, but you should find a DIFFERENT example for your actual submission.  I don't want to see any Earth-Moon examples in the final submissions.
</p>
<p>
 Also, you should plot your trajectory in the frame centered on the CoM of the system, so that it looks like the diagram in the question.
