  I have found a small correction to the Lecture 20 notes. There is a missing negative on page 3.  The cross product of the basis vectors should be;
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  \hat{e}_r\times\hat{i} = -\hat{k}sin(\theta)
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  This makes sense given the right hand rule and order of operations in the diagram, the resultant would point into the page whereas positive k is out.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  This negative symbol carries through the rest of the problem without too much fuss, and lands in the final result as shown below.  (This correction has also been made in the Canvas copy).
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  In simulations of this particular problem you might not notice the error, as the constant h_r could be negative.  However, it is important because the result should match the example in Lecture 22, where we will need to take the dot product of two basis vectors and get a similar result;
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  \hat{e}_{\theta}\ \bullet\ \hat{i}=-\sin(\theta)
 </math>
