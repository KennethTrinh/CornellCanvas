 A periodic motion means that your
 <b>
  state (position and velocity)
 </b>
 at time 0 (or t for any t) equals to the state at time period T (or t+T).
</p>
<p>
 NOT the
 <b>
  time derivative of state
 </b>
 (velocity and acceleration)
</p>
<p>
 If you have velocity at 0 = velocity at T AND acceleration at 0 = accel at T
</p>
<p>
 no guarantee that the position at 0 equals to position at T.
</p>
<p>
 ------------------------
</p>
<p>
 A counter example to illustrate: let's say a central force of ~(-r^3)
</p>
<p>
 at time 0, r,theta=10, 0. with some velocity e.g. (1,2)
</p>
<p>
 at time "period" T, your r, theta=10, 1, with the same velocity e.g. (1,2)
</p>
<p>
 at these two time because the r is the same, the force (at 0 &amp;T) are equal, and the acceleraion are equal. HOWEVER, this T is not your period, because your position (r, theta) at 0 and T are different. It also does NOT necessarily show that your motion is periodical.
</p>
<p>
 So, saying that the state derivative at 0 equals to state derivative at T does NOT guarantee the motion is periodic. (by the argument or also the counter example).
</p>
<p>
 On the contrary, having your state at 0 equals to state at T GUARANTEES that the state derivative at 0 equals to the state derivative at T. BECAUSE your state derivative just depends on the state, so if the states are equal then the state derivative will equal as well.
</p>
<p>
 So the direction is one way, not two ways (if and only if)
</p>

 If you want to use the derivative of state (Xdot), then you need to make sure that
</p>
<p>
 Xdot at t = Xdot at t+T FOR ALL t from 0 to T
</p>
<p>
 NOT JUST
</p>
<p>
 Xdot at 0 = Xdot at T
</p>
