 Some of you might have noticed the autograder question go down for a few moments there.  I have reuploaded and I think I corrected the error in the verification tool.

 If there is anyone working on this, can you try resubmitting your code now and tell me if it's working?

 For those who missed the lecture, I will extend the deadline on this upload to Monday.  I think at this point it is mostly troubleshooting how to craft the questions in this system.
