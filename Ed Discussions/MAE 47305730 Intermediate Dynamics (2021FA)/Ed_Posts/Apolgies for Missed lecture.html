 My sincere apologies to anyone who came to class this morning who didn't get my announcement.  I hit a deer on my way to work in an area with not great reception, so I had trouble posting announcements.  I will record the lecture later today.
</p>
<p>
 I have posted Prelim 2 past exams, with solutions coming available Sunday morning.
</p>
<p>
 Homework will be posted soon.  It will due Monday, only 2 questions.
