 I have uploaded a couple of resource pages I'd like to draw your attention to, a document on
 <a href="https://canvas.cornell.edu/courses/33848/files/4361850?module_item_id=1178482">
  homework guidelines
  , and my presentation on
  <link href="https://canvas.cornell.edu/courses/33848/files/4361913?module_item_id=1178488"/>
  writing a PhD thesis, which has tons of info on creating effective LaTeX documentation, but also some good notes for Matlab and Inkscape.

</p>
<p>
 The most important points that I want to bring to your attention;
</p>
<list style="bullet">
 <li>
  <p>
   Write the solution that you wish someone had given you to help you understand the result (this guidance works for any report you write).
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   This means, equations should be derived using FBDs, and
   <b>
    plots should be well labelled
   </b>
   and clear. Think about clarity of font, overlapping colors, legends etc.
  </p>
 </li>
</list>
<p>
 Creating easy to read graphs and figures is a skill in itself, and worth putting the effort in now to learn.  Your legend in matlab has a lot of flexibility that you might not immediately see.
