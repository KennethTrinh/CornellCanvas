  There was a very small inconsistency between the canvas homework pdf and the gradescope one, which has been corrected.

  The pdf on Canvas originally said that part of the homework would be uploaded to Matlab grader, but now everything (apart from the animation) is to be uploaded on gradescope this week.  The pdf's now both reflect this.  Sorry for any confusion!
