 I have made a one question survey in canvas to get some feedback about the best mask to wear in class.  The survey is anonymous, and you can select cloth, clear or face shield.   I haven't tried the faceshield yet but if that is a popular choice I can get one.

 The survey will be open until Tuesday, find it here
