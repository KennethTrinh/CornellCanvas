  Hi all. It's been 5 homeworks so far. I'd really appreciate if you can do the following when submitting HW:
 </paragraph>
 <list style="bullet">

   <paragraph>
    Assign the corresponding pages of the problem part on the gradescope. Please, I beg you (i have been leaving comments to do so since many homeworks ago).
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>

    Write the homeworks nicely. Show the step by step solution.
