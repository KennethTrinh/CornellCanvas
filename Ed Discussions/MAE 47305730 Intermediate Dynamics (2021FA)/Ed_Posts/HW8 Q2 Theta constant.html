 When converting from X_A to X_G, for instance, there is a theta term and when differentiating to find X_G_dot this leads to a theta_dot term, unless theta is not a function of time. The problem setup implies the nonholonomic constraint function is not supposed to be a function of theta_dot. This confuses me.
