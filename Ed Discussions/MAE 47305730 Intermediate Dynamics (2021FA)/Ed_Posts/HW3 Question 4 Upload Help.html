  We found that one of the issues with uploading the solution was that I had used 'options' with ode45, and it was enough to make a difference to the first and third test cases.  Try adding these options to your rhs equation;
 </paragraph>
 <pre>options = odeset('absTol',1e-9,'relTol',1e-9);
  [t,Z] = ode45(@(t,Z) RHS(Z,p), tspan, Z0, options);</pre>
