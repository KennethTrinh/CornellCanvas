 When I am doing the HW4, I find that the "options" used in ode45 can help to make the trajectory more like the periodic motion. When I add "options" as below
</p>
<pre>options = odeset('absTol',1e-9,'relTol',1e-9);
[t,z] = ode45(fdynamic,t,z0,options);
</pre>
<p>
 My trajectory changes from the first figure to the second figure.  I have a question about how to decide the value of "options". I find that sometimes the value is 1e-5 and sometimes it is 1e-9. I don't know how to choose the value of that. Are there any criteria that can help to decide that?

  It is entirely context dependent.  As you can see, finding something that produces mathematically pure periodic motion will require a high degree of accuracy.  If you were trying to predict the flight of a ball, then your engineering judgement can be used to see how accurate the landing spot needs to be.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you want to be more rigorous, you can also do a fidelity check, where you trial different levels of accuracy and record the progression towards the solution.  Such a check is often done in CFD simulations, where the granularity of the mesh needs to be resolved such that the solution is sufficiently accurate without requiring excessive computation time.
