  Has anyone been able to simulate the four bar linkage successfully using Euler Lagrange? I've been trying to do this, but I have not been able to find lambda or the generalized reaction force using MatLab. Does anyone know how to solve for these symbolically? I know in theory how to do it on paper, just not using MatLab.
