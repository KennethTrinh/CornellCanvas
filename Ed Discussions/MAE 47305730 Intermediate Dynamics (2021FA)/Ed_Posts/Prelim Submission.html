 I'm a bit confused about the submission procedure.
</p>
<p>
 Do we click submit on the canvas prelim link after we have submitted on gradescope or before starting to solve the questions?
</p>
<p>
 Thanks in advance!

  Woops, sorry I missed this.  You can hit submit at any time, even now.  I just want you to register the start time from canvas, but in order to see the start time you need to "submit" which registers both the start and end.  I get the end time from Gradescope though, so don't worry if your Canvas end time is way out of sync with your actual submission.
