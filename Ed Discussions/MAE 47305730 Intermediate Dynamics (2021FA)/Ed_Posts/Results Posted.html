  The results of HW1 have been posted, but we are still following up a few points so there are a few people who got less than 10 who should expect to see that come back up.

 <paragraph>
  If you do want to question a result on Gradescope, can you please post the request via the options in gradescope so that Josephine and I can both see the enquiry.  That way you are sure to get a faster response.
