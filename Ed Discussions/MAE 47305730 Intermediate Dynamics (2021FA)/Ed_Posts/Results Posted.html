 The results of HW1 have been posted, but we are still following up a few points so there are a few people who got less than 10 who should expect to see that come back up.
</p>
<p>
 If you do want to question a result on Gradescope, can you please post the request via the options in gradescope so that Josephine and I can both see the enquiry.  That way you are sure to get a faster response.

  I'm not sure if people are familiar with gradescope or not.
 </p>
 <p>
  But, all descriptions on the right column of gradescope is the rubrics.
 </p>
 <p>
  If I don't click it, it means it does not apply to you.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just because a "-1 missing one question" is listed there, it does not mean it applies to you (unless I click it).
 </p>
 <p>
  You can count your total number of points by summing the things that are applied to you.

  Additionally, I gave some comments (to some) as well, whether annotated on the work or typed comments down there.
