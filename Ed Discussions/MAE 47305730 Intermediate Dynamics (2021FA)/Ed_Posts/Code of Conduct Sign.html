  Hi!
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Can we put a digital signature on the code of conduct agreement rather than taking a printout for a manual signing process?

  follow up question--I signed the first page of my prelim (but used my own paper and did not print out the cover page of the exam), do I need to also sign a print-out of the code of conduct page?

  If you can I'd appreciate it. I will try to bring some hard copies to class tomorrow, and you can sign there as well if it's that's easier than printing it yourself.
