 Could somebody help me find the jacobian in the last part of Q3?
</p>
<p>
 A general approached shared would be appreciated.

  I will go over this on Wednesday this week too.

   So for a general system the Jacobian is defined as:
  </p>
  <math>
   J_{ij} = \frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x_j}
  </math>
  <p>
   where f_i are the functions and x_j are the variables. In the 2D dynamics case, f_i is going to be the 4 time derivatives -- so x-dot, y-dot, vx-dot, and vy-dot, and x_j is the 4 variables, so x, y, vx, and vy. This will be a 4-by-4 matrix:
  </p>
  <math>
   J = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial \dot{x}}{\partial x} &amp; \frac{\partial \dot{x}}{\partial y} &amp; \frac{\partial \dot{x}}{\partial v_x} &amp; \frac{\partial \dot{x}}{\partial v_y}\\
\frac{\partial \dot{y}}{\partial x} &amp; \frac{\partial \dot{y}}{\partial y} &amp; \frac{\partial \dot{y}}{\partial v_x} &amp; \frac{\partial \dot{y}}{\partial v_y}\\\frac{\partial \dot{v_x}}{\partial x} &amp; \frac{\partial \dot{v_x}}{\partial y} &amp; \frac{\partial \dot{v_x}}{\partial v_x} &amp; \frac{\partial \dot{v_x}}{\partial v_y}\\\frac{\partial \dot{v_y}}{\partial x} &amp; \frac{\partial \dot{v_y}}{\partial y} &amp; \frac{\partial \dot{v_y}}{\partial v_x} &amp; \frac{\partial \dot{v_y}}{\partial v_y}
\end{bmatrix}
  </math>
  <p>
   After finding the derivatives, evaluate the 16 functions (the 8 in the first 2 rows are simple) at the stable state [x,y,0,0] to get the final numerical value for the derivative. This should yield the 4 by 4 matrix with no variables that MatLab calculates with fsolve. When you have that, all that's left is to do a "simple" (or at least a single..) calculation to find the eigenvalues with det[J-λI] = 0, where λ are the eigenvalues to check for positivity to see if they're stable.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the general case this calculation's a mess, so I'd recommend choosing the system carefully or using some analytical analysis tool.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hope this helped and that it's not too late for the homework...
