  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  In the lecture 1 notes, it says that lowest two homework scores will be dropped, but in the homepage of Canvas, it says that there is only one homework drop. Which of these is true?
 </paragraph>

  Thanks!

  1 homework drop.  I was still writing the syllabus in Lecture 1, hence the delay.
