 For problem 3 we are asked to set up the DEAs and solve in MATLAB, in lecture we generally use the maximum coordinate system, which for 2D examples includes x,y, theta. Since the masses are constricted to the x axis, is it acceptable to consider the a 1D problem with two DoF, x1 and x2? or do we need to write out the EoM for all 3 DoF for a 2D system and wait for the y's and theta's to drop out?

  No you are fine to consider it as 1D, just as you describe.
