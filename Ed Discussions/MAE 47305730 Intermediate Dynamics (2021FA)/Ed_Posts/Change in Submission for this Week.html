 Hi everyone,
</p>
<p>
 Vaibhav is right.  After seeing how much work everyone is putting into Q3b, but struggling for good solutions, I have decided to delay that question for next Friday, and I will look at it in class on Monday along with the the review of fsolve.
</p>
<p>
 So now, the submission for this week will be:
</p>
<p>
 Q1, Q2, Q3a   today via Gradescope.
</p>
<p>
 Q4 by Monday.  If you are still having trouble with Q4 autograder on Monday, just make sure you have made some submission, and we will mark the effort.
</p>
