  Hi everyone,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Vaibhav is right.  After seeing how much work everyone is putting into Q3b, but struggling for good solutions, I have decided to delay that question for next Friday, and I will look at it in class on Monday along with the the review of fsolve.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  So now, the submission for this week will be:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Q1, Q2, Q3a   today via Gradescope.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Q4 by Monday.  If you are still having trouble with Q4 autograder on Monday, just make sure you have made some submission, and we will mark the effort.
