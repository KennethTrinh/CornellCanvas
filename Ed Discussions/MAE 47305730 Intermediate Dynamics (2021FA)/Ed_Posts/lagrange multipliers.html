  If there is a problem wherein we have both a holonomic AND a non-holonomic constraint, can we solve the modified EL equations using only a lagrange multiplier for the NH constraint, or is it only possible to solve via having a lagrange multiplier for both?

  it seems like the last example problem in lecture 28 (hoop on a cylinder) is relevant to your question--it has a non-holonomic and holonomic constraint
