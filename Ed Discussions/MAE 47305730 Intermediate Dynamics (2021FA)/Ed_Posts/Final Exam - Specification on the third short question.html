  One thing I can add is that you are not going to need the Euler Angle analysis per lecture 38 (this is the start of studying gyroscopes and tops, which we didn't get to).   You should understand how Euler Angles work in general for rotations, and you should know the Euler

   Equations
  </i>
  (lecture 36).
