  Hi Everyone,
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  This thread is for you to post your selected Final Project Topics.  You can do so anonymously if you like but the important part is to make sure you are doing something different to everyone else.  If you would like to discuss with Josephine or myself first, I encourage you to do so.
  <break>
  </break>

  I will edit this post to include some more directions, but I know 1 or 2 students are keen to claim their topic already, so have at it!

  I would like to attempt a Peaucellierâ€“Lipkin linkage. If it is too difficult for me, I may delete this post and change to something else.

  I would like to try modelling the rope out of a moving helicopter from Veritassium. Starting with a 3/4 link pendulum and building up from there.

  I am planning to model an ocean wave energy converter oscillating in the heave and surge directions. This is basically a rigid-body damped spring-loaded inverted pendulum excited by a sinusoidal input (the waves), where the spring stiffness is rotation-dependent (buoyancy).

  I would like to simulate the motion of a swinging stick, demonstrating the chaotic motion of such a mechanism. But I am not sure if this system is tricky enough to be a final project topic. If this choice is not suitable, I would choose a 5-link pendulum instead.

  Is the point to model a rigid stick attached to the end of a pendulum string?  2D or 3D?

  I think this is essentially a double pendulum.  You could probably update your animation of the double pendulum assignment to simulate this  (which could be cool to see!) but not really advancing the analytics too much.

  On the option of a 5 bar pendulum, check the Default Option in the newly updated

  Yes Professor, then I will go for the default option, the triple compound pendulum and the 4-bar linkage. Does this default option mean I have to do both compound pendulum and the 4-bar linkage or choose one of these two mechanisms? Thank you!

  The plan is to solve the EOM for this magnetic system. Here, the yellow squares are rigid panels, and magnetic dipoles are embedded in the panels pointed in the directions drawn. The gray rectangles are flexible hinges connecting the panels. From experimental systems and from Abaqus simulations, we know we can apply an external magnetic field in 2 different directions to get the system to selectively fold vertically or horizontally, but we don't have a good analytical understanding of this system yet, which is what I'd like to fix with this project. If this system proves to be too easy or difficult, I also have designs for systems that are easier or harder, though I think this is on the right difficultly level.

  Yes, hard to gauge right now the difficulty, but I suspect this could be a good project.  Definitely lets catch up once you've made some progress so that we can make sure you are on track.

  Hi! I want to solve this problem. OA and AB are light rods. Mass B is connected with a damper and a spring. The mass can only move in the horizontal skate. A pendulum C is connected to the mass B. The torque M is applied on rod OA.

  Depending on the difficulty of the project, I could also try to include an additional "patient-tracking arm" which essentially just sets the origin for the other arm's reference frame / coordinate system (common in biomedical applications). Although, I think just one arm will be plenty difficult already lol

  Hi Sean, I'm not sure if the extra motors will make this easier or harder, it would be good to discuss this further.  Typically robot arms only move one system at a time, making it momentarily a 1 DoF system. I'm not saying you can't do it, but lets make sure you have set it up well.

  Hello Professor Paridon!
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I intend to model a bofors gun (https://youtu.be/PaK1jFg8JBE) for my final project
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  So the barrel will be taken as an inverted pendulum, wheels as skates and I plan to counter recoil with a spring-damper system (one on each side) along the length of the barrel.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Hope this satisfies the grading criteria!

  I want to model a suspension design for a 3 linkage system along with a belt drive connected to the wheel portion. Will be modeled in 2D with two pulleys, one fixed and the other connected to the "wheel" position. There is a shock absorber with a damper and spring that acts as the suspension. Based on motorcycle suspension, thought it was good because it has rigid linkages, and uses a dashpot. Also the belt drive will be modeled as a normal pulley. Points O, A, B, C are all rigidly attached in the fixed reference frame. The circles labeled D1 and D2 are the pulleys. The center of the D1 pulley is the origin of the fixed reference frame. The green dotted line is the belt drive that connects the two pulleys. Please let me know what you think about it. Thanks!

  Hi Hamza,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  That is effectively a 4 bar linkage, which would be part of the default option.  I would expect to see more attempted than that alone, though it might make for an interesting discussion point different to the energy discussion within the context of the default option.
