  Hi! I'm getting this weird error in my code I'm not sure how to resolve:

  I've printed out my r array and it looks fine (and my dynamic system animation is working completely normally), so I'm not sure why this isn't working. Here are some snippets of the code it's referencing:

  Usually the error that matters is the first error. In your case, "index in position 1 exceeds array bound".  This means that you try to access array using index that is out of its size

  Matlab functions get weird sometimes about when they pass in variables and when they don't - try doing fsolve(@(z) fstatic(z), Z0, options)?

  in your line specifying the fstatic, your function calling doublespringdamper2D does not include the right inputs, it should still include t
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  (unless you did some very clever coding with optional input arguments)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  It should read something like;
 </paragraph>
 <snippet language="txt" line-numbers="true" runnable="true">
  <snippet-file id="code">
   fstatic = @(Z) doublespringdamper2D(t,Z,p);
  </snippet-file>
 </snippet>

  No worries.  The error you received is kind of cryptic in your case, but you can see that the function had a mismatch of inputs between t and Z, which leads to the "exceeding array bounds"
