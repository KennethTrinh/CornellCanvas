  Does ECE 4920 count for anything besides completing the technical writing requirement. Could it count as a Liberal studies ?

  As things stand, it counts only for satisfying the technical-writing requirement.  Definitely not liberal studies, but ECE has never discussed whether to allow ECE 4920 credit(s) as Advisor-approved Elective.
