     Got it. This is a known problem with studentcenter. See the email referenced above or contact ugrad-coordinator@ece.cornell.edu . For Prof. Kan's course, you can enroll in ECE 4880 in the interim to reserve a spot --- the enrollment cap is pooled between the grad and undergrad version. That's obviously not an option with Prof. Zhang's class.
