  If you are considering pursuing MEng here on campus, especially in ECE, participating as a Ugrad TA could potentially help you to be considered for an MEng GTRS position while enrolled as an MEng student.

   This is all my own opinion as a master's applicant for this admissions cycle and not as an admissions decision maker. Therefore, feel free to take my advice with a grain of salt. To answer your question about TAing, being a teaching assistant can enable you to work more with a subject area and improve your knowledge. It can help demonstrate both proficiency and interest, both of which I have observed are important factors in a master's application.
  </p>
  <p>
   To circle back towards your main question about helpful items for master's applications, it will depend on what type of master's application you are doing. Are you trying to do a professional master's? A research master's? Your goal will dictate what items are most relevant. If you are doing a professional master's, I have noticed an emphasis on past experience and projects. Of course, having an internship will help. However, projects can be done in classes, project teams, or even personal endeavors. Experience can also come in the form of TAing and research. If you are looking for a research master's, not surprisingly research experience is king. Though, other experiences will also help.
  </p>
  <p>
   My advice for you would to be have a specific field that you have in mind and identify opportunities to get involved. So TAing, research, project teams (if applicable), internships, and other miscellaneous but relevant items are helpful. You do not need to do everything in your field. You could branch out a bit into peripheral areas. And of course, it will never hurt if you are doing something completely outside of your field.
  </p>
  <p>
   Essentially, do things you enjoy and your passion and experience will shine. I would also leave you with one extra item, do not try to do everything. While it is good to push oneself, a few times I found myself taking opportunities when I was already at/near capacity. Just make sure you give some wiggle room since life happens, and you may find yourself spread too thin to produce the quality you normally can do. Also, I would advise against taking on experiences that you would not enjoy just for the sake of improving your graduate application.
  </p>
  <p>
   I hope this can help with some direction. Again, this is all my opinion that was shaped from the sources I have used during my application process. It would also be helpful to consult professors and staff. I can imagine they will chime in as well.
