  Hi, I am wondering as a sophomore being involve for the first semester in a project team. Do they enroll in MAE 1900 and if take 3 credits, does that count toward AAE? Or do sophomores have to enroll in MAE 4900 for credits? Thank you

  The project team courses are in a bit of flux because they are being centralized (to an extent) across the College of Engineering and across the project teams. My understanding is that students new to project teams are supposed to take ENGRG 1400, Engineering Project Team Onboarding, instead of MAE 1900 or other department-level courses. The student leadership of your project team should have up-to-date information about what to enroll in. Or you can check with Lauren Stulgis, who manages student project teams for the College of Engineering. We can help with questions about ECE-related project teams and how to count project team hours toward graduation.
