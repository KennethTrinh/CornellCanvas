 This was already answered in part by #370, but since that answer was not endorsed I want to make sure. Is it ok to use credits towards both the ECE OTE requirement and a minor in another department? (Provided it's acceptable to the department of the minor)

  Correct, and I'll make sure to endorse #370.
