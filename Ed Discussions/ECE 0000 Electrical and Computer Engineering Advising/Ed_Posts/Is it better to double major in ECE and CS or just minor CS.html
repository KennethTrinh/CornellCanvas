 I'm considering either double major or minor in CS because I think this can help me build more comprehensive ability for my future career. However, double major ECE&amp;CS is much more time-consing than minor CS.
</p>
<p>
 But as an undergraduate, I know little about career development; Could you give me some suggestions or information about the merit and demerit of double major ECE &amp;CS, compared with minor CS ?

  As a double-major, I think I probably should've just stuck with a minor in ECE, but I appreciate the breadth of courses I've had to take to fulfill both majors. I probably wouldn't have taken certain ECE courses that I've found have a surprising amount of application to my interests in CS.

  If you're thinking of "worth it" in terms of if it will make you more employable or more appealing for graduate school, probably not. But if you want to just learn both subjects very deeply I think it is worth it for me at least.

  Also disclaimer, ymmv because a double-major can look very different based on your electives. Most people focus a lot on computer engineering and take courses like CS 4410, ECE 4750, CS 4120, etc. Some people choose to take much more theoretical courses in both CS and ECE, and some people yet still choose to take more robotics oriented courses. All of these are ways of getting a "double major", but the skills that you develop will be quite different.

   I would frankly say whatever Cornell puts on your Academic Transcript in terms of majors and minors does not matter at all. It is all about the material you learn and how you choose to synthesize it. Other people can comment in the answer section about pros/cons of certain CS courses in terms of their applicability to industry and what makes you a good software engineer.

    One tangible benefit of double majoring is that you will have access to direct enrollment in CS 4000/5000 courses and you will not be stuck on the waitlist hoping to get in (like in #391)
