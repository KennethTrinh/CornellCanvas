 I saw that ECE 4740 is offered in the spring but not crosslisted as a 5000 lvl class while in the past it has been crosslisted. Any chance that it will be crosslisted so that M.eng students can take it for credit?

  Good catch! ECE 4740 has actually never had a 5000-level co-meet the way other classes do. Last Fall there was an unorthodox arrangement in which a related graduate course was offered simultaneously to Cornell Tech students (and only Cornell Tech students). The arrangement was complicated for reasons we don't need to get into. I will work with the 4740 instructor and registrar to see if we can get a clean, 5000-level co-meet of ECE 4740 in place for Ithaca M.Eng. students.

   Is there any update on whether this will be crosslisted? I'm currently an undergrad and was planning on doing an MEng next year and taking this class next spring, but if it's not crosslisted then I would want to take it this year instead and take another class during my MEng year

    I would take it next term. Normally there is little impediment to the creation of these co-meets but this one is proving more complicated. It could go either way.

     Update: the 5000-version is good to go: ECE 5744.
