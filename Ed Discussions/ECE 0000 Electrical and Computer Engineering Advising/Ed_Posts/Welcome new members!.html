 Our original plan with the ECE 0000 Canvas site was to invite all ECE affiliates plus unaffiliated students in the College of Engineering who expressed more interest in ECE than other majors in their application to Cornell. It came to my attention recently that the latter group hadn't been invited, so invitations just went out today. Welcome new people! We hope you choose to stay, but you can of course disenroll at any time.

 If you know of anyone who would like to join, just have them search for ECE 0000 on Canvas, or send them this link:
