 During sophomore add period I tried to add 4320 but it basically closed up in like a minute since add period started. Is there still a chance more spots maybe added since without I have not very many engineering classes right now in my schedule and it's one I'm interested doing now than wait another full year.

  As things stand we now we can't raise the cap further. The limiting factor is software licensing, not the size of the room. I suggest reaching out to the instructor.

   Check out #34 in case you haven't already.  ECE 4320 has been a running topic.

     Yeah, I figured it pre-dated your issue, but I thought the cross-list idea might help.  I don't know the nuts and bolts of Add/Drop, but I do know that things churn for a while.
