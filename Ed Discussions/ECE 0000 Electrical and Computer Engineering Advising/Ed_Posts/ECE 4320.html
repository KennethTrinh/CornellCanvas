  During sophomore add period I tried to add 4320 but it basically closed up in like a minute since add period started. Is there still a chance more spots maybe added since without I have not very many engineering classes right now in my schedule and it's one I'm interested doing now than wait another full year.

  Check out #34 in case you haven't already.  ECE 4320 has been a running topic.

  Yeah, I figured it pre-dated your issue, but I thought the cross-list idea might help.  I don't know the nuts and bolts of Add/Drop, but I do know that things churn for a while.

  As things stand we now we can't raise the cap further. The limiting factor is software licensing, not the size of the room. I suggest reaching out to the instructor.
