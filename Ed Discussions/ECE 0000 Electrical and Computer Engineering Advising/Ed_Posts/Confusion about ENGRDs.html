 I'm confused about the ENGRD requirement. Does it have to be a course specifically titled ENGRD? If I take statics as an ECE major, does that count? The ENGRDs seem to be mostly 2000 level. Can I substitute it with another course without the ENGRD title that's at a higher level?

  All ENGRD courses have an ENGRD course number even if they're cross-listed (e.g. ECE 2300 and ENGRD 2300 are the same course).

  If you take statics as an ECE major, it covers your ENGRD requirement.

  To cover ENGRD, you need to take a course that has an ENGRD course number as at least one of its course numbers.  You can petition to cover ENGRD with something higher-level --- that would be a College of Engineering petition, not an ECE petition.
