  Hello all,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I had a question regarding the 1-8 credit requirement regarding the final semester of the undergrad degree. I am hoping to apply to start the early M.eng in fall 2023. As it stands, I am still over the 1-8 credit limit BUT I am hoping to add classes during add/drop that would bring me under the credit requirement.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Is there any policy for adding classes and being brought under the credit requirement? Can I specify this somewhere in the application? (In particular, I am hoping to get off of the internal waitlist for ECE 5475 now that the class is open on the roster)....
 </paragraph>

 <paragraph>
  Thank you

  No such policy exists.  As long as you're 1-8 from finishing once you start Fall 2023, you're good.  Not sure how to fill out the early-admit petition (not the formal application) when you're unsure what courses you'll add ---

  Dave is partially correct.

  The deadline to apply for consideration is 01/15/2022 for Fall 2023 for the Early Admit option. If you're going to still be attempting to figure out your course situation, it will be too late for you to apply.

 <paragraph>
  In order to apply for and be considered for the Early Admit option, you will have to submit both an ECE Undergraduate Checklist, as well as a completed Early Admit Petition (these are both in addition to the actual online application itself). If your Checklist (i.e. your graduation plan) is not approved, meaning you have more than 8 credit hours left in your undergraduate degree requirements, you cannot be considered for Early Admit.

  What if I fill in the checklist with a course that I intend to add during the add/drop period? That is, what if my checklist has courses that I am not enrolled in as of January 15 but will be after add/drop?

  This would bring me under the credit requirement.

  If you have questions about this, contact me directly - this is not the best way to do this.
