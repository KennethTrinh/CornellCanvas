  Hi, I'm looking to finish up my external specialization within ECE this upcoming semester. I've currently taken ECE 3100 and currently enjoying ECE 4750. I'm looking to take another ECE course this upcoming semester, but I haven't taken circuits before. Is there any upper level (masters included) classes that would be recommended for me to take?

  All of the robotics courses (ECE 4160, ECE 4180, ECE 4240) are good choices if you have a CS background and some probability. ECE 4200 if you haven't already taken CS 4780 (or maybe you do want to take it to get another perspective on ML that's from ECE instead of CS). ECE 4670 could also be an interesting one but it seems kind of heavy on the workload (maybe someone who's taken it can attest). Hope that helps!
