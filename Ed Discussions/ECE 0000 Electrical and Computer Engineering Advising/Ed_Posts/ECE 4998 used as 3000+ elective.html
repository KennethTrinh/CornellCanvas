  Hello,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I saw ECE 4998, project team course, could be counted as an Outside Technical Elective.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Could it be used instead as a ECE Upper-level elective for 3000+?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thank you

  The
  <link href="https://www.ece.cornell.edu/ece/programs/undergraduate-programs/majors/program-requirements"/>
  ECE Program Requirements website states:
 </paragraph>
 <blockquote>
  Also unacceptable are independent project courses such as ECE 4999, student project teams, and seminar courses such as ECE 5870 and 5880.
 </blockquote>
 <paragraph>
  I would assume ECE 4998 falls under this as "student project teams" and would only count towards OTE and AAE (re: #62).
