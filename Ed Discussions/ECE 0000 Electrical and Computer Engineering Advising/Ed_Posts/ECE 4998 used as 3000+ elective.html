 Hello,
</p>
<p>
 I saw ECE 4998, project team course, could be counted as an Outside Technical Elective.
</p>
<p>
 Could it be used instead as a ECE Upper-level elective for 3000+?
</p>
<p>
 Thank you
</p>

  The
  <a href="https://www.ece.cornell.edu/ece/programs/undergraduate-programs/majors/program-requirements">
   ECE Program Requirements website
  </a>
  states:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  Also unacceptable are independent project courses such as ECE 4999, student project teams, and seminar courses such as ECE 5870 and 5880.
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  I would assume ECE 4998 falls under this as "student project teams" and would only count towards OTE and AAE (re: #62).
