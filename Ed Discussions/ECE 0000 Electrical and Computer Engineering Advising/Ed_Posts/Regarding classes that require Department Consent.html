 Any course that says "
 <b>
  <underline>
   department consent required
  </underline>
 </b>
 " is currently being managed by the student services office via an internal waitlist.
</p>
<p>
 If you are interested in one of the courses and would like to be put on a waitlist please email
 <underline>
  <i>
   ugrad-coordinator@ece.cornell.edu
  </i>
 </underline>
 with the following information:
</p>
<list style="bullet">
 <li>
  <p>
   Course code
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Which discussion/lecture you want
  </p>
 </li>
</list>
<p>
 You can Cc the faculty of the course.
</p>
<p>
 Please be aware that some of these waitlists are already very long, so we recommend having an alternative course.
</p>
<p>
 There is no need to ask about your spot on the waitlist, we will share enrollment access with students when we have it.

  The root problem here is that Peoplesoft, the database system that forms the backend for studentcenter, does not have a satisfactory waitlist system. So we need to manually effect waitlist functionality by requiring department consent to enroll in a class that has filled up and then emailing PINs to students as spots become available.
