 Hi, I was wondering why this course disappeared from the course roster, and if it's planned on being offered in the future? Thanks!

  Dunno. I have an email out to Prof. Yi Wang of BME/Weill. That class is a cross-list from BME (you can tell from the catalog description because it says "For description, see BME 6180"), so BME owns and operates it. If they choose to offer it, it magically appears in our roster, and if they don't, it doesn't. We have no control over it.
 </p>

  I will report back if I hear anything from BME.

   Word from BME is that they will definitely offer it Fall 2023, and they can potentially offer it this Fall if there is student interest. If you are interested in taking the ECE 5180 this Fall, please as a comment to that effect. I will separately ask the M.Eng. students.

    Thanks for your help! I'm interested in taking it as long as it does not conflict with any of my other classes- did BME specify a time slot for it?

     No timeslot yet. This is very much in the preliminary stages.
