 Would taking classes like ECE4160 that is crosslisted as CS4758 count as an upper-level elective while still satisfying a CS course to be used for a minor?

  I'd doing the CS minor as well. For the CS department, you need to take the course under the CS title for it to count.

  For the record, it's ECE 4180 that is crosslisted as CS 4758, not ECE 4160.

  ECE 4160 is a new class and I don't believe it has any crosslistings as of yet.

   Yes, but take them with the CS course designations if you want CS to count them toward the minor.

    But the CS course still counts as an upper-level ECE elective?

     Indeed it does.  ECE doesn't care how you register for a cross-listed course.
