 What is the minimum amount of credits required for last semester seniors to take? I heard that the
 <b>
  ECE department still considers students full-time
 </b>
 if they take under 12 credits.
</p>
<list style="bullet">
 <li>
  <p>
   Does this mean that the University Registrar and College of Engineering will also consider us full-time students?
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   If the minimum isn't 12 credits, then what is the minimum amount of credits I would need to be considered full time by ECE and the College of Engineering?
  </p>
 </li>
</list>

  Minimum is officially 12, but ECE won't bother you if you go under during your last semester.  Financial aid might not like it if they find out, but I've always thought that was irrelevant because a student could, like, fake-enroll in &gt;12 and drop stuff at the last minute.  Not recommending that by any means!

   A couple of things to add:
  </p>
  <list style="bullet">
   <li>
    <p>
     From the
     <a href="https://courses.cornell.edu/content.php?catoid=52&amp;navoid=21318">
      courses of study
     </a>
     : "Full time undergraduate students are expected to enroll in a minimum of twelve (12) academic credit hours of college-approved coursework per semester. Exceptions are granted only at the discretion of the studentâ€™s college." So the definition of "full-time" is not really up to ECE.

     Beyond financial aid, the number of credits you enroll in could have implications for income taxes, health insurance, and immigration status (for foreign students).

  </list>
