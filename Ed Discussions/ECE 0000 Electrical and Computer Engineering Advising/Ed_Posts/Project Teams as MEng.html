  Is there a specific class equivalent to MAE 4900 (or ECE 4998) for grad/MEng students that wish to take project teams for credit, or would you just enroll in an independent study with an appropriate advisor (ex: MAE 6910(?) or ECE 5997)?

  Nothing at the 4000 level can be used to count towards MEng degree requirements.

  As for enrolling in something else in order to potentially earn credit at the 5000 level, I honestly can't say. You would have to discuss that with the Team Project Advisor. My guess would be that you can't do that.

  When the New York State Department of Education changed the requirements for what was considered a graduate level course (i.e. 5000+ only), this meant that Project Team courses could no longer be counted as Tech Electives for either Early Admits or actual enrolled MEng students.
