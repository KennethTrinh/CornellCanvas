  Would ECE 4110 satisfy the probability requirement if we haven't taken ECE 3100? Furthermore, can I enroll in ECE 4110 without any issues if I haven't taken ECE 3100?

  This is complicated because of the Foundation requirement that you take one of 3100 or 3250.  I'll write a more comprehensive answer when back at a computer.

  Back at a computer now.

  I know of one student who took ECE 4110 without having taken ECE 3100 (or ORIE 2700) and petitioned successfully to have ECE 4110 count for prob/stats.  That student found ECE 4110 challenging without the pre-requisite.  That student also took ECE 3250 and thereby covered the Foundation Course requirement I alluded to above.

  Thus the answer to part of your question is a qualified Yes based on petition history, but the answer to the rest of your question is murkier.

  I was planning to take ECE 3100, but don't see it in the offering. I thought it had been switched to the fall last year. Will ECE 3100 be offered this spring?

  ECE 3100 switched back to its customary pre-pandemic spring slot this academic year.

  The 3100 prereq for 4110 is pretty strict since 4110 directly extends what you learn in 3100. So you can enroll in 4110, but be prepared to learn two semester's worth of material in one semester. Also be advised that probability as a subject does not lend itself well to cramming --- it requires a whole different way of thinking compared to other math and physics courses. My experience is that it takes about a semester for the material to really gel for most students. And ECE 4110 will assume it has already gelled for you from day 1.

  I taught ECE 4110 many years ago, and I did have one student who enrolled without 3100 (or ENGRD 2700 or similar) who did very well. So it is possible. But he was an atypical student. 4110 usually begins by summarizing all of 3100 in about two weeks . You could attend the 4110 lectures for the first week or so and judge how feasible it is for you.
