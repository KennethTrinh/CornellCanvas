  I know that the Early Admit process works for students in their last semester and is typically the studentâ€™s 8th semester in which they would be taking those M.Eng courses while still being considered an undergrad, but I was wondering if it is possible for this to be the 7th semester (a Fall semester), and if so, what would the application calendar look like for that?

  If your "early-M.Eng. semester" is the fall, then your application deadline was 15 January before that fall.

  Students are only allowed to pursue the Early Admit option in their FINAL SEMESTER of enrollment as an undergraduate student. What semester that may be could vary for some students, as there are those that may end up graduating early. In general, yes, the Early Admit option is mostly for students in what would be their 8th and final semester of enrollment.

  For students that are applying for the Early Admit semester to be in the spring, the deadline to submit all completed application materials for consideration would be October 15th.
