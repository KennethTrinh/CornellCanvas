 For next semester I am considering taking 4750 or 4770. 4750 seems like a prerequisite for a lot of digital classes. Is 4770 a prerequisite for any higher-level robotics classes?

  ECE 4770 is recommended for Fast Robots, currently a special topics course that I am expecting to become a permanent offering starting next academic year.

   If I had to choose, I think I would also take 4750 first, because if you really enjoy the course, you might want to take 5750 (advanced computer architecture) the following fall, which has 4750 as a prerequisite.

    I was also debating between the two and it seems like 4750 is a pre-req for a handful of other courses but 4770 is not so I am probably going to take 4750 first
