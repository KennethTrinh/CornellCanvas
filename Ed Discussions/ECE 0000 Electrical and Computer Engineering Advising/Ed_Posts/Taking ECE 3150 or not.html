  Due to some scheduling issues, I will most likely have to take ECE 3030 anyway. After that, would I better also take ECE 3150 if I am interested in Computer Engineering? Is it a prerequisite of any upper-level classes that I should take based on my interest?

  ECE 3150 isn't crucial to computer engineering.  ECE 3140 is.  One borderline course: ECE 4740, which might require ECE 3150.
