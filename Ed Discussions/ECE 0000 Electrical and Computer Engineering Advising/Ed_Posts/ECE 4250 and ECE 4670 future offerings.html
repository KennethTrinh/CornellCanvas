  Any ideas when ECE 4250 will be offered again? I was hoping to take it this semester.

  Current plan: ECE 4250 will be offered in Fall 2022.

  Similarly, I know that in the past, ECE 4670 has been offered in the fall. Will it be offered this coming fall as well?

  I think not.  This is at least the third academic year in a row with ECE 4670 in the spring.
