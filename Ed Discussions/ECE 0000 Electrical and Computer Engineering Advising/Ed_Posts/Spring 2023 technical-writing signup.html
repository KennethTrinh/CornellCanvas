 Recall that ENGRC 3025 is a relatively new option --- the Engineering Communications Program folks report that the course, titled Creating and Communicating Your Digital Professionalism, "has become popular with ECE and CS majors for fulfilling the Engineering Communications Requirement," and that they will offer two sections of the course next spring as they did this semester.

<p>
 If you are a senior in the Spring 2023 semester who would like to fulfill their

  Engineering Communications Requirement
  this spring, the Engineering Communications Program is offering two sections of
  <link href="https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/SP23/class/ENGRC/3500"/>
  ENGRC 3500 (section 102 is asynchronous) and one section of
  <link href="https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/SP23/class/ENGRC/3350"/>
  ENGRC 3350. Registration is limited to second-semester seniors during pre-enroll in order to prioritize those who are graduating in May 2023.

<p>
 During pre-enroll, if you do not gain entry into your desired section, join the online waitlist for these courses in Student Center. During regular enrollment in January 2023, all seniors (first- and second-semester) will have the opportunity to register if seats remain. Once seniors have had a chance to enroll, we will open up any remaining seats to juniors.
