 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 I am looking into winter study abroad programs that are outside of Cornell University study abroad programs. (Like outside resources) I am wondering who do I talk to about study abroad and getting the courses approval so it would count as liberal studies. Also are there any scholarship/fundings for global travel like this.
</p>
<p>
 Thank you!
</p>

  It's generally easy to get transfer credit for liberal studies.  For each course you fill out a form that requires a few signatures.  For details, I'd suggest you contact someone in Engineering Advising --- Ryan DeLany would be a good choice for that.
