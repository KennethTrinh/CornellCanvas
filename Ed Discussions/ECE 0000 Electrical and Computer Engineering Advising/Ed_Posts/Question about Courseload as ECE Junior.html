 Hello!
</p>
<p>
 I had a question about the typical incoming ECE junior schedule. How many ECE classes do students normally take per semester that's manageable?
</p>
<p>
 I am currently looking into 3 ECE courses (3030, 4750, 3250 or 4450) , ENGRD 2210, and a finance course for my business minor.
</p>
<p>
 Does this look like a feasible schedule?
</p>

  I took 3030 and 4750 together with 3100 in the same semester, and those three alone were enough to keep me busy. 4750 especially was a ton of work and I wouldn't recommend a heavy courseload with that class. If you think you can do it, go for it!

   Would it be possible to only take 2 ECE course and an ENGRD and still graduate in time?
  </p>
  <p>
   I just want to see what's a reasonable amount to take per semester that's not too insane! More spreadout would be ideal

    It all depends on how many courses you've already taken so far. For me I was able to figure out a schedule to graduate on time without stretching myself too thin that semester. If you're a first semester junior next year and assuming you have all the 2000s and engineering reqs out of the way, I am pretty sure you can graduate taking 3-4 classes per semester.

     Thank you for all the help!! I think I got the requirements out of the way (except one ENGRD XXXX) so I would definitely try a route of taking a more manageable semester

     Appreciate it once again!!
