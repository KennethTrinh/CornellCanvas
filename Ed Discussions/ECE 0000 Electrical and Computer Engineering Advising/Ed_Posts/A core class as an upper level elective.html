  I understand we are supposed to take at least one of ECE 3100 and ECE 3250. Because I already took ECE 3250, can ECE 3100 be counted as an upper level 3000+ elective even though it is a core class?

  Yes ECE 3100 can be counted as a 3000+ elective.

  After you have satisfied the foundation courses requirement (at least 3 of 5), the remaining 2 courses can be counted as an upper-level 3000+ elective.
