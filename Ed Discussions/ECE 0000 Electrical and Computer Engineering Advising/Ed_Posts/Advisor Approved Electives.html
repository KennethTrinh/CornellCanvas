  I am a bit confused as to what is considered to be an AAE and how it differs from the Liberal Studies requirements as they can both be taken as S/U. Can someone clarify this issue?

  Pretty much any legit credit-bearing activity (course, project team, research, etc.) works as AAE.  Exceptions include stuff like PE, ENGRG 1050, AEWs, etc.

  Advisor Approved Electives must be from courses 1100 level or higher and cannot double count toward any other degree requirement (so separate from the Liberal Studies requirement).  You will want your faculty advisor's permission on what you count as Advisor Approved Electives (6 credits minimum).  The College of Engineering only allows optional S grades to be used toward Advisor Approved Electives and Liberal Studies.

  ECE approves Advisor-approved Electives centrally, so in ECE (also in CS and probably some other majors) you don't need approval from your faculty advisor.
