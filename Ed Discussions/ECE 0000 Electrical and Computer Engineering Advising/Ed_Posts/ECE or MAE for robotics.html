 Hello, I am deciding between taking ECE or MAE (torn because I really like both), but want to minor in robotics regardless of what I choose. Do you have any advice on what major would be better to take for a robotics minor ?
</p>
<p>
 Thx for any suggestions/advice

  See #106.

  FWIW I think the folks who designed the robotics minor made it equally accessible to MAEs and ECEs, but I'm not an expert!
