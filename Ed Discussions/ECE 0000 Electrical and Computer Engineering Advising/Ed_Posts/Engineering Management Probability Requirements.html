 Hello, I am heavily leaning towards getting an meng in engineering management. In the handbook for engineering management

 It states that a probability class is required (ENGRD 2700, CEE 3040, or ECE 3100). However, I was wondering if requirements surrounding this have changed, since ECE 2720 now counts for an ECE probability requirement. Does this mean that I have to take 3100, or is this something that only the engineering management faculty would know?

  This is something only the engineering management faculty would know.  i suspect that the probability content in ECE 2720 won't suffice for them, but you'll have to check.
