  Just wanted to say thank you for all the prompt responses on this Ed, itâ€™s been insanely helpful to ask questions here instead of waiting for an advisor meeting that sometimes takes a while to acquire.

  You're welcome. I'm glad people find it useful. It is helpful for us as well --- more efficient than email, and I appreciate knowing what is on students' minds.

  This pre-enroll has not been as smooth as we hoped for. We were scrambling to get some courses added last-minute, so we didn't do the final check of the roster that we usually do. If we had, I think we would have caught some of these cap issues, etc.

  And thanks to the students who've contributed quick answers to questions that lie outside the scope of the readily-at-hand day-to-day knowledge of us faculty and staff members.  Yup, that scope is far from comprehensive.
