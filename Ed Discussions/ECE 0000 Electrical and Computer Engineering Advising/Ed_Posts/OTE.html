  How can I go about asking for one of my higher-level ECE courses to be considered for my OTE requirement? I want to see if ECE 4320 could fall under this special permission.

  You don't really have to ask.  We would be able to justify it somehow.

  Will it's approval as an OTE cause the course to not be considered as a ECE 4000+ requirement fulfillment course.

  A course you use as OTE can't count as an Upper-level ECE Elective, and vice versa.

  Can CS 2110 count as an OTE and advanced programming requirement?

  Yup.  The advanced-programming thing, like technical writing, is just a "check-off" --- it doesn't "eat a course" like a line in the upper four tables on the Checklist.
