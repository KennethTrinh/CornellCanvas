 The policy for students for students entering Fall 2019 and earlier states you must take "at least six courses chosen from at least three of the 13 categories listed below totaling a minimum of 18 credits."
</p>
<p>
 For the past few years I have understood this, based on my interpretation and guidance from advisors, as meaning you must take "
 <b>
  [at least 6 courses]
 </b>
 totaling a minimum of 18 credits;" i.e. it is acceptable to take more than 6 courses in order to hit the 18 credit requirement. However, seeing that there are only six spaces on the graduation checklist, I am realizing this can also be interpreted as saying you must take "at least
 <b>
  [6 courses totaling a minimum of 18 credits]
 </b>
 ." This question also applies to the AAE requirement, which is listed in the handbook both as a non-specific "six credits of electives" and a "2 courses, 6-credit minimum."
</p>
<p>
 These are significantly different interpretations that I'm concerned could potentially prevent me from graduating on time. Any clarification would be greatly appreciated, as I can't find any further specification.

  We have an ongoing experimental project to validate graduation checklists by Python script. If that pans out, we can just publish the script, which would eliminate ambiguities that arise when the requirements are described in English. In the meantime, feel free to ask.

   Don't worry about the number of lines on the ECE Graduation Checklist.  You can cover LS with more than six courses and AAE with more than two.
