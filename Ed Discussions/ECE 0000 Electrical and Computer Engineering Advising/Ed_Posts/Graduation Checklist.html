  I am a first-semester senior now and I would like to check whether my graduation checklist looks good. Who should I email my checklist to in order to get some advice? Thank you so much in advance.

  Scott has been watching Sharif's SFT, I think.  SFT to ugrad-coordinator doesn't work, as it happens.

  Just wondering, since I have submitted my checklist twice to Sharif's SFT and looks like neither have been looked at. Just want to confirm ECE has all my latest classes to confirm I can graduate ðŸ™ƒ
