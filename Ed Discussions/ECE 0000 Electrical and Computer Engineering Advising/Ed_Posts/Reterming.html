 Suppose I'm a sophomore in ECE and I think I can graduate early. I'd like to be reclassified as a junior. Or suppose I'm a junior and I'd like to be reclassified as a senior. Is this possible and how?

  Along this line of thought, let’s say I’m on track to be an early admit Meng student in Fall 22. Would I also need to “reterm” as a first semester senior during SP ‘22 even though I’m a junior or do I wait till Fall ‘22 to declare an early graduation as an undergrad while I complete my early admit Meng semester.

   It makes no difference.  Like, you can graduate early without ever re-terming.  Re-terming helps mainly in two ways, as I understand it:
  </p>
  <p>
   1. It gives you higher priority at pre-enroll.
  </p>
  <p>
   2. It makes you eligible for some internships available only to, say, juniors or above.

   You can assume I'm very excited about being in ECE if it makes a difference.

    If you're so excited, why do you want to finish early?  :-\

  E-mail ECE's Undergraduate Coordinator at ugrad-coordinator@ece.cornell.edu indicating that, based on your progress through the program, you think you might be eligible for junior standing.  You'll need to submit an ECE Graduation Checklist, as well.  ECE will review your progress and, if appropriate, "re-term" you as a junior by notifying the engineering registrar.
