 In a previous post, it was said that the practicums were not required for cross-listed courses.
</p>
<p>
 Does that mean that a practicum may be counted as an elective by itself?
</p>
<p>
 Specifically, Can I count the Compilers Practicum as an ECE elective, in addition to the class, that is both counts as two ECE 4000 Level electives?

  I think yes, but the minimum credits for the 6 electives is 22. Both OS and compilers are 3 credits with 2-credit practicum, so I think you can't really use it for ECE elective if all other classes you are taking are 4-credits?

  You can't use just the practicum from OS or Compilers to cover a 3000+ or 4000+ ECE Elective slot.
