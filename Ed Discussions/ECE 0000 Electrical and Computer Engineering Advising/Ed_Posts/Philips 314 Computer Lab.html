  I don't really know if this is the right location to ask this, but in Philips 314 computer lab, a majority of the computers do not work, ie they will not turn on. It can make working on class difficult as accessing the server through mobaXterm is much slower than in the lab. So I was wondering if staff were aware of these issues and/or had any plans for the room.

  I have not heard this kind of feedback from anyone else to date regarding 314 PH.
