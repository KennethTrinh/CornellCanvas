  Not sure about this one --- will add to list for ECE committee to look at.  You might be referencing #270 --- I didn't see the additional question about BIONB 4330 --- my "Correct" response was to the question about having a  BIO pre-requisite being sufficient for OTE.

   Sounds good - thank you!

   When will the ECE committee approx make a decision on this? (I'm just trying to figure out if I should take this class or not)

    Soon it's part of a larger OTE discussion.  The committee meets roughly every week during the semester.

     Ok thank you! I assumed since it was a science course (Cognitive Science) and from my day in the course it seems to cover neuroscience and physics/biology.

       Thank you! Would like to add that the class discusses technical topics like discrete math &amp; complex computation within our mind using states &amp; transitions (reminds me of Mealy and Moore Machines)
      </p>

       Sorry for spamming this reply thread - I just wanted to advocate for the class because of my interest in it &amp; it's connection to ECE

        Please feel free to share such evidence.  It's just the kind of thing ECE needs to see when deciding how to handle interdisciplinary courses.
