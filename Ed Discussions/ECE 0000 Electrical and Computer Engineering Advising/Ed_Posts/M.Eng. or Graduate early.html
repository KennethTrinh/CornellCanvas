  I was planning on applying to the early admit M.Eng. program in ECE for the coming spring, but have now realized I have enough credits to graduate a semester early.

    Do I have to have 1 credit left in my undergrad to apply for early admission? Could I just choose to take an extra class to count towards my undergrad degree?

    If I don't get accepted to the masters program can I choose to graduate early?

  Officially, you need at least 1 credit for your bachelor's entering Semester 8 for you to start Early M.Eng. during Semester 8.  If you chose to finish in Semester 7, you could apply for regular M.Eng, starting in Semester 8.  Iin that case, you'd be an M.Eng. on the books during Semester 8 rather than an undergraduate on the books as you would have been in Early-M.Eng. mode.

  All that said, I've seen students start Early M.Eng. in Semester 8 who could have graduated after Semester 7 had they filled out their Checklists differently.  I guess you could say the department looked the other way.

  To further clarify, during an Early Admit semester, you are not considered an actual MEng student. You can't be considered an MEng student until you graduate and complete your undergraduate degree requirements.

  Participating in an Early Admit semester is taking courses / credit hours that will count towards an eventual MEng degree. Yes, this sounds like I'm splitting hairs, but it's an importatn clarification to be aware of.

  You would need to submit a Checklist in order to confirm that your plan to apply for the Early Admit is indeed valid. You would need to leave something as Dave said, even if it's just 1 credit hour, for the Spring 2023 semester in order to participate in the Early Admit option in your final semester of enrollment.

  The deadline to apply for consideration for the EArly Admit optio for the spring would be October 15th. When you're back on campus for the fall, come see me and we can discuss this all in further detail.
