 While updating my checklist in preparation for preenroll, I realized that after spring '23 I'll only have 4 classes left (all upper-level ECE classes, i'm a current junior). I'm wondering what my options might be because it feels like a waste to take 2 semesters to do 4 classes, but I don't think taking 4 upper-level ECE classes in one semester is a good idea?(workload wise, etc. if I'm wrong about this let me know, but sounds like a lot). I used to think I wanted to do an early Meng but am not so convinced anymore for various reasons. so basically I dont know what to do with my life
</p>
<p>
 If someone could either: 1) analyze the options of suck it up and graduate early vs early meng vs take 2 semesters to do 4 classes, 2) think of any other options i have in this situation, or 3) point me to who I should talk to to help me with this situation, I would really appreciate it. I'm sorry if this is too confusing or not the right place to ask this

  I agree with Prof Wagner in that it depends a lot on the courses you're taking. I've been taking 4 technical courses each semester for the past few years now and it's definitely tough, but not as bad if you select the right combination of courses.
 </p>

  When it comes to M.Eng vs finishing early, you could always take three ECE classes this spring and save the last one for the fall and do the early M.Eng. Or you could probably just finish up the degree this spring. If you have two ECE classes left next fall it might be hard to graduate early, so you could just graduate in the fall. It's really a personal choice up to you because it depends on your goals.
 </p>
 <p>
  That being said I'd say if you're going to take 4 ECE classes at the same time select them carefully. Definitely don't take a ton of really hard CDEs - maybe take one that has less exams (or no exams!). Also if you're good at math maybe take one of the more mathy-ECE classes (4200 or something similar).
 </p>
 <p>
  Personally I'd opt for just taking 3 ECE classes in the spring and considering the early M.Eng, but if that's not your cup of tea don't force it. Good luck!

   I think other students are probably better able to answer parts of this question. I'll just point out that it can't simultaneously be true that it is wasteful to take 2 semesters to do 4 ECE classes and that taking 4 upper-level ECE classes in one semester is bad idea. If taking 4 upper-level ECE courses in one semester is indeed a bad idea, then spreading them over two semesters is hardly wasteful.
  </p>
  <p>
   On the merits of taking 4 ECE classes at once, I'd be interested to hear from other students. My own sense is that it depends a lot on the classes. Taking four CDEs/classes with big design projects is probably unwise, especially if you are the sort of team member that ends up shouldering a lot of the work. But a mix of different types of classes is probably fine. At this point in your career, you're quite experienced at taking ECE classes. What's the max number of ECE classes you've taken in the past and how did it go? Can you extrapolate from past semesters to a hypothetical SP23 term with 4 ECE classes?

    If you have four courses left to complete in Fall 2023, that would be more than the required 8 or fewer credit hours left to complete in your undergraduate degree, in order to qualify for the Early Admit option for MEng. So likely would not be a viable option for you to consider for the Fall 2023 semester.
   </p>
   <p>
    If you opted to leave one of those four courses for Spring 2024, you could consider applying for Early Admit for the Spring 2024 semester and use the rest of your time that term to take courses to count towards an eventual MEng degree.
   </p>

    Hope this helps somewhat.
