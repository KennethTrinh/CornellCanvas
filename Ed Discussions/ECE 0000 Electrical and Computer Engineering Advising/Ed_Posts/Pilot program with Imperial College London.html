 I just sent information about a pilot summer research exchange program with Imperial College London to ugrads@ece.cornell.edu. So check your inbox if you are interested in summer research and working abroad. The information sheet and application form are attached here reference. If you are affiliated with ECE and didn't receive the email, let me know.
