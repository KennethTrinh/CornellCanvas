  Why is 4250 no longer a CDE? Not enough lab material?

   The previous instructor moved to Cornell Tech, and the next instructor is redesigning the class. The new version is not expected to have a big design project.

   It will be offered in the Fall, although it is losing its CDE status. Do you not see it in Student Center?

    Okay but will ECE 4250 be offered next spring? I know in the past it has been.

     No. I'm expecting it to become a Fall course. The staffing works out that way, and it actually makes for a better balance with ECE 4670.

     That's unfortunate, because I was planning on taking that to fulfill my CDE requirement, as I am interested in a signals concentration. Will ECE 4670 still be offered as a CDE course next Spring? I can't think of any other signals-based CDE courses.

      The plan is to offer 4670 in the Spring as a CDE as usual. I'm also hoping to get some additional signals courses listed as CDEs as well, including ECE 4200 and possibly a new image processing class. The plan to offer 4670 in the Spring is pretty firm --- we'll need to see about the other two.

       Will these potential new CDE classes be offered in the fall?

        No for ECE 4200. The plan is to offer that in the Spring. Image processing will likely be in the Fall, although it is unclear if it will qualify as a CDE this Fall.

         What is the course number for the new image processing class?

          The course doesn't exist yet.

           I see. I am graduating next Spring so I was hoping for more signals focused options to fulfill my CDE requirement.

            We used to have two signals CDEs per year. Next academic year the number will be between 1 and 3 almost surely, with the modal outcome being 2.

      Will this status still be effective Fall 2022 because I still see ECE 4250 listed under CDE satisfactory courses for program requirements?

       Yes, it will be effective in the Fall, and 4250 will dropped from the CDE list.
