  Is it healthy to take ECE3100, ECE2720, ECE2300, and CS 2800 (plus a 3-credits 2000+ Lib Study course)  in one semester?

  Definitely difficult but doable I suppose? There's overlap between 3100 and 2720 which makes it more manageable imo and similarly with 2800 and 3100.

  Very mathy semester though - expect the weekly pset grind to be a bit tougher than usual
