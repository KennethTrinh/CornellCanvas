 If I was only able to take my Project Team as S/U - Can I count that as my OTE?
</p>
<p>
 This is specific to Concrete Canoe (they didn't offer it for a grade up until this semester) and I would love to use it as an OTE since I gained technical knowledge
</p>

  Technically I think you're okay ---- two rules apply here:
 </p>
 <p>
  = You can use up to 3 credits of student project team toward OTE, and
 </p>
 <p>
  = If you want to count something toward OTE and take it S/U, it has to be S/U-exclusive.
 </p>
 <p>
  It looks to me as if these rules allow what you want to do.
