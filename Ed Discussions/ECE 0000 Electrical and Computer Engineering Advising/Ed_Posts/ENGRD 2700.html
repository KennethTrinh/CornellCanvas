  Does ENGRD 2700 count towards the probability requirement. Additionally, is it possible to convert CS 2110 into an ENGRI course and replace the cs requirement with another course?

  Yeah 2700 fulfills the probability requirement (but so does 2720 I believe if you're an ECE major and that's a required course anyways)

  I think you could convert CS 2110 into an ENGRI but then you'd need another ENGRD (and 2100, 2720, and 2300 won't count)

  What do you mean by "convert CS 2100 into an ENGRI"? Older handbooks used to allow for ENGRI to be substituted by an ENGRD but is no longer included in modern handbooks and would require petition.

  The engineering college administers the ENGRI and intro-CS requirements, so you need to consult them (perhaps via Engineering Advising) about petitionable variations on those requirements.
