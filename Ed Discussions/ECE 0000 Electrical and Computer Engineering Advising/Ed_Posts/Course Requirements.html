 I'm a bit confused about what courses to take in order to be on track in fulfilling my requirements. I'm not sure if I should consult the Engineering Handbook for the year I entered which is Fall 2020, since some of the courses like ECE 2200 are no longer being offered, or that for Fall 2021 or just reference the ECE website.

  The Engineering Handbook for students matriculating in Fall 2021 should be updated with those changes.

   Sorry, I just corrected it. I meant to say I entered in Fall 2020. I don't know if I should consult the Fall 2020 handbook or Fall 2021.

    As far as I am aware, the changes made are retroactive. You can get the FA21 flowchart from the FA20 flowchart by replacing ECE 2200 with ECE 2720 and by replacing ECE 3400 with any ECE elective (of which ECE 3400 can still count towards).

      One additional detail: the ECE elective replacing 3400 must be 3000+ and must be a technical course.
