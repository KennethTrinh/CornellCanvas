 It looks like grad students filled up all 35 spots of ECE 4200 (x-list ECE 5420).
</p>
<p>
 Is there any chance that a decent amount of spots are added so that undergrads (specifically seniors) can take it before graduation?

  The cap has been increased and should show as open in Student Center. Thanks for your patience!

   Already in progress. The cap of 35 was an error --- it was supposed to be 100.

     It's not allowing us to enroll because the discussion section is full
