  It looks like grad students filled up all 35 spots of ECE 4200 (x-list ECE 5420).
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Is there any chance that a decent amount of spots are added so that undergrads (specifically seniors) can take it before graduation?

  Already in progress. The cap of 35 was an error --- it was supposed to be 100.

  The cap has been increased and should show as open in Student Center. Thanks for your patience!
