  Hi, I saw ECE 4920 is a1-credit course that counts towards the Technical Writing Requirement. Would it also count towards an Upper-level ECE elective?

  Is it possible for the
  <link href="https://www.ece.cornell.edu/ece/programs/undergraduate-programs/majors/program-requirements"/>
  ECE Program Requirements website to be worded more specifically regarding ECE 4920?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The current phrase is:
 </paragraph>
 <blockquote>
  Alternatively, a student can fulfill the requirement by making a special arrangement with ECP or, in a few cases, with a willing course instructor. For example, a student who takes ECE 4760 has the option of taking a 1- or 2-credit follow-on during which the student writes up their ECE 4760 project.
 </blockquote>
 <paragraph>
  The example makes it seem like its a petitioned ENGRC 3023 (1 cred) instead of acknowledging the pre-approved existing ECE 4920 (1 cred). Specifying the course codes and in which cases they apply may make it easier for a student to determine the options available to them.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Another feasible option is just to link the
  <link href="https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/students/undergraduate-students/curriculum/engineering-communications-program/technical"/>
  ECP website (which has better details regarding 3023 + other options) and just mention that ECE 4920 is one option commonly used by ECEs.

  When I wrote that section, I wasn't sure exactly what status the follow-on to ECE 4760 had --- for all I knew, it was another one of those petitioned add-ons.  Since then (or maybe even before then but under my radar), as you point out, ECE 4920 has become an established on-the-books course that's approved for ECP credit.  I'll figure something out.
