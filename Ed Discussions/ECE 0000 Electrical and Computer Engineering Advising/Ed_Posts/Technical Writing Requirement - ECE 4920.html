 Hi, I saw ECE 4920 is a1-credit course that counts towards the Technical Writing Requirement. Would it also count towards an Upper-level ECE elective?

    Is it possible for the
    <a href="https://www.ece.cornell.edu/ece/programs/undergraduate-programs/majors/program-requirements">
     ECE Program Requirements
     website to be worded more specifically regarding ECE 4920?
    </a>
   </p>
   <p>
    The current phrase is:
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    Alternatively, a student can fulfill the requirement by making a special arrangement with ECP or, in a few cases, with a willing course instructor. For example, a student who takes ECE 4760 has the option of taking a 1- or 2-credit follow-on during which the student writes up their ECE 4760 project.
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    The example makes it seem like its a petitioned ENGRC 3023 (1 cred) instead of acknowledging the pre-approved existing ECE 4920 (1 cred). Specifying the course codes and in which cases they apply may make it easier for a student to determine the options available to them.
   </p>
   <p>
    Another feasible option is just to link the
    <link href="https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/students/undergraduate-students/curriculum/engineering-communications-program/technical"/>
    ECP website
    (which has better details regarding 3023 + other options) and just mention that ECE 4920 is one option commonly used by ECEs.

     When I wrote that section, I wasn't sure exactly what status the follow-on to ECE 4760 had --- for all I knew, it was another one of those petitioned add-ons.  Since then (or maybe even before then but under my radar), as you point out, ECE 4920 has become an established on-the-books course that's approved for ECP credit.  I'll figure something out.
