  I'm trying to enroll in some classes for a CS minor, but I'm running into difficulty with the waitlists. Is there a way to declare a CS minor officially to get priority placement on waitlists? I've looked online and the only CS minor form I can find is to certify completion, but not to declare that you are in the process of getting a minor.

  Check with CS on that.  I suggest contacting Nicole Roy (friend and neighbor of mine), one of the main CS undergrad advisors.
