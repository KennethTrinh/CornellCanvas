  Hi, I have a few questions regarding ENGRDs.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If I've taken ECE 2300 (which is also cross-listed as ENGRD 2300), does that also count towards the ENGRD requirement?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Also, does ENGRD 2110 count towards both the advanced programming and ENGRD requirements or does it only satisfy one?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thank you!

  ECE 2300 doesn't count as your miscellaneous ENGRD class if you're an ECE major.

  ENGRD 2110 counts as your miscellaneous ENGRD class and satisfies Advanced Programming if you're an ECE major.
