  As a senior/early MEng. ECE student, I have been taking a lot of courses in signal processing, machine learning, and the mathematical side of ECE (Markov Model, system control...). I know for sure that I am not interested in pursuing a Ph.D. degree.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I am sincerely interested in these subjects, but I am not sure what kind of career field I can enter in the future. What kind of jobs should I be looking into? What are my capabilities? I am really confused because I haven't been taking too many circuit/computer architecture courses after completing my ECE foundation course requirement. I don't know if I am eligible to apply for many of the traditional ECE jobs.

  Need MEng career advice? Contact Peter Jessel (pgj2@cornell.edu) the ECE MEng Director. He is a wealth of information on this topic.

  Since this question also pertains to the undergraduate program, I'll post my thoughts here.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The math side of electrical engineering is sometimes called Electrical Engineering:Systems, and there is a lot that one can do in the area even without a Ph.D.:
 </paragraph>

  <bold>
   Controls
  </bold>
  : Controls engineers are needed in various industries. The power grid is, basically, one massive plant that needs to be controlled. There's lots of controls in cars too---the focus used to be on controlling timing and fuel injection in internal combustion engines, but now the focus is on autonomous driving and battery management for EVs and hybrids. More ECE-relevant and more exciting, in my opinion. Controls is also a big part of aerospace, from keeping rockets pointing upright to creating autopilots for planes, drones, etc. A lot of controls engineers also end up doing robotics of some kind or another, in my experience. A lot of MAEs do controls, to be sure, but the power of control theory is that you can design controllers for plants outside your "field" as easily as you can for those in your field. I know EEs who have designed controllers for gasoline engines and MEs who work on controlling the electric power grid.

   Communications
  </bold>
  : There is plenty to do in communications, from honing 5G systems to developing the 6G standard to developing specialized communication systems for aerospace, military, and vehicular communications. When I taught ECE 4670, a lot of students went directly from the class to places like MITRE or SpaceX to work on communications with no additional training. There is also the data compression side, which is dear to my heart. Should youtube adopt the latest video compression standard? How should it transcode between different formats, resolutions, etc? How about zoom? How to compress VR information?

   Networking:
  </bold>
  Any company with a data center needs networking engineers who understand protocols to build out and optimize the data center networks. Cellular providers need to make decisions about where to place base stations, which protocols and equipment to deploy, etc. They also care about how to monitor and secure their networks. All of that work calls for an EE:Systems background. Suppliers of networking equipment need engineers who understand communication networks, not just chip designers.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <bold>
   Signal processing:
  </bold>
  Biomedical imaging is a field unto itself, and most people in the field are trained in EE:Systems. There are other biomedical applications too, such as detecting irregular cardiac activity in an implanted defibrillators. And a lot of work that people usually associate with CS, like developing ML algorithms at Facebook, can also be done by people with training in signal processing, communications, and information theory.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  There are of course also niche paths in finance and consulting too.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I think it is unfortunate that there is the widespread sense that one needs a Ph.D. to do marketable work in EE:Systems, because I don't think that is the case.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Last point, which applies in general, not just to EE:Systems: many people end up doing work that departs significantly from what they studied in school. I know analog circuits wizards, for instance, who had minimal circuits training as undergrads. They ended up learning on the job (and/or doing a bit of grad school later). At the undergrad level, becoming an expert in something basically means taking 1-2 courses in the subject. That is only 6 months to 1 year of work, which is really not very much compared to the timescale of a career. So just because you have not taken courses in circuits or architecture doesn't mean you can't move into these areas later (the same is true of course, for students who take circuits/architecture courses and then decide to move into something else).
