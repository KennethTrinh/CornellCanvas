  I know that this course was cancelled this fall due to some complications, so I was wondering if it's likely that it'll be offered next year. I'm currently trying to plan out future classes and am deciding between taking CS 2110 next semester or waiting until next fall to take ECE 2400. Thanks!

  I wish I could say yes, but as of now I don't see a path. But a lot can happen between now and August.
