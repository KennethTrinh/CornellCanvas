  Can you count credits taken during your early MEng semester toward any ECE undergraduate requirements? What about counting those credits towards minors outside of ECE?

  Yes to the first question.  Qualified Yes to the second in the sense that you're supposed to count at least some credits during that semester toward requirements you need for your "home major" (including liberal studies, etc.).  E-mail me and I can explain in more detail.

  Additional comment: sometimes setting up your Graduation Checklist for early M.Eng. entails some strategizing.

  Sorry, just to be clear. I meant to ask if you can count the same course both towards masters and undergraduate requirements. Double-counting it. Is that allowed?

  You cannot "double dip" when it comes to what courses that will count towards your Undergraduate requirements and the courses you are intending to count towards an eventual MEng degree, during an Early Admit semester.

  They are two separate things.
