 IS ECE 3150 required to be taken? or can an alternative course like 3250 or 3030 be taken in its place?

  Per the ECE Program Requirements webpage:
 </p>
 <p>
  Every ECE major must take at least three out of five ECE Foundation courses, including at least one of ECE 3030 and ECE 3150 and at least one of ECE 3100 and ECE 3250.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you choose not to take ECE 3150, you must take ECE 3030 (and vice-versa, but not exclusively e.g. you are allowed to take both).
 </p>
 <p>
  This should also be stated in your respective year's Engineering Handbook.
