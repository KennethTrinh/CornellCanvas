 What are some good CS classes 3000 or higher for CS minor that are good for ECE's?

  Hi! CS major (+ECE minor) here!
 </p>
 <p>
  I would highly recommend CS 3110. I think that 3110 makes you a better programmer. Functional programming is a different way of looking at code and concepts, and you can learn a lot from it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Additionally, OS (CS 4410) is great and counts as an ECE technical elective for ECE requirements (and I've heard the practicum, 4411 is fun), though it can be hard to get into if you're not a CS major, but I've heard that the waitlist clears most years.
 </p>
 <p>
  I also really enjoyed compilers (CS 4120/4121, you must take the course and the practicum at the same time), and taking it along with Computer Architecture (4750) really shows how almost all aspects of computers work. Fair warning though, it's a probably the most difficult course I've taken at Cornell and I'd definitely take 3110 before compilers.
 </p>

   Thanks for the response! I will be a junior next year and will be taking CS 2110 (I know it’s late but I’ve been waiting for ECE 2400 to no avail, unfortunately). I am also taking ECE Comp Arch next semester. Are there any classes that I can take concurrently with 2110? Would also love to take OS but it conflicts with Signals which is a requirement for me.

    Most CS courses will require you to have CS 2110 as a pre-requisite. CS 2800 is a good course (and is also a pre-requisite for most upper-level CS courses), so maybe you can take that concurrently. It also counts for the CS minor and I think it builds some mathematical maturity that I've used quite a bit in ECE courses
