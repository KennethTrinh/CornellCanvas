  Is HKN alive/active? If it is not, is IEEE in charge of reviving it or is it up to us students?

  My sense is that the local chapter of HKN is defunct. It is possible it is active and I'm just not aware --- if so, I hope someone from HKN will speak up.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  IEEE is an independent organization and is not responsible for anything to do with HKN (including reviving it).

  The School can provide support for reviving it, but it would need to be student led. The first step would be to identify a group of students who want to work on restarting it. I personally would love to see an active HKN chapter again.

  Ditto to Aaron Wagner.  HKN used to run tutoring sessions for 2000- and 3000-level ECE courses.  Students liked them a lot.

  I have not seen or heard anything from HKN in the last several years.
