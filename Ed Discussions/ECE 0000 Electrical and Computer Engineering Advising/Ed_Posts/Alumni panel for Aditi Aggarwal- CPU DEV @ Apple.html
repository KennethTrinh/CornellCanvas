 Hello Everyone! I'm excited to announce that IEEE will be holding an Alumni Panel with Aditi Aggarwal, an ECE alum that on the CPU development team at Apple. The event is scheduled for Monday 2/20 from 7pm-8pm on Zoom. If you have the time, this is a
 <b>
  no brainer
 </b>
 as you have the opportunity to engage with someone working in one the most notable industries in the world on the forefront of cutting edge technology. In order to attend this event, we simply ask that you fill out our rsvp form (so we can get a general headcount) and come prepared with questions. We are so excited to see you there!
