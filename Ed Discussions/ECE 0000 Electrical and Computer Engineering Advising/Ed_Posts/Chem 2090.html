 Is chem 2090 the only chemistry requirement necessary for graudation and engineering? Or is chem 2090 + chem 2080 necessary?

  CHEM 2090 is an Engineering requirement.
  <break>
  </break>
  CHEM 2080 may or may not be required (or recommended) based on your major.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some others majors (such as CS, IS, CivE, EAS, ORIE) have an elective spot that must be filled by an additional chemistry, physics, economics, and/or mathematics course. (The exact courses that may fulfill each are listed on the Engineering Handbook.)
 </p>
 <p>
  If your major does not strictly require CHEM 2080 (like ECE), you are still allowed to take it and can usually fulfill some sort of Technical Elective requirements (but most ECEs do not take CHEM 2080).
 </p>
 <p>
  Please consult your year's Engineering Handbook as the requirements are broken down quite nicely in the footnotes for each major.
