 I saw on the ECE MEng website that we need 4 approved ECE core courses for MEng, but I can't find the list of courses. Where can I find this list of courses or is it just all 5000+ ECE courses?

  If you go to the MEng degree requirements page
  <a href="https://www.ece.cornell.edu/ece/programs/graduate-programs/meng-program/meng-degree-requirements">
   https://www.ece.cornell.edu/ece/programs/graduate-programs/meng-program/meng-degree-requirements
   , at the bottom it states, "To receive the most recently updated version of either the Core Course List or Tech Electives List, please contact Scott Coldren directly at
   <link href="mailto:sec36@cornell.edu?subject=CORE%20COURSE%2FTECHNICAL%20ELECTIVES%20LIST"/>
   sec36@cornell.edu
  </a>
  ."

  Please email me directly and I'd be happy to share this information with you.

   I suggest talking to Scott Coldren or Prof. Jessel. This Ed Discussion (at least as of now) is for the undergraduate program.
