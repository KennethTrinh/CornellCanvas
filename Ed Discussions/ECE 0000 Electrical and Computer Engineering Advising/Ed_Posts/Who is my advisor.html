  I sent the affiliation form in Fall 2021, and got confirmation from Professor Delchamps that my affiliation is approved. However, my advisor in student center is still my advisor from freshman year who is not an ECE professor. Is there a mistake on student center for me?

  I'll check into this.  It should be me if it's not another ECE faculty member.

  Short story: your advisor assignment got lost in the confusion last fall when Charlene was out.

  I'll have Devan switch your advisor to me so you at least have someone in ECE to consult.  I notice that you didn't express an advisor preference from the menu I sent you originally,  If you'd like me to re-send that, let me know and I will!
