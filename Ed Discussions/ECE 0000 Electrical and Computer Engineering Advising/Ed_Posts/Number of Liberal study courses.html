 Hi, I remember reading a post that we are allowed to have more than 6 liberal courses to meet the 18 credits requirement. But I can't find that post anymore. So I am wondering whether or not we can take more than 6 courses in liberal studies to meet the 18 credits requirement? (I took a 2 credits course which means I would need to take some 4 credits liberal, but I was thinking of taking an additional liberal study course.)

  Page 18 of the engineering handbook says that the liberal studies requirement is "At least six courses (totaling at least 18 credits)," so you can take more than 6 courses to hit the 18 credits.
