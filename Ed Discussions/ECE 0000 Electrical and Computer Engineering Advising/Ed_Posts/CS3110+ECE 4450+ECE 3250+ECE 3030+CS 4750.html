 I wonder how is the workload manageable if I take CS3110+ECE 4450+ECE 3250+ECE 3030+CS 4750 in the same semester; For comparison, I am taking ECE2300, ECE3100, CS2800, ECE2720, SOC2100 this semester and feels pretty busy but still doable. (BTW, in this plan, I'll have to be absent from all discussion sessions of ECE3030 and ECE3250, and I heard they're actually extra lectures)
</p>
<p>
 I heard CS3110 has a relatively heavy workload, but how heavy it is?

  CS 4750 - great class, can be a lot of work, especially for later assignments
 </p>
 <p>
  ECE 3030 - I enjoyed this class and it has a good amount of work
 </p>
 <p>
  This could be doable if you have no extra responsibilities - but if you are applying for internships and are part of other activities, it will become very busy

   Why do you plan to miss the discussions? You will be missing 1/3 of the content of those courses. You can get the notes from other people or learn the topics on your own, but it seems a disservice to yourself to just skip those classes.

   I'll leave it to someone else to comment on the CS courses, but I can concur that this schedule seems busy but doable.

    +1 on missing discussions. Relatedly, studentcenter won't let you enroll in classes with conflicting schedules. You'll have to petition to add such classes. Those petitions are handled by higher ups, not ECE, and they are usually denied unless there is a compelling for enrolling in conflicting courses, such as that you won't graduate otherwise.
