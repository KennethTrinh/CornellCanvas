  Do petitions happen before or after pre-enroll? If they happen after pre-enroll, would it be more strategic to enroll into classes that are harder to get into and petition a class that's easier to get into? Are we more likely to get our petition passed if we're only going over by one credit?

  All the petitions I've seen so far have happened after pre-enroll --- the engineering college can't make the system recognize an approved petition and allow a student to pre-enroll over the limit.  Yes to both of your Yes/No questions.
