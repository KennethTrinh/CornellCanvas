 Hello! I am double majoring in ECE and CS and did not realize that I have to enroll in the cross listed courses as CS to be able to count it. How do i switch the course code? Thank you!

  It's never too late to change the registration.  You need to fill out a College of Engineering petition.

   If you've already finished the course it's probably too late to change it in your transcript - maybe email Nicole Roy or Ryan Marchenese to see if they can make an exception?

   Otherwise if you haven't taken the course yet you can just switch during add/drop in the spring
