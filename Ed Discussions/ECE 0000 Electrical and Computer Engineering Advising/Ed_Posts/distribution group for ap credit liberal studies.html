  If they give you a specific Cornell course for the AP on your unofficial transcript, that course's distribution group is the one you're looking for.   Otherwise, you can probably figure it out, but I can help if you have trouble with a particular AP.

   they're listed with a course code but it doesn't match with a real class in the lib studies lookup page, for example.

   i have english (ENGL1102A) and spanish (SPAN1100C). im assuming they would be groups 5 and 1, respectively, but want to make sure because the lib studies i'm planning to take here are mostly the same group (not the same group as these are).

    Those would be LA and FL, respectively --- I don't know the numbers by heart.
