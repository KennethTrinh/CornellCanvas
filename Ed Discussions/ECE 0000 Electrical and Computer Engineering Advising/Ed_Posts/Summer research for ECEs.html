 Is it possible for undergraduate ECEs to get research experience in ECE at Cornell over the summer? It's okay if things like housing stipends can't be covered, I'm interested in getting the experience.

  Absolutely possible.  Your best strategy is to contact individual faculty members whose research appeals to you.  I think you can do it for pay XOR for academic credit.
