 Just to clarify - If I complete the following courses - MATH 2930, PHYS 2213, and and one of ECE 2100, ECE 2720 or ECE 2300 by the end of this semester and score at least C+, I can affiliate with the ECE major?

  One more wrinkle: you need a 2.5 GPA across a list of courses including those above --- for the list, see:

  Furthermore, the C+ thing has nuances --- you need a C+ in MATH 2930, PHYS 2213, and
  <i>
   at least one of
  </i>
  the ECE 2000-level required courses.
