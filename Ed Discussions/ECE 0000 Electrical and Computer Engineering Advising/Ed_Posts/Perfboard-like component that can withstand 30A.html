 I'm using a relay to open or close a 30A, 36V path, while the relay itself is driven by a microcontroller with logic high 3.3V and 25mA. I'm using a perfboard and want to keep the LV and HV path separate, but don't know where to put

 relay. I'm against a timeline so was thinking of soldering the 30A wires and the relay's appropriate pin to a separate perfboard-like component that can withstand 30A - the one I have right now can for sure not do that.

 I'm wondering if this component exists or if someone has advice on how to deal with this relay.

 Thanks.
