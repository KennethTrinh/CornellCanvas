  I'm pretty sure you're almost always allowed to count anything towards two separate programs (like majors or minors).

 <paragraph>
  For example, if you're double majoring in ECE and CS, there's no reason why OS wouldn't fulfill an ECE elective and also your CS requirement at the same time.

  I think rare exceptions might be between undergraduate and graduate degrees or maybe some minors that are more specific about their restrictions.

  I know the robotics minor has some rules of the form, "A student in Major A can't count Course X toward the robotics minor."
