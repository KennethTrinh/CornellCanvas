 Is it possible to count CS 4410 as a ECE Upper-Level elective and also count it towards the CS minor?

  I'm pretty sure you're almost always allowed to count anything towards two separate programs (like majors or minors).
 </p>
 <p>
  For example, if you're double majoring in ECE and CS, there's no reason why OS wouldn't fulfill an ECE elective and also your CS requirement at the same time.
 </p>
 <p>
  I think rare exceptions might be between undergraduate and graduate degrees or maybe some minors that are more specific about their restrictions.

   I know the robotics minor has some rules of the form, "A student in Major A can't count Course X toward the robotics minor."
