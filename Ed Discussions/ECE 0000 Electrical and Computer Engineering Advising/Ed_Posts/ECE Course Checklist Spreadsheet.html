  Do we have to submit the ECE course checklist spreadsheet before the end of the semester even though I won't have any of the final grades for my courses? Or, as a follow-up, do we even have to submit the checklist spreadsheet?

  Please do submit your filled-out ECE Graduation Checklist without your Spring 2022 grades.  You'll have to submit the Checklist eventually, but clearing you for graduation will be easier for ECE if you submit it soon.
