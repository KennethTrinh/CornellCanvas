 I am in the situation where I am saving one course to take during my early admit semester to the M. Eng program which allows me to have a very light semester this spring. In order to stay in good academic standing, the website says I have to "achieve a passing grade in at least 12 credit-hours' worth of course work". Does this count PE classes? What about UNILWYL classes? I only have 11 credits worth of courses contributing toward my graduation requirement and would like to know of any restrictions on the last course I choose.

  If you look at the relevant part of the Engineering Handbook (page 150 in the Fall '21 edition), it just says a passing grade in $\geq 12$ credits for ECE majors, while other majors note explicit restrictions, such as the Independent Major excluding PE and courses numbered below 1100. The criterion for unaffiliated students list similar exclusions. So as long as you pass &gt;= 12 credits of any kind, no problem.

  The spirit of this rule is that we want students to make progress toward graduation each semester. So if graduation is clearly in the bag, this isn't a big concern as far as ECE goes. There can be non-academic ramifications to carrying a light load of courses, however, involving financial aid and health insurance. That's not something we can speak to.

   PE classes definitely count, I'm not sure about UNILWYL.
