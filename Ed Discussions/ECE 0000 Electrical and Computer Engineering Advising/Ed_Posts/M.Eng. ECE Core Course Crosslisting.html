 I am currently enrolled in SYSEN 5200 as an M.Eng. student and it is crosslisted as ECE 5130 (which counts as a ECE Core Course per Scott Coldren).
</p>
<p>
 Do I need to switch over to ECE 5130 (I would need a permission code), or is SYSEN 5200 sufficient for meeting graduation requirements?  The enrollment for ECE 5130 is suspiciously at 0 right now.
</p>

  I'm sorry, but Aaron is incorrect about this.

  If you want a course to count as an ECE Core Course, you have to be enrolled in the ECE version of it - not the cross-listed version. So no, if you're currently enrolled in the SYS ENG version of the course, you need to correct this or it won't count.

  You should also be contacting me directly instead of just posting here.

   Sorry --- I did not realize this. This is something I think we should look into changing for the future, but for now Anonymous will need to switch to the ECE version.

   I guess this is a reason to restrict the discussion here to undergrad matters only, which Prof. Delchamps and I are better versed in.

   EDIT: See Scott's reply.

   (Also, for the record this Canvas course is devoted to the undergraduate program.)

    Thanks for the heads up, I just finished UG here a month ago - is there an Ed devoted to grad students?

     ECE doesn't have an Ed for grad stuff (yet), but sometimes the folks monitoring this page know answers to M.Eng. questions.
