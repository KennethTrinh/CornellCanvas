  I was told when I took Navs 1101 that it could be counted as a liberal studies, but when I went to check on
  <link href="https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/FA22"/>
  class roster, it didn't appear to have a category associated with it.

  Does this mean there is no way to count it towards my liberal studies requirement?

  If there is, what category would it fall under? If not, could I count it as an advisor-approved elective?

  I suggest you pose your question to Engineering Advising --- the engineering college oversees the LS requirement.  I found NAVS 1102 on a list of approved courses, but I couldn't find NAVS 1101, much less  a LS caetgory.
