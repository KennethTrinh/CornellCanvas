 I was told when I took Navs 1101 that it could be counted as a liberal studies, but when I went to check on
 <a href="https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/FA22">
  class roster
 </a>
 , it didn't appear to have a category associated with it.

<p>
 Does this mean there is no way to count it towards my liberal studies requirement?
</p>
<p>
 If there is, what category would it fall under? If not, could I count it as an advisor-approved elective?

  I suggest you pose your question to Engineering Advising --- the engineering college oversees the LS requirement.  I found NAVS 1102 on a list of approved courses, but I couldn't find NAVS 1101, much less  a LS caetgory.
