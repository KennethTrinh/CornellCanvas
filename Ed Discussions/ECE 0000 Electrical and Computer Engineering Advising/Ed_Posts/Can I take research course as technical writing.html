  Dr. Rick Evans, head of the Engineering Communications Program, has the last word on all petitions to satisfy the technical-writing requirement in unconventional ways.  I'm pretty sure that students in the past have used writing associated with undergrad research to cover the requirement.  If you're interested in such an arrangement, I recommend you consult Rick Evans ahead of time to get it pre-approved.
