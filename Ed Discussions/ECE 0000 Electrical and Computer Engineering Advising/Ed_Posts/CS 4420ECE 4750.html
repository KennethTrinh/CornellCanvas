 Would taking ECE 4750 as CS 4420 count as part of the Outside Technical Elective requirement. (The one that requires you to take a class above 3000+ level)

  The course's home department is ECE, so no --- but if you have one 3000+ ECE Elective course that we could retro-interpret as "outside your major disciplinary area" in ECE, you can count it toward OTE.  If you tell me what other 3000+ Electives you're planning to take, I might be able to make suggestions.

   Ok thanks for the note. Do you mean that if I'm specializing more on the analog side of ECE and decide to take a class like Microcontrollers, 4760, it could count as an OTE?

    Yeah, something like that --- although you usually don't want to "waste" a CDE on OTE.
