  Yes in the sense that it is possible to reterm "backwards" in addition to forwards. This happens, for instance, whenever unaffiliated students have a rough semester and get placed on a required leave of absence by the College to sort things out. Their term is ticked backwards by one semester, which gives them more time to affiliate.

  If a student reterms to be a senior, and it turns out this was an error and they actually aren't expecting to graduate by the end of the next semester, we can certainly reterm them back to a junior. But in both directions, the reterming should reflect a genuine belief by everyone involved that the student's term doesn't actually reflect their expected graduation. Attempting to reterm with the intent of backtracking shortly afterwards is not appreciated.
