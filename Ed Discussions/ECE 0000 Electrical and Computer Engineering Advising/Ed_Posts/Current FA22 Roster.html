  Hi everyone,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I thought we'd try an experiment for this year's pre-enroll. I've posted below the ECE roster that we use internally, which is generated using an ECE-produced script from the University's master database. It organizes useful information about the ECE courses in one table. It also computes scheduling conflicts and notes them in the last column.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I hope you find this roster useful for your course planning. I personally went through it looking for problematic conflicts, as did some of the instructors. But it is possible we missed something. Let me know if you spot a conflict that you think merits moving a course, bearing in mind that we cannot avoid all conflicts. It is officially past the deadline for us to move courses, but I'm sure we can do so if a serious conflict is spotted.

  A few other miscellaneous notes about Fall 2022:
 </paragraph>
 <list style="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    With the elimination of ECE 2200, ECE 3250 will become a stand-alone signals and systems course starting this Fall. So the Fall 2022 version will not have ECE 2200 as a prereq. In fact, starting Fall 2022, ECE 2200 will not be listed as a prereq for anything.
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    As noted in recent postings, ECE 4250 is being offered in the Fall but it is losing its CDE status.
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    I'm hoping to get some additional signals-type courses added to the list of CDEs, but I can't promise anything yet. The plan is to offer ECE 4670 as a CDE in Spring 2023 as usual.
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    ECE 4200 and ECE 4740 are both courses that have been offered during the Fall during some past years that we are planning to offer Spring 2023 instead of Fall 2022.

  Any hope for an overlap approval for 3250 + 4560? Both offer only a single discussion section which is held Wednesdays from 130-220pm.

  As ECE 3250 instructor, I routinely approve students' requests for enrollments that conflict with the Wednesday class, which is actually an additional lecture rather than a discussion section.  Students can easily get notes from someone else.  The college's draconian new attitude toward enrollment-with-conflicts has prompted me to come up with a work-around that I haven't yet had to implement.  Note: the other course's instructor also needs to support the conflict enrollment.

  Overlap approvals are done by the College of Engineering. You are welcome to try, but my understanding is that they are approving them only in extreme cases now, like when a student needs both courses to graduate.

  "In fact, starting Fall 2022, ECE 2200 will not be listed as a prereq for anything."
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  On the released course roster, DSP still lists 2200 as a pre-req and as a CDE.

  EDIT: Nevermind. "Course information provided by the Courses of Study 2021-2022. Courses of Study 2022-2023 is scheduled to publish mid-June."

  I find it surprising that they publish the roster before the catalog rather than the other way around. With the current system, students pre-enroll in courses without entirely knowing what they are signing up for. I'm sure there is a reason they do it this way, but it feels a bit out-of-order.

  And don't forget ... ECE 2400 is a great choice for your second ENGRD ;)

  Would it be at all possible to move the time for ECE 2100? As of right now, it (sole lecture times) conflicts with PHYS 2218 (Honors Waves). Personally, I know a handful of people, including myself, who are either forced to take the non-honors version of waves or delay taking ECE 2100 to accommodate this conflict. Seeing that ECE 2100 is a prerequisite for many higher-level ECE classes, I was wondering if this conflict could somehow be resolved.

  No, unfortunately. The roster is built around the core 2000- and 3000-level courses. Moving one of them inevitably has knock-on effects. And new conflicts with non-ECE courses are possible, even likely.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I should point out that ECE 2100, 2300, and 2720 are offered every semester and can be taken in any order.

  ECE 5330 and 4060 seem to overlap in lecture times and they're both being taught by Prof. Rana. Is this a mistake?

  No. They are two versions (undergrad and grad) of the same course. They have the same meeting patterns and are taught by the same instructor, but the expectations for students in the grad version are higher. Students in the grad version are usually responsible for more material, have extra assignments or more advanced problems to complete, etc.

  There are actually several examples of this (e.g., 4110/5110) in the roster. Undergrads should enroll in the 4000-level version in most cases.

  Could the file be regenerated? It seems like some course times / info were updated. (So happy that 4360 is no longer at 8am)

  Updated. The ECE 4360 move is the only real change I know of.  I wish I could take credit for making you happy but both the original meeting time and the change were driven by MSE's needs.
