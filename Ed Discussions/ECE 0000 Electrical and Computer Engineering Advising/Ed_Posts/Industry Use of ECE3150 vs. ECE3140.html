  Hey everyone. I am currently setting up my ECE schedule for next semester and, it seems like I am stuck in the loop of having to take ECE 3140 and/or 3150 next semester. They seem to go in two completely different pathways of ECE, but I am not sure if it is so from the industry perspectives point of view. Individually, both of the courses seem very interesting to me, and I also heard that for many ECE's Embedded Systems was the defining courses in their respective colleges.

 <paragraph>
  I would greatly appreciate if anyone who took one or both of these courses could give an insight on how these courses were useful to them post grad or while at Cornell.

 <paragraph>
  On a side note, do you think Data Science + Embedded + Microelectronics is a doable schedule workload wise or am I just highly delusional about these three courses?

  Pretty common combination of courses for an advanced sophomore. I think they're reasonable to take together as well. 3150 is basically a circuits course, so you'll be learning about transistors and semiconductor theory and whatnot. It has interesting applications to digital logic as well, which could be useful if you want to take courses in VLSI.

  3140 is the standard computer engineering course for systems-level programming. If you want to pursue more computer engineering related things, you should definitely take it, as many of the upper level courses in computer architecture rely on it.

  How useful these courses are will vary a lot depending on your job... If you go into architecture 3150 might not be that useful. Conversely, if you stay in circuits-work it'll be much more useful.

  1) I took that exact workload, along with a project team and research, and it was doable for me - others may have a different experience

  2) I would say both are very useful, and I am glad I took them. They are both "intermediate" courses for their respective tracks (computer engineering and circuit design). I also found that they helped a lot with topics outside of what you'd expect, and gave you different perspectives than you might expect. 3150 is on transistor physics and amplifier design, but has applications to digital logic in the sense of how gates are designed. 3140 is focused on using embedded systems, specifically focusing on scheduling, and gives a more bare-metal approach/

  light intro to how you might go about designing an OS. They are both helpful in giving different perspectives on what you might be taught elsewhere, and I was surprised at their applicability
