  For the time conflict form it says, "Fall 2022 submissions will not be accepted until the add/drop period begins in mid-August." Does it matter what day we submit it, whether it be the day for seniors, juniors, etc.? Does it have to be the day our particular add/drop period starts?

  As far as I know, it doesn't matter.

  I agree that it probably doesn't matter. I forwarded your question to the College of Engineering, which handles these requests. I'll let you know if they say otherwise. Hopefully they will also clarify the form.

  Update: the College said they "... removed the sentence from the website now which should eliminate the confusion."

  FYI, they discourage students from submitting the form during pre-enroll because (1) they have found that a lot of students change their minds about enrolling in conflicting courses in the interregnum, and (2) once the registrar adds the conflicting courses, it prevents you from making any further changes to your schedule yourself, because your "new" schedule will always be flagged as invalid by the system. So you either need to ask them to make changes for you, or you need to drop one of the courses with the conflict, make the change you want, and then petition to take conflicting courses all over again.
