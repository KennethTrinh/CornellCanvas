  I'm a little confused about whether ECE 3400 is a required course at the moment. I was under the impression that it wasn't initially since I never came across it marked as required in the handbook. However, looking at the Fall 2020 handbook now, I see it has been designated as a required course. I don't see this reflected on the website, and was wondering if it applies to those who entered in Fall 2020.

  It was required as of Fall 2020. The requirement was eliminated in Spring 2021 and replaced with a requirement that you take one additional 3000+ ECE elective. Since 3400 is an 3000+ ECE course, a checklist that satisfies the old requirements satisfies the new ones. So we don't need to even refer to the old requirements anymore, since anyone who follows the handbook from 2020 or before will graduate all the same.

  All right, so can I take a different 4000 level course in place of ECE 3400 as a 3000+ ECE course? Or would I need to necessarily take ECE 3400 if I entered Fall 2020?

  The requirement was eliminated in Spring 2021 for everyone.

  You can always choose to whether to graduate under the requirements in effect when you matriculated or that came into effect subsequently, subject to rare exceptions having to do with students who go on leave for an extended period.
