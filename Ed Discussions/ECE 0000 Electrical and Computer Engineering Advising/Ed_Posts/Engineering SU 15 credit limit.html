  The engineering handbook says we can’t take more than 15 credits of S/U options for undergraduate graduation. I wonder if AP credits count toward this limit. On my transcript, one course, for example, Physics 1112 is labeled as ‘S’ because I used my AP credits.

  AP doesn't count toward that limit.  FWIW I didn't know such a limit even existed!
