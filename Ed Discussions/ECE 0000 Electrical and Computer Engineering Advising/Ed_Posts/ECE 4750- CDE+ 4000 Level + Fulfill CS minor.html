 Hello, I noticed that Computer Architecture is listed as a CS course equivalent as well as the traditional ECE course numbering. Can it be counted both as a CDE and outside Tech Elective?

  CS 4420's home department is ECE, so if you wanted to use it as OTE instead of (CDE XOR 4000+ ECE Elective), it would need to fall outside your major disciplinary area, which it probably doesn't because you're minoring in CS.

   You may count a course towards both the ECE major and the CS minor. (If you wish it to count towards the CS minor, you
   <b>
    must
   </b>
   enroll as CS 4420 and
   <b>
    not
   </b>
   ECE 4750.)
  </p>
  <p>
   But
   <b>
    within
   </b>
   the ECE major, you cannot count one course as two different categories. You must pick one.

   (Imagine filling out one of the
   <a href="https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/content/image-listing-item/image/Electrical%20and%20Computer%20Engineering_0.jpg">
    bubbles
    with "ECE 4750 / CS 4420")

   Technically, you should be able to use CS 4420 as an OTE. Whether or not it would count towards following rule (listed on the
   <link href="https://www.ece.cornell.edu/ece/programs/undergraduate-programs/majors/program-requirements"/>
   ECE Program Requirements
   website) is more of a Prof. Delchamps matter:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   One additional option exists for ECE students. A student may, with advisor approval, count one advanced ECE course as an Outside-ECE Technical Elective provided that the course's subject matter lies outside the student's major disciplinary area as determined by the focus of the student's upper-level ECE course work.
