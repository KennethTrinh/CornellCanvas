  Got this today from Dr.Allison Hutchinson from the Engineering Communications Program:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Greetings, everyone,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I am contacting engineering advisors, especially those in ECE and CS, with information for your senior advisees who may be interested in ENGRC 3025: Creating and Communicating Your Digital Professionalism. Ever since this course's initial offering, it has become popular with ECE and CS majors for fulfilling the
  <link href="https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/students/undergraduate-students/curriculum/engineering-communications-program/technical"/>
  Engineering Communications Requirement. As a result, we plan to offer two sections of the course in the Fall 2022 semester. The course description and enrollment information are available on the
  <link href="https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/FA22/class/ENGRC/3025"/>
  class roster.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  In order to register during pre-enroll, students must confirm that they meet the prerequisites* by filling out the
  <link href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSebEBovtwjindkALZgLPmHDMmo9xp6lGTVCt1lxue8YCmmVIA/viewform?usp=sf_link"/>
  enrollment request form. Students can also find the link to this form in the syllabi linked on the class roster. I will contact students directly who meet the prerequisites with a PIN for enrolling during their assigned pre-enrollment slot.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If you have any questions about the course or the enrollment process, please let me know. We appreciate you sharing this information with the students you advise. Please forward this email to anyone I may have missed or who you believe would benefit from this information.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Many thanks,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Allison

  I recommend emailing Dr. Hutchinson. She is not on this Ed Discussion so she won't see your post.

  Request to either update the enrollment request links with the SP23 ones (as in the email sent out to seniors on 10/21) or to make a new pinned post with the updated information?
