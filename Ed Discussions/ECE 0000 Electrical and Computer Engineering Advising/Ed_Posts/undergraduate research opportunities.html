 I was wondering if ECE undergrads could get research experience in research groups like CSL or FIND?  It seems on the websites that they are for graduate students only?

  Definitely. I suggest reaching out to individual professors within CSL or FIND. The websites are useful to help you (and Ph.D. students) identify which faculty work in a given area. Ph.D. students also work with individual professors rather than working within CSL or FIND more broadly. The webpages are targeted to Ph.D. students because Ph.D. students come here mainly to do research.
