  We are aware that ECE 4320 and ECE 4271 are full and ECE 3100 is mostly full. We are raising the cap for 4320 and adding another discussion section to 3100 (which will allow us to raise the overall cap). We are looking into the possibility of raising the 4271 cap.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If you have opinions on when the extra 3100 discussion should meet, let me know in the comments. It will need to be on Thursday or Friday.

  It would be great if the extra discussion session for ECE 3100 is on Friday, any time between 11am to 2:30pm

  Will the 4320 cap be raised by the end of today or during normal enrollment?

  We are trying to make all changes ASAP. But we can only submit a request to the registrar to change it, and then they have to actually change it, and then an overnight period is required for all databases to sync. For 4320, I submitted the request yesterday.

  I personally question why the pre-enroll windows are so short, as it doesn't give us time to react.

  Thanks, everyone. An additional 3100 section on Fridays from 11:20-12:10 is in the works. Also an additional discussion for 2720 (which is now also full) from 3:45-4:35 on Thursdays. Various other classes have also filled up that we are looking at.
