  In the requirements, it says two courses must be 2000 level or above but doesn't say how many credits they need to be. If I took two 1 credit liberal studies of the 2000 level, would that still count?

  That's borderline but seems to satisfy the rules at least technically.  I suggest checking with Engineering Advising --- liberal studies is a college requirement, not an ECE requirement.  FWIW I think I've seen students do it with fewer than 6 total 2000+ credits, but I don't recall having seen someone do it with just 2.
