 I'm looking to take STSCI 5100 as an MEng tech elective, but I'm not sure if it counts as a 5000-level course in engineering. The class roster categorizes STSCI classes as Engineering, but the department website says it's part of CIS, CALC, and ILR. Does being part of CIS make it part of Engineering too?

  Yes, STSCI 5100 will count as an MEng Tech Elective.

  This field is part of the College of Engineering.

   CIS isn't "part of engineering," but STSCI 5100 is definitely a 5000-level technical course.  An ECE undergrad, for example, could count it as an Outside-ECE Technical Elective.  I'm not sure whether the M.Eng. rules require all M.Eng. technical courses to be "in engineering," but I'd imagine not --- that would rule out math and physics courses, for example, and probably some CS.
