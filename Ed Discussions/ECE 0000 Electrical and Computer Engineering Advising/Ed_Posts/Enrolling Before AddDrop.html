 Hi, I recently changed my mind about taking a class because it fits better with my long-term schedule. With pre-enroll being over, I was wondering if it was still at all possible to add/replace a class before the official add/drop period at the start of Fall '22?

  I think not, but check for confirmation with the engineering registrar.
