 In order to satisfy the technical writing requirement, is there a list of writing-Intensive courses (non-ENGRC) under ECE or CS? I think there are some courses listed on the website, but I don't think they are updated.

  ECE has a couple of courses that cover technical writing (e.g. ECE 3600), but the only list of so-called writing-intensive courses I know of is in
  <i>
   Courses of Study
  </i>
  about a quarter of the way down this page:
