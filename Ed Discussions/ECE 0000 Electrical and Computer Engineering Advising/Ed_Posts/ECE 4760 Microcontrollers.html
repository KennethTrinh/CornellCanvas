  Is there any chance the microcontrollers class will switch from PIC32 microcontrollers to ARM when it's offered in the fall? I've heard rumors and am hopeful this is the case, since ARM seems to be much more prevalent in industry

  99% sure he is switching to the Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040). It is an ARM Cortex-M0+ processor.
