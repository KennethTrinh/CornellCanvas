  I saw an earlier post about how certain crosslisted ECE courses cannot count as OTEs. What is the exact rule on that?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For example could I take the following three courses to satisfy my 9 OTE credits

  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    ECE3140/CS3420
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    ECE4870/EAS4870
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    ECE4320/MAE4320
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>

  No exact rule exists, but in practice the way it works is that you can use one course toward OTE whose "home department" is ECE as long as it's outside your major disciplinary area (easy to retro-fit), and you can use toward OTE any course whose "home department" is not ECE .  For your specific question, ECE is the home department of both ECE 3140 and ECE 4320 , whereas EAS is the home department of ECE 4370.  Thus you could use ECE 4870 toward OTE with no questions asked, but you'd probably have to pick one of the other two courses to use as your single allowed "ECE course" toward OTE.

  Is this confusing enough?  :-)

  Can a course count as both an OTE and upper-level elective, such as ECE/MAE 4320?

  Not simultaneously --- like, ECE 4320 can count as OTE XOR Upper-level Elective on a given Graduation Checklist.
