 Hi! I was looking at the class roster and saw the class ECE 4230 - Computer vision. There's no description available that I could find so I was wondering if someone could give me a quick synopsis of what the class is about. Thanks!

  Here is the course website for ECE 4230 / 5470: https://www.via.cornell.edu/ece5470/

  The 4000s level code was just added in FA22, so you will find most information by searching for the 5000s level code.
