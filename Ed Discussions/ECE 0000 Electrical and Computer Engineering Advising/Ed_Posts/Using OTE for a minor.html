 So far, I have taken 2 CS courses as my OTE. Can I use these classes to qualify as an OTE while still being able to obtain a CS minor?

  ECE does not care if you also count major courses towards a minor. In some cases, the department offering a minor may not allow you to double count, but CS does not care either. The only thing CS wants is for you to take the CS version of the class if it is cross-listed.
