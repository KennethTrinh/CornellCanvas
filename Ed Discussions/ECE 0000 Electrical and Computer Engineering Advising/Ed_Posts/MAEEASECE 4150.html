  What is the home department of MAE/EAS/ECE 4150 (GPS: Theory and Design)?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I know it is taught by Prof. David Hysell in EAS but I am unsure if that means it belongs to EAS or if it technically lives in another department (for counting towards OTE).

  The home is actually MAE. The way to tell is to look at which version has a full catalog description at courses.cornell.edu. MAE 4150 has a full description, while the ECE 4150 entry just says "For description and learning outcomes, see
  <link href="https://courses.cornell.edu/content.php?filter%5B27%5D=ECE&amp;filter%5B29%5D=&amp;filter%5Bcourse_type%5D=-1&amp;filter%5Bkeyword%5D=&amp;filter%5B32%5D=1&amp;filter%5Bcpage%5D=1&amp;cur_cat_oid=45&amp;expand=&amp;navoid=18032&amp;search_database=Filter#tt5451"/>
  MAE 4150."

  In my view, since no ECE faculty member has taught the course for at least ten years, you're free to count it as OTE without counting it as your "one allowed ECE course among OTE."
