  I noticed the website says the 6 ECE electives are required, but in the engineering handbook (for students entering in Fall 2019) ECE major checklist, only 5 ECE electives are listed. Also the checklist (Excel) I got at affiliation also lists only 5 ECE electives. I'm not sure which one should I follow.

  For students graduating in Dec. 2021 or later, ECE 3400 was made optional and the required number of ECE 3000+ electives was increased by one (the required number of elective credits was increased as well). This was reflected in the 2021 handbook. As a general matter, you always have the option of meeting the graduation requirements in effect when you entered (with some rare exceptions, mainly having to do with students that matriculate, then go on leave for a long period, then come back). In your case, the change is  backward compatible in that you can count ECE 3400 as your 6th ECE elective. So meeting the old requirements also meets the new ones.
