 Was wondering if the cap would be increased before tomorrow's add/drop period. Thanks!

  No, inasmuch as we will need to find a bigger room, and that usually takes more than a day.

   Actually, I just communicated with the instructor, and she is maintaining a waitlist and adding people manually. The plan is not to raise the cap. I suggest reaching out to her.
