 How long does a graduation checklist audit usually take? I submitted mine for audit approximately 1.5 to 2 weeks ago and wanted to know if I should continue to wait or a follow-up would be needed.

   Shouldn't take that long.  Unfortunately Devan and Sharif are out tomorrow.  Send it to me in the meantime and I'll take a look.
