 I know similar questions have been asked but I wanted to confirm that even if I take embedded systems as CS 3420, I can still count it towards my ECE requirements. Thank you!

   Yep - ECE doesn't care which version of cross-listed courses you take as long as they are listed as ECE in some capacity
