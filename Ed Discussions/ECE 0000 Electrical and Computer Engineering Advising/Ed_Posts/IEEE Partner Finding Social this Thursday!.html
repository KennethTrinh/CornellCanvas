 From our friends in IEEE:
</p>
<p>
 Are you trying to make friends in your ECE classes? Are you trying to find a lab partner? Do you want to meet more ECE majors in general? Do you like free food?
</p>
<p>
 If you said yes to any of those questions, then IEEE has the perfect event for you! Join us this Thursday at 5 pm at the ECE Undergrad Lounge for a Partner Finding Social. Come and mingle with us and other ECEs!
</p>
<p>
 It's going to be a great time. Can't wait to see you there!
