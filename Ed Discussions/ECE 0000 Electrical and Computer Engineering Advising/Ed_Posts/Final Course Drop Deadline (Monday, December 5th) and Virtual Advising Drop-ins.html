  Last Day to Drop a Course – Monday, December 5
  <sup>

  </sup>

</p>
<p>
 If you wish to drop a course, it will be necessary to submit a completed
 <a href="https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/departments/EN%20Registrar/General%20Petition%20and%20Add-Drop%20Form.pdf">
  <i>
   <underline>
    General Petition with Add/Drop Form

  </i>
  (
  <b>
   you cannot drop yourself from a course on Student Center
  </b>
  ). The Add/Drop portion of the form must be stamped/initialed by the department that offers the course and the General Petition portion of the form must be signed by your faculty advisor—
  <b>
   therefore it is important that you give yourself enough time to procure the stamp and signatures by the deadline. Submit the
   <i>
    General Petition with Add/Drop Form
   </i>
   to the Engineering Registrar’s Office via email at eng_registrar@cornell.edu.

  Academic Advising

<p>
 <b>
  It will be important for you to consult with your faculty advisor, Engineering Advising, and/or your major coordinator (if you are affiliated) before you drop a course.
 </b>
 Please note that a “W” will appear on your transcript next to the course. A grade of “W” does not impact your Cornell GPA. Dropping a course may have other repercussions such as falling below 12 credits, violating good standing criteria, staying on track for affiliation/major course sequencing, etc.

     All undergraduate students are expected to maintain 12 credits per semester. Undergraduate students are essentially considered full-time (there is no part-time status in the College of Engineering at the undergraduate level). When an engineering student falls below 12 credits for a semester, it is their choice, and they are considered under hours. There is no petition to take less than 12 credits in the College of Engineering and we don’t approve or disapprove of this. Students will want to confirm with the following to determine if less than 12 credits will be impactful:

  No Extensions to the Drop Deadline
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 Since the absolute last day to drop a course falls on the last day of classes for this term,
 <b>
  there are no extensions to drop
 </b>
 . At that point, students should have enough information about their current status in courses to make a decision to drop.
