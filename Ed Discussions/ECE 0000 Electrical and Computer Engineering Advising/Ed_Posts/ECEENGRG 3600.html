 On the Course Roster, ECE 3600 has a note saying "ECE 3600 cannot be used to satisfy ECE technical requirement." Is that referring to technical elective (OTE) or technical writing?

 Also, on the Liberal Studies 'Other Yes List', ENGRG 3600 is listed but the course name is slightly different (approved Spring 2008). Is this enough of a change to warrant having to re-petition the course or is it still fine to use as a liberal study for category KCM (surprisingly not category CE?)?

  To your first question: it means it can't count either as 3000+ ECE or as OTE (because it's not a technical course).  It can count as liberal studies or as AAE.
 </p>
 <p>
  To your second question: still fine to use as KCM LS.  Not CE because it's not primarily a writing class.  In fact, I think you need to sign up for ECE 3023 (or something like that) in parallel for it to kill off technical writing.

   To follow up, would 3600 (3 cred) + 3023 (1 cred) count as 4 credits of liberal studies or only 3 credits of liberal studies?

    I don't know the answer to that one.  Similarly, I don't know whether ECE 4920, the 1-credit writing follow-up to ECE 4760, gives you 1 credit of LS.  I'd check with Engineering Advising.

     Found the answer, was looking into the approved liberal studies list and turns out ENGRC 3023 was denied back in 2015.
