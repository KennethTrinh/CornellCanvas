  I got a 5 on AP Biology in High School, and the engineering handbook says that is worth 8 credits. Is that true and if so what section does it count towards. Can it get me out of a liberal studies, OTE, or Advisor Approved Elective. Thank you!

  You can use 4 credits toward OTE and the other four toward AAE.  No luck for liberal studies.
