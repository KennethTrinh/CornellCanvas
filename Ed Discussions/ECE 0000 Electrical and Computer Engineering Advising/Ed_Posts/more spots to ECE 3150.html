  Is there any plans to add more spots to ECE 3150?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Lab 403 (in the evening) got filled yesterday morning, and in my wait for that to have an open spot (as the other labs wouldn't work for me), the lecture was also filled this morning.
 </paragraph>

  It is a required foundation course (between ECE 3030 and 3150), and it is only offered in the Spring. I was planning on taking ECE 4740 as my CDE, which requires 3150 as a pre-requisite, and 4740 is also only offered in the Spring, it seems.

  Just a heads up, ECE 4740 actually switch to being a fall offered course this year due to ECE 5745 being offered in the spring. It caught a lot of people off guard this year so just keep an eye on the roster next year.

  A Monday evening lab, with an attending increase in the lecture cap, is in the works.

  If I am a junior, and my pre-enrollment period ends at midnight tonight, how can I enroll if this isn't done by midnight tonight?

  Add/Drop begins January 19th for Juniors and class begins January 24th. While it may be inconvenient, you should be able to get the spot since it is unlikely that seniors will fill the new lab section the day before and the sophomores will get access to the remaining spots the day after.

  If there are sophomores that are waiting for this class to open up again, they will still have access to pre-enrollment until tomorrow midnight. So, they might take those spots. (assuming this will be resolved soon)

  I personally don't know why one group's window has to close when the next group's opens. I can imagine a system in which seniors can still adjust their schedules while juniors, sophomores, and first-years are enrolling, and so on down the line. Why they don't do it that way I don't know. This is a question for the registrar's office. The good news is that most of our classes can accommodate arbitrary numbers of students. We can keep raising the cap as necessary. So if you want to take 2720, 3100, or 3150 next term, it's a pretty safe bet that you will get in.

  There are some exceptions, the most notable being ECE 1210. The flipped nature of that class means that it has to be taught in certain rooms that have certain capacities. Once that class is full it is full. There are a few other classes like that, but most have elastic capacities.

  Another mystery is why it is called "pre-enrollment." In my opinion there is nothing "pre" about this.
