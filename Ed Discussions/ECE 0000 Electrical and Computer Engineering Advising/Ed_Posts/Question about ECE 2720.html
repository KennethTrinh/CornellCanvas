  ECE 2720 does not count towards the Advanced Programming Checkoff (unsure about the ENGRD part). ECE 4750 would count as Advanced Programming and CDE.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  "Courses that meet this requirement include: ECE 2400, CS 2110, ENGRD 3200, AEP 4380, ECE 4740, ECE 4750, or ECE 4760. Other courses may be allowed by an ECE petition."

  And you can't count 2720 simultaneously as Core and ENGRD.
