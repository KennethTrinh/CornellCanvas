 Hello!
</p>
<p>
 Can ECE 2720 count as an engineering distribution and Advanced Programming and Required Core Courses?
</p>
<p>
 Can ECE 4750 count as an Advanced programming and CDE?
</p>
<p>
 Thank you!!

  And you can't count 2720 simultaneously as Core and ENGRD.

   ECE 2720 does not count towards the Advanced Programming Checkoff (unsure about the ENGRD part). ECE 4750 would count as Advanced Programming and CDE.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Courses that meet this requirement include: ECE 2400, CS 2110, ENGRD 3200, AEP 4380, ECE 4740, ECE 4750, or ECE 4760. Other courses may be allowed by an ECE petition."

    Can CS 2210 count as both ENGRD and Advanced Programming?
