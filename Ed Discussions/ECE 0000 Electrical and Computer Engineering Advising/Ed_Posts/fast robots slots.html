  No, sadly. The course is equipment-limited. We are setting up a waitlist, however. Email ugrad-coordinator@ece.cornell.edu to join. Some students will inevitably drop the course, which will free up slots.

  [Corrected to say that students should email to join the waitlist --- it is not run through studentcenter.]

  While I understand the want for the department to have an internal waitlist, this seems highly inconvenient as only those who have read this post are aware that they must email the Ugrad Coordinator to join it.

  Will this information be posted in a place more public to Engineering majors, or does the department plan to switch to the Student Center waitlist system in the future?
 </paragraph>

  For example: CIS has an online FAQ with information about waitlising their courses.

  (Not that I agree with all CIS policies, like preventing non-CIS majors from enrolling in a decent number of 4000-level courses)

  Thanks for mentioning this Harris!

  Multiple departments have been trying to determine the best way to offer and manage a waitlist with the current tools available. ECE's waitlist process is still a work in progress, and we appreciate the feedback provided to be able to help us shape this going forward. Since waitlists weren't put in place in Student Center before pre-enroll began, students who have been able to pre-enroll or have inquired about enrolling in a course would miss out on the opportunity if we used this process now.

  Keep in mind, most ECE courses won't have a waitlist. Currently if a course has a waitlist with it, it's typically  from the course reaching the enrollment capacity, ECE still receiving responses and questions with interest in the course, and then the waitlist being created as per instruction by the instructor. With the current process, if a course has a waitlist associated with it, we are taking  into account any of the emails and requests faculty receive and also any in the Ugrad Coordinator and staff specific inboxes. Each situation is being handled based on the individual circumstance of the course as well as the preference of the instructor, so we don't have an overall waitlist policy at this time.

  We understand how frustrating and stressful it can be to not be able to enroll in classes you were hoping to take. Class sizes and the possibility to increase them are based on multiple factors like faculty preference and support, class room size and availability, equipment access, and more, so increasing enrollment numbers is not always an option. ECE course enrollment levels are monitored during the Pre-Enroll and Add/Drop periods to see if any adjustments can be made.

  For questions about specific classes please contact the specific faculty of the course and the

  ugrad-coordinator@ece.cornell.edu email directly, we are happy to help!
