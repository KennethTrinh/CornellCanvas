 Will ECE 2400 be offered in the spring to make up for this semesters cancelation?

 (Question on behalf of incoming engineering freshman)

    Batten is going to teach ECE4750 due to the previous professor departing.

     Disappointing but on the upside I am excited to teach ECE 4750 this fall!

   Unlikely, unfortunately. ECE 2400 has historically been a fall class, so there were no plans in place to offer it SP23. We're weren't able to offer it FA22, even with prior plans in place to do so. Offering it SP23 will be that much harder.
  </p>
  <p>
   EDIT: The context is that we have to cancel ECE 2400/ENGRD 2140 this Fall because of a major staffing issue that came up over the summer. Prof. Apsel, Prof. Batten, and I spent considerable time over the last few weeks trying to find a way to cover the course, but we were unsuccessful.
  </p>
  <p>
   An announcement went out to everyone enrolled in either ECE 2400 or ENGRD 2140 yesterday. We will be working with the Engineering Registrar to move them into CS 2110, assuming they are interested and it fits in their schedule.
  </p>
  <p>
   I expect that ECE 2400 and ENGRD 2140 will disappear from the official roster Tuesday or Wednesday of next week.
  </p>

   I apologize to everyone affected by this. I think ECE 2400 is a great class and I'm sad to see it canceled. I'll point out the constraints we are under, not to make excuses but in the interest of transparency:
  </p>
  <list style="bullet">
   <li>
    <p>
     Hiring a new tenure-track professor takes a minimum of one year, and often two or even three. Hiring a new lecturer is only slightly faster. Academic hiring happens on a yearly cycle, with interviews occurring in the Spring.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     We use all our available instructors every semester, so we have no margin to absorb sudden departures, health and parental leaves, etc.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Even if we did have spare instructors around, we are a broad department, offering courses spanning semiconductor physics to information theory. So even though we have around 40 instructors on staff, the number of people who can teach any given class is not that large.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     When we end up short instructors, we have to triage courses. If we cancel a CDE or foundation class unexpectedly, it can literally prevent seniors from graduating on time. ECE 2400, for all its many virtues (and I believe it has many), is unlikely to be needed for anyone's graduation checklist.
    </p>

  </list>
