 As alluded to in the Spring, we are introducing an undergraduate version of ECE 5470, Computer Vision. The course number will almost surely be ECE 4230, and it should appear in the roster later this week. The course will meet simultaneously with ECE 5470.

  Any updates on this course? Add deadline is next Tuesday and it's not in the roster - would we be able to add it after the deadline?

   I talked to Devan this morning and I understand it should appear very soon, hopefully this afternoon. We're not sure what's causing the delay. If it does appear after the add deadline we can move people manually from the grad version to the undergrad version as necessary.

     I saw it came out today! Do you know what the process would be like for manually getting added to the roster?

    It's coming. I promise. It just takes a while for it to be added to the roster. I suggest enrolling in 5470 for now.
