  I am really interested in taking ECE 5640, however, I have never taken the pre-requisite (ECE 5110/ECE 4110).

  Will I be able to survive? How is ECE 5110 different from ECE 3250 and ECE 3110?

  I am thinking about taking ECE 5640 and ECE 5110 together next semester. Will I be able to survive?

  I assume you mean ECE 3100 when you write ECE 3110.  I recommend you ask the ECE 5640 instructor for advice on this.
