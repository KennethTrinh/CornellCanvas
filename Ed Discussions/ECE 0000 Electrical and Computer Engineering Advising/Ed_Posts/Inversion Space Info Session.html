 ECE Alum Parker Miller (BS ’20, MEng ’21) will be here to recruit for Inversion on Thursday October 13th. Please see below/attached.
</p>
<p>
 Inversion Space is a start-up based in Torrance, CA, building low-cost, high cadence, capsules to return cargo to Earth. We recently received $10m in seed funding late last year and are currently working on our demonstration capsule, Ray, for our 1st launch in 2023!
</p>
<p>
 Inversion was founded in 2021 with the mission to build the first affordable, high cadence return capability for the commercial and defense space industries. With launching to space becoming cheap and frequent, comparable options for return must become available to allow for a robust economy in space. We believe in a future where returning from space is as common as launching to space. Inversion is building reentry vehicles faster and cheaper than ever before through a focus on simplicity.
</p>
<p>
 We are looking for ECE students interested in avionics, controls, embedded systems, and GNC to help us build re-entry space capsules! You will be working across multiple engineering teams &amp; disciplines to apply your knowledge and skillset to real aerospace problems. If you've demonstrated a commitment to academic success and want to apply that fundamental knowledge to real-space problems, then Inversion is looking for you.
</p>
<p>
 If you'd like to learn more and chat with our team, we will be holding an info session followed by a meet and greet on Thursday, October 13th from 12 to 1:30pm.
</p>
<p>
 The info session and discussion will be from 12-12:30pm in Phillips 233 (ECE Conference Room) and meet and greet from 12:30-1:30pm in the Phillips 232 (ECE Lounge).
