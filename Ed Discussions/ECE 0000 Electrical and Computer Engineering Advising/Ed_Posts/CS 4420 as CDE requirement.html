<p>
 Taking CS 4420 instead of ECE 4750 (I believe same class, different titles) still qualifies to fill the CDE requirement correct? If so, can I use this to qualify for both my CDE requirement and use as part of my CS minor?
</p>

  You may take CS 4420. ECE does not care if you take the cross-listed version of a course.
