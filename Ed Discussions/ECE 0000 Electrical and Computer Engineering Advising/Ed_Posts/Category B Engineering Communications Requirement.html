  For the writing-Intensive (W-I) or Communication-Intensive (C-I) engineering course category, I took info 1200 but I was wondering if that class counts towards the ECE engineering requirement even though it's not an ECE class. Or do I have to take an ECE WI or CI class under category B. If I don't end up using info 1200 towards the communications requirement, can I count it for liberal studies? Thanks!

  INFO 1200 satisfies your Engineering Communications Requirement and simultaneously counts as a liberal-studies course in the CA category.
