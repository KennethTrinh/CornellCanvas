  Given that different lectures correspond to different topics within ECE4960, is it possible to enroll in distinct lectures at the same time or take this course twice and still have it count as two different ECE electives in the graduation checklist?

  There is only one ECE 4960 lecture in SP22, so I assume this is referring to ECE 5960 (or asking in general). Yes, it is possible to simultaneously enroll in multiple lectures for ECE 5960 (or ECE 4960, when multiple are being offered), assuming the meeting times do not overlap. And you can take the class multiple times and count all of them as ECE electives on your checklist as long as the topics are different.
