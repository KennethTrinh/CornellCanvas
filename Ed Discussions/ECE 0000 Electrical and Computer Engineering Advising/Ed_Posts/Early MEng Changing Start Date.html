  If we originally get accepted for the Spring Early MEng, is it possible to later change the MEng start date to another semester besides the following Fall (e.g. the Spring semester or the Fall semester of the next year)? I'm just wondering since my circumstances might change between now and next Fall. Thank you!

  would be the person to answer this. Would you go on leave during the interim, or would you remain active in the undergraduate program during that time?

  If you apply for your Early Admit semester to SP 23, and your actual semester to enroll in the MEng Program to be F 23, and if you're admitted and you choose to accept your offer before 04/15/2023, you would need to contact me directly if your plans change.

 <paragraph>
  Specifically, if you would be pursuing an internship or full-time employment, the possibility exists for you to defer actually enrolling in the MEng program.

 <paragraph>
  If your question is about changing what would be your Early Admit semester, that actually can't happen.

  I hope this answers your question, please contact me directly at sec36@cornell.edu or come see me in 223 PH for more info.
