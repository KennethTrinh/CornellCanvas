  Good question --- another course I'm not familiar with.  Doesn't look as if it has math/sci/engr pre-requisites, but apparently MAE "likes" it based on enrollment restrictions.

 <paragraph>
  I think ECE will need to talk about this one in the context of an upcoming broader OTE discussion.

  See #304 for a similar kind of OTE-related thing.

  Thanks for the quick response! I'm taking this course to fulfill a robotics minor requirement, so I assumed it was technical enough to be considered an OTE. Will the results of the OTE discussion be posted somewhere?

  Could you point me to where the robotics minor mentions it?

  ECE will  publicize any revision of the OTE requirement, but I hope to get a decision on this course and the course in #304 independent of any such revision.

  On the robotics minor website, DEA 5210 is one of the courses listed under the "Systems and Design" category in Group B. Thank you for your help!
