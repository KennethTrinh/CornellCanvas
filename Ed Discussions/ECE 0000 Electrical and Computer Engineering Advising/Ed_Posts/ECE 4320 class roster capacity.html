 Last month during pre-enroll it was mentioned that the class capacity would be raised for ECE 4320, but could not be done in time before pre-enroll closed. Has that been done as of yet and what we see in Student Center is the final class capacity and is thus closed, or has the increase not happened yet and we will have an opportunity to get into that class during add/drop?

  The capacity for ECE 4320 should be updated as of sometime last week.

   For those wondering, on Student Center it shows ECE 4320 as closed (10 enrolled) but crosslisted MAE 4320 as open (8 enrolled).

   Add/Drop always brings changes.  I conjecture that the capacity change just hasn't happened yet.  I'd suggest checking with the instructor for a definitive answer.
