 Right now I am in a bit of a bind and am not sure how I want to proceed. Next semester I am going abroad and thus cannot take 3150 now, and as a junior I will not be able to sequence VLSI after microelectronics. The institution I am going to does offer an equivalent course but it is taught in Spanish and conflicts with my schedule anyway. Is there any way I can take VLSI eg by selfstudy or like being the singular remote 3150 auditor or something?

  You could ask the current 4740 instructor how strict the 3150 prereq is. My sense is that 3150 is not required if you engage in appropriate self-study and are willing to tolerate a some extra grade risk.

   Since you'll be abroad, you wouldn't be able to enroll in ECE 3150 here in Ithaca, remotely or otherwise unfortunately.

   Is there any way that you could find somewhere that you could potentially take the equivalent of ECE 3150 at another university over the summer and then transfer the credits? That may potentially work.
