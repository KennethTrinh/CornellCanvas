  Is the class roster completely finalized?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I am wondering because a couple of classes do not have a description and because I want to know if any other class (like another special topics class) is going to be offered.

  A 6000-level special topics course on quantum computing has been approved and will appear soon. Also a 5000-level version of ECE 4370 - Photonics: Fundamentals and Devices. Also a Cornell Tech class.

  I do not see a course description for GPS, fast robots, and the special topics in ECE. I did see that fast robots posted a syllabus.

  I would assume GPS would be similar to the SP20 offering and the Special Topics: Network Dynamics and Games to be similar to the FA21 offering, each of which have course descriptions and syllabi posted.
