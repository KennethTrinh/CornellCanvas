 Is the class roster completely finalized?
</p>
<p>
 I am wondering because a couple of classes do not have a description and because I want to know if any other class (like another special topics class) is going to be offered.

  A 6000-level special topics course on quantum computing has been approved and will appear soon. Also a 5000-level version of ECE 4370 - Photonics: Fundamentals and Devices. Also a Cornell Tech class.
 </p>
 <p>
  Which classes don't have descriptions?

   I do not see a course description for GPS, fast robots, and the special topics in ECE. I did see that fast robots posted a syllabus.

    I would assume GPS would be similar to the SP20 offering and the Special Topics: Network Dynamics and Games to be similar to the FA21 offering, each of which have course descriptions and syllabi posted.
