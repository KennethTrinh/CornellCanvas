  On the program requirements website (
  <link href="https://www.ece.cornell.edu/ece/programs/undergraduate-programs/majors/program-requirements"/>
  https://www.ece.cornell.edu/ece/programs/undergraduate-programs/majors/program-requirements), it states "CS 4120 and CS 4410, along with their associated practica, are acceptable as 4000-level ECE technical electives."
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Would CS 4414 also be accepted as a 4000-level ECE technical elective?

  ECE hasn't considered that course, which is new as of the last couple of years.  Petitioning it would trigger the relevant ECE committee to have a look.

  Can you file a petition without taking the course? In my case, I would like to take it in my final semester. I see on the form that you technically need to attach your graduation checklist for the petition to be reviewed.
