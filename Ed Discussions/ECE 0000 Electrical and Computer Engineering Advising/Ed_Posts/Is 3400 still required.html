  I just want to make sure that even though my handbook lists 3400 as a requirement (I entered fall 2020) it is not a requirement since I took 2720.

  It is not required for anyone graduating in Dec. 2021 or later. Thus it is not required of anyone who is still here. The required number of 3000+ ECE electives was increased by one at the same time, however, so the overall number of 3000+ ECE courses that you need to take remains the same. You are welcome to take ECE 3400 and count it toward that requirement, but you can rely on other 3000+ ECE courses if prefer.

  EDIT: whether you took ECE 2720 or ECE 2200 is immaterial.

  So if I took 2720 I follow the same checklist and requirements as in the handbook for students who entered in 2021 (except the extra physics lab class).
