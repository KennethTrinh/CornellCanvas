 Business minor classes don't count as liberal studies. Kind of a long shot, but could I use them as a an outside technical elective? I already have my advisor approved electives filled from my project team.

  Some business-centric courses work as OTE, e g. ORIE 3150, CEE 3230, and some entrepreneurship courses.  Not sure whether those count toward business minor.  AEM courses generally don't work for OTE.

   Does ORIE 4152/ENGRG 4610/MAE 4610 count as an OTE?
