  Here's a link to the currently petitioned and approved liberal-studies courses:
 </p>
 <p>
  <a href="https://apps.engineering.cornell.edu/liberalstudies/ApprovedLiberalStudies.pdf">
   https://apps.engineering.cornell.edu/liberalstudies/ApprovedLiberalStudies.pdf
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  This page links to lists of petitioned courses, both approved and denied:
 </p>
 <p>
  <link href="https://apps.engineering.cornell.edu/liberalstudies/"/>
  https://apps.engineering.cornell.edu/liberalstudies/
 </p>
 <p>
  The second link also links to all liberal studies courses by LS category --- a separate link for each category.  You can search for specific non-petitioned courses there, but you have to search one category at a time.
 </p>
 <p>
  The college used to post a master list of all liberal studies courses, and they still might, but I've been unable to find it.
 </p>
 <p>
  A liberal-studies course's catalogue entry usually (but not always) has a LS designation.  Like ECON 1110 has SBA-AS, meaning it's an SBA LS course offered by the College of Arts and Sciences.

   Additional comment: the first list above is incomplete --- it lists only the
   <i>
    petitioned
   </i>
   liberal studeis courses that have been approved.  The second link allows you to link to
   <i>
    all
   </i>
   approved liberal studies by category.  My apologies!

   I've edited my original reply to reflect all this.
