 I was wondering as an ECE major interested in fulfilling premed requirements, should I enroll in CHEM 2090 or CHEM 2070 in the Fall?
</p>
<p>
 I realize that CHEM 2090 is for engineering specifically, but am wary of enrolling in an 'engineer specific' chem that isn't adequate for premed/MCAT prep.
</p>
<p>
 Also of note: I am a transfer with credit for CHEM 2090 already (but no lab)

  CHEM 2090 is fine I think. There's a website that goes over most of this: https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/students/undergraduate-students/advising/pre-health/pre-health-guides
