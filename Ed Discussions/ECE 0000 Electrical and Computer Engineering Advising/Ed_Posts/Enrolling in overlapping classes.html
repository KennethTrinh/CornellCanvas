 Hello, I am really attempting to take OS and ECE 4760 next semester. However, the one lab section that fit into my schedule was filled up. I heard that ECE 4760 lab hours weren't extremely strict on you having to show up during your lab period. Rather, I heard the lab sections were more like office hours, and that you could go to any of them if you'd like. In this case, is there a way that I can petition to enroll in a lab section that overlaps with another class of mine?

  You can certainly petition --- the engineering college has a specific procedure for that.  No guarantee they'd approve it.
