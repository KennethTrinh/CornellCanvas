  What are some classes you are allowed to add the 1-credit communication course onto?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I think I am planning to do this instead of taking an Engineering Communication course itself?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1. Is this allowed?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. What courses can I add this on? What does it entail? What is the course code?

    ENGRC 3023, a 1cr attachment to an engineering course that is not one of the officially designated W-I or C-I courses. CE instructors may occasionally wish to extend communication competencies with added work inside their course for a given semester so that it will fulfill the Engineering Communications Requirement. With the approval of the CCGBâ€™s Subcommittee on Engineering Communications, instructors may have students co-register in
    <link href="http://courses.cornell.edu/content.php?catoid=12&amp;navoid=2097#tt7997"/>
    Requirements for ENGRC 3023, which may be taken more than once with different courses by permission of the engineering instructors. This option does not also fulfill the Liberal Studies requirement, even via petition. For questions or an appointment to discuss options,
