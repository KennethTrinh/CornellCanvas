 What are some classes you are allowed to add the 1-credit communication course onto?
</p>
<p>
 I think I am planning to do this instead of taking an Engineering Communication course itself?
</p>
<p>
 1. Is this allowed?
</p>
<p>
 2. What courses can I add this on? What does it entail? What is the course code?
</p>

CE instructors may occasionally wish to extend communication competencies with added work inside their course for a given semester so that it will fulfill the Engineering Communications Requirement.
