  Has anyone successfully gotten into the class though the waitlist?
  <break>
  </break>
  Want to take the class in the spring, but since I canâ€™t pre enroll in it was wondering the likelihood of getting in is.

 <paragraph>
  Also does being on the wait list auto enroll you into the class, so you need to keep that time slot empty?

  Thanks

  Hi there!
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Speaking from experience: I believe non-CS majors have gotten off the waitlist in previous semesters, but this semester was different. I was (still am) around 13th on the waitlist and still haven't gotten in. Granted, there were substantially fewer TAs than usual. However, despite select cases where students needed the course to graduate, the professor and CIS enrollment staff collectively maintained a bureaucratic blockade and removed everyone on the waitlist from the canvas page. After attempting to express that this class fulfills a 4000+ ECE class, the CIS staff robotically asserted that CS majors are given priority, and that everyone else should submit to a subordinate position in their hierarchy (so much for Any Person, Any Study)! In short, there is no guarantee that you will get the class. As a follow up to the ECE department, can we possibly request priority enrollment in pre-enroll? After all, this class is an upper-level ECE course...

  We can of course submit a request to CS that they enroll ECE students ahead of their own students, but I doubt that would go anywhere. CS 4410 is not, in fact, an ECE course. It is not owned or taught by ECE. It is not even cross-listed as an ECE course. It merely counts toward an ECE degree the way an ECE course would.

  As a general matter, being on the waitlist does not automatically enroll you in a class when space opens up. Assuming the class is configured to lock when it becomes full for the first time, either the registrar would need to add you or the dept. offering the class would need to send you a PIN.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If the class is not set to lock, then when a space opens up it is a free-for-all, and the first person to enroll gets the slot, regardless of where they are on the waitlist, or whether they are on the waitlist at all. Yes, that is unexpected behavior that arguably defeats the purpose of a waitlist. Usually when the waitlist is enabled for a class, the class is set to lock upon initial fill-up, but no guarantees. It sounds like CS 4410 locked.

  Needless to say, I personally feel that the waitlist system that Cornell uses has room for improvement, and I believe it will be eventually. But that is how it works now.
