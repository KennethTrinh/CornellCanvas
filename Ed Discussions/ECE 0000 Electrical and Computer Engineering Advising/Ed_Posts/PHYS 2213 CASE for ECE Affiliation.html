  Can we take the PHYS 2213 Case Exam to affiliate with ECE major?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The affiliation requirement says:
 </paragraph>
 <list style="unordered">
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    Must have completed with a grade of C+ or better: MATH 2930, PHYS 2213, and either ECE/ENGRD 2100, ECE 2720, or ECE/ENGRD 2300,
    <bold>
     except that for courses on this list taken in Spring 2020, a C- or an S will suffice
    </bold>
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
 </list>
 <paragraph>
  Does that mean we can't use the CASE to affiliate?

  You can pass the CASE and still satisfy ECE affiliation requirements.
