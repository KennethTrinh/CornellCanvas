 Can we take the PHYS 2213 Case Exam to affiliate with ECE major?
</p>
<p>
 The affiliation requirement says:
</p>
<list style="unordered">
 <li>
  <p>
   Must have completed with a grade of C+ or better: MATH 2930, PHYS 2213, and either ECE/ENGRD 2100, ECE 2720, or ECE/ENGRD 2300,
   <b>
    except that for courses on this list taken in Spring 2020, a C- or an S will suffice
   </b>
  </p>
 </li>
</list>
<p>
 Does that mean we can't use the CASE to affiliate?

  You can pass the CASE and still satisfy ECE affiliation requirements.
