 I am slightly confused about the ECE MEng. design project. Do we need to contact professors individually to create or find a project, or will there be projects assigned to each student?

  Project lists are made available to students. This may be slightly different for Early Admits, but not by much. Your best bet is to contact me directly - Scott Coldren, sec36@cornell.edu. Happy to help with any specific questions you may have.
