  Good question!  I've never heard of the course until now.

   Has ECE decided anything on this?
  </p>
  <p>
   It looks like MAE decided 2 months ago to allow it to count towards MAE's 'advisor approved elective' category, but not allowed towards MAE's 'technical elective' as they required the course must be taken graded (unlike ECE which permits S/U exclusive courses).

    ECE will review all the rules for the OTE requirement this coming spring, but I think the ECE Curriculum and Standards Committee  might be able to discuss this particular course in isolation for students who need a quick answer.

     Update: today the relevant committee approved this course for OTE.
