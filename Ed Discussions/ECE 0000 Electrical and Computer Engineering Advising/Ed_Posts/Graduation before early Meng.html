 Is it possible to graduate in the Fall of 2023 if we want to start the early admit Meng program in the Spring of 2024 semester?

  To answer your question as you've phrased it above, no it's not possible to graduate with a DEC 23 degree, and then pursue the Early Admit option.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Dave had said, the Early Admit option only happens in your final semester of enrollment as an undergraduate.

  I would suggest emailing me directly at sec36@cornell.edu for more info, or, come to see me in person in 223 PH.

   "Early M.Eng." means that during one semester you're still finishing undergrad requirements while simultaneously taking courses toward your M.Eng.  If you finish undergrad requirements in Fall 2023 and take your first M.Eng. courses in Spring of 2024, you'd be doing "regular M.Eng." starting in Spring 2024 rather than Early M.Eng. starting that semester.
