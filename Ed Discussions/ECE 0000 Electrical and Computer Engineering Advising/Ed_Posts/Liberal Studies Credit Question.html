  Hi!
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I have taken 5 liberal arts and have 14 credits. Can I take 7 liberal arts and be over the 18 credit requirement or does it have to be 6 classes that are 18 credits total?

  Seven courses for 18 or more credits is fine.

  I petitioned when I had 5 for 21 credits and got it, I think they care more about hitting the three distribution requirements and having 18 total credits or more.
