   Thank you.  I also have another question.
  </p>
  <p>
   If I took STS 3601, which is the same as ECE 3600, could I use it to fulfill the writing requirement and still use as a Liberal Studies?

    ECE 3600 cannot be used to satisfy ECE technical requirement.

    See #69.

     Ok, was confused by
     <a href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/15657/discussion/1052811">
      #66
     </a>
     and that #69 didn't explicitly state that it couldn't be used.
    </p>
    <p>
     Also neverminded, found the old canvas page for it and I did not sign up to use it as a technical writing.

     You can use it as liberal studies and it simultaneously satisfies tech writing no matter what course number you sign up for it under.
