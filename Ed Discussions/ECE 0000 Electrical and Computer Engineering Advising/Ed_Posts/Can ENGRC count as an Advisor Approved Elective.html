  Thank you.  I also have another question.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If I took STS 3601, which is the same as ECE 3600, could I use it to fulfill the writing requirement and still use as a Liberal Studies?

  You can use it as liberal studies and it simultaneously satisfies tech writing no matter what course number you sign up for it under.

  ECE 3600 cannot be used to satisfy ECE technical requirement.

  Ok, was confused by
  <link href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/15657/discussion/1052811"/>
  #66 and that #69 didn't explicitly state that it couldn't be used.

  Also neverminded, found the old canvas page for it and I did not sign up to use it as a technical writing.
