  Can ECE 4920 be taken concurrently with ECE 4760 to complete our technical writing requirement? Alternatively, can it also be taken after ECE 4760?

  In ECE 4920, you are creating a formal write up of your ECE 4760 final project. You would have to have completed 4760 before taking 4920, so it doesn't not make sense to take it concurrently.
