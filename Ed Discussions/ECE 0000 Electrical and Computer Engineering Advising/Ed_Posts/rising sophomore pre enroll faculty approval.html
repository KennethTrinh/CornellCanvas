  Hello! I've sent a couple emails to my faculty advisor over the past week and also went to his office to try to set up a meeting for course approval but haven't gotten a response. What can I do?

  Since all current first year students need to be "cleared" to pre-enroll by their faculty advisor, it is important to try to reach them.  Can you send me a separate email at lnf27@cornell.edu to discuss options further? I can try to give guidance if I know who your faculty advisor is.  Also, you could try to speak with the undergraduate coordinator in ECE to see if they can reach your faculty advisor.  Please let me know.

  As ECE Advising Coordinator, I can reach out to your faculty advisor if all else fails, but unfortunately I can't clear you for pre-enroll.
