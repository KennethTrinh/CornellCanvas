 I'm looking for recommendations for Outside Tech Electives!
</p>
<p>
 I have taken project team and CS 2800 as my previous OTEs and am looking for one more this semester (graduating May 2023).
</p>
<p>
 I can't take OS or CV due to scheduling conflicts, although I know they are popular OTEs. Currently, I am enrolled in CEE 3230 but have not met anyone who has taken it so I am interested if anyone has taken it and would recommend it.
</p>
<p>
 Thanks!

  I took CEE 3230 last year and it was pretty decent, the first part of the course is mostly Finance based stuff (which is a present throughout the whole course), focusing on estimating costs, Present/Future value calculations and calculating rate of return of projects or investments (power plants or other business propositions). That stuff was relatively straight forward and just requires understanding formulas and basic math. The second part of the course focused on Taxes/depreciation, multi-criteria decision making or decision making using quantitative/qualitative methods, and some sustainability stuff.

  I don't think the class was overly difficult or complicated, but can be challenging at first if you have never done an finance or accounting. Everything is largely basic math though and needing to solve some quadratic equation to find a minimum cost or the expected rate of return of engineering projects and other civil engineering stuff. I'd definitely recommend finding the syllabus and seeing if its something you'd want to learn about for a full semester.
