 I am a freshman who is interested in majoring in ECE but haven't affiliated yet. I plan to take some ECE foundation courses in FA22 but have no idea which 3 to select among the 5. Where can I get major-specific advice on this?

  Also keep in mind that ECE 2400 makes a great second ENGRD especially if you are interested in computer engineering.

   Where are you in the math and physics sequences?  Also, which of the required 2000-level ECE classes have you taken so far?

    I will have taken all the required math, physics, and 2000-level ECE classes by the end of this semester.

     Okay, regarding the ECE Foundation Courses:
    </p>
    <p>
     = Two represent the more applied-math side of ECE: ECE 3250 and ECE 3100
    </p>
    <p>
     = Two represent the more applied-physics side of ECE: ECE 3030 and ECE 3150
    </p>
    <p>
     = One represents the computer-systems side of ECE: ECE 3140
    </p>
    <p>
     I suggest looking at higher-level stuff and choose Foundation Courses by considering pre-requisites and where your interests lie.  You need to take one of the physics-centric ones and one of the math-centric ones eventually.  Many students take four, some take all five --- extras work as 3000+ ECE Electives.
    </p>

     3030 and 3250 happen only in the fall; the others happen only in the spring.  if you wanted to take two this coming fall, it would be 3030 and 3250.
