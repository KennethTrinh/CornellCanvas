 I have been doing a lot of research on the MEng. classes offered at the Ithaca campus. I think that a lot of the 5000+ level ORIE MEng. classes are very similar to what has been offered in the ECE department.
</p>
<p>
 I know some CS MEng. courses can be counted as ECE MEng. core classes. I am wondering if it is possible to petition some 5000+ level ORIE classes to be counted as ECE MEng. core classes?

  Yes, it's possible to petition to potentially have a 5000+ level course offered by another field in engineering added to the Outside ECE Core Course.

  Now, that having been said, you will need to make a solid case as to why this should happen, how it will benefit your academic goals and career plans. Petitions are reviewed by the MEng Committee and then they will render a decision.
