  In student center I was only able to enroll in EAS 2250 which is crosslisted as ENGRD 2250 but I want to use it as my ENGRD. Do I have to get it changed or is taking EAS fine.

  This one I'm sure of: either works. For an undergrad ECE degree, which version of a cross-listed course you enroll in is irrelevant. This is not necessarily true of other programs, but for a B.S. in ECE, all versions of a course are considered equivalent.

  I'm curious: how is it that you can enroll in one but not the other? Is ENGRD 2250 full while EAS 2250 is not?

  Yes, ENGRD 2250 is full and EAS is not.

  Strange. Usually the cap is pooled or they just force everyone into the ENGRD version. Digging into it, it appears that EAS has confused the ENGRD lecture with one of the discussion sections and set the cap accordingly. If this is important to the OP or anyone else, we can reach out to EAS to see if we can get it fixed.
