 Saw this course on the roster today and I can't find any other information about it. Is it new? If so, are there any suggested pre-reqs? It looks interesting but I can't tell if I have the correct preparation for it

  This is the problem with the registrar publishing the roster before the catalog!
 </p>
 <p>
  ECE 4240 is a cross-list of
  <a href="https://courses.cornell.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=45&amp;coid=815852">
   MAE 4810
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  EDIT: by "saw this course on the roster today" I assume you mean classes.cornell.edu. I can't fault the registrar for not posting the catalog ahead of the PDF I shared earlier this week.

   Could I assume that this course lives in MAE and would qualify as an OTE?

    From Prof. Delchamps: "Fine for OTE, doesn't count as your one permitted ECE OTE."
