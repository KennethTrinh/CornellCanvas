  Hi all! Every year on Dragon Day, the College of AAP creates a dragon and parades it around campus. In response, engineering students traditionally build a rival phoenix to represent the College of Engineering. If you are someone who is excited about design and hands-on manufacturing, we invite you to reach out! If anyone is interested in joining our project, please email me (
