 Do I have the option of counting a cross-listed course as either an OTE or ECE Elective at time of graduation? Or must I take it as ECE to count towards ECE Electives (or as the other department to count toward OTEs)?
</p>
<p>
 Examples: ECE/MAE 4320, ECE/EAS 4870

  ECE doesn't care how you sign up for cross-listed courses no matter where you count them on your Graduation Checkilist.  That said, the spirit of the OTE requirement calls for courses you count there to have "home department" other than ECE.  In that way, 4870 is fine for OTE while 4320 is questionable.  The OTE requirement comes from the engineering college, which gives individual majors leeway in enforcing it, so wiggle room exists.
