 Who should I look for to sign my co-op participation form? Should I go for my academic advisor or major undergraduate coordinator? Thank you so much in advance.

   It said that "meet with your major department to discuss your course plans. and secure their signature on the second page." I discussed my course plan with my major undergraduate coordinator but the academic advisor is also mentioned in the sign section as in the following picture. So I am not sure who I should go for.

    I think you're good as long as you get either Devan or me or both to sign off on it.

    Please keep us both in the loop.
