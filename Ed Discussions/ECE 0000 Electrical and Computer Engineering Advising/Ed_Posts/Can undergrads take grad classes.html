 I found 4750 interesting, and I want to take 5750, but I am not sure if that is allowed.

  That one's allowed.  Those two courses have both been around for a while and are wholly distinct.

  On the other hand, ECE recently established a number of so-called 5000-level co-meets for 4000-level courses that allow M.Eng. students to get M.Eng. credit for course work previously available only at the 4000-level.  Every co-meet features some extra work required of the M.Eng. students but not of those enrolled in the 4000-level course that spawned the co-meet.  Example: ECE 4271, the course I teach this semester, has 5000-level co-meet ECE 5271, targeted at M.Eng. students --- same lectures and exams with an extra coding assignment for M.Eng. students.

  The 5000-level co-meets are targeted at M.Eng. students, and doubtless some instructors would not grant undergraduates permission to enroll in them.
