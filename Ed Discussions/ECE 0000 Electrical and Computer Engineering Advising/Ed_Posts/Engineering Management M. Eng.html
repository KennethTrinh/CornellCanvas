 This is a bit of a strange question, but is it common - or cautioned against -  for ECE undergraduates to do the Engineering Management M. Eng at Cornell, or is this something geared way more towards civil engineers? I am definitely set on getting my masters, but I have seriously been debating on whether to do it in ECE or in Engineering Management, given my own personal reasons.

  To my knowledge, it's neither common nor cautioned against --- I have never heard of an ECE student doing it, nor have I heard of anyone's advising an ECE student against it.  I'll add that a smallish but significant number of ECE students have gone for the Systems Engineering M.Eng.
