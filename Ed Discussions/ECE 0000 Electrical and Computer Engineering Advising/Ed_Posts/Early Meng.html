 If we have 0 credits left, will we be forced to graduate early or is early MEng still possible?

  Dave is 100% correct - you have to have SOMETHING left to complete in your undergraduate degree. It could even be a PE course.

  After you work out the details with your Checklist with Dave, contact me directly to discuss specifics about applying for Early Admit - sec36@cornell.edu.

   You need at least 1 credit left to do Early M.Eng.  Sometimes a student can strategize to make that happen.  I can look at your Checklist and see whether anything jumps out at me.
