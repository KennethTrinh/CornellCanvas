  As I understand things:
 </p>
 <p>
  1. Before ECE approves a student's graduation, the student must submit a filled-out Graduation Checklist.
 </p>
 <p>
  2. ECE doesn't specify a date by which a graduating student must submit a Checklist.
 </p>
 <p>
  3. ECE encourages students to submit Checklists before their last semester in the program so Student Services staff can catch errors and omissions while there's still time to correct them.  Furthermore, ECE's end-of-semester-final-approval process runs efficiently when Checklists are already on file and the ECE authorities need only check final-semester grades.
