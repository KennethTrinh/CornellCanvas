 As title - can you take an ECE course to fulfill the CDE requirement and also use it to fulfill one of the 4000+ courses?

  You can't use one course toward both the CDE slot and one of the 4000+ Elective slots on the ECE Graduation Checklist at the same time.

   Wait, this really confuses me; per the requirements online:
  </p>
  <p>
   <i>
    "Every ECE major must take at least six (6) technical ECE courses at the 3000-level or above in addition to the three courses used to satisfy the Foundation Course requirement. These six courses must include at least three (3) courses at the 4000-level or above, at least one (1) of which is a Culminating Design Experience (CDE) course."
   </i>
  </p>
  <p>
   This is also indicated by the checklist, where there are 3 slots for 4000+ electives, one of which is labeled as CDE:

  <p>
   Your answer makes it sound like we need 3 4000+ electives
   <underline>
    as well as
   </underline>
   a CDE? I just want to confirm that we need 3 4000+ electives in total, including the CDE.

    Three 4000+ Electives at least one of which is a CDE.  See whether my edit clarifies my answer.  :-)

      FYI I wrote all the text in the online Major Requirements section.  If you or anyone else finds something unclear, please let me know.  Believe me, the current version improves significantly on previous ones.
