 On the Other Yes list for liberal studies, it says that ENGRG 4900: Project Team Leadership can count as one credit towards the requirement.  Does this mean that being a lead for any team can get me this credit, even if the enrollment isn't ENGRG 4900? For my case, my project team is SYSEN 4900, and I am enrolled in 4 credits, 3 for being a member of the team and 1 additional credit for being in a leadership role.  If I can count towards the liberal studies requirement, can I double-count the credits for being a lead for two semesters?

  ENGRG 4900 seems to be a completely separate seminar course in leadership, not the "team lead" portion that allows a 4th credit as seen in several student project team.

  If you would like your work completed as part of SYSEN 4900 to count towards the liberal study requirement, I suggest you first talk with the team's faculty advisor and then submit a General Petition to the Engineering Registrar based on the merit of your request.
