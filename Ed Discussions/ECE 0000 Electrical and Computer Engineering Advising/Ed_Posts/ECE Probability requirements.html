  It would be great if someone could include a list of courses in and and outside engineering that satisfy the requirement since I can't seem to find the list anywhere

  ECE deleted the list when they added ECE 2720, which satisfies the requirement, to the list of required ECE courses.  I managed to recover the old list from ECE's Web person --- I've included the text below.  Other courses have been approved by petition --- like, I recall that some 3000-level ECON course was approved earlier this year, and there's definitely a MATH course that works.

  Probability and Statistics Requirement
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  The courses that an ECE major takes to satisfy the ECE Major Requirements or the
  <break>
  </break>
  ENGRD requirement must include at least one course with significant probability
  <break>
  </break>
  content. ECE 2720, ECE 3100, ENGRD/ORIE 2700, CEE 3040, and MSE 5730 are
  <break>
  </break>
  appropriate such courses, but keep in mind that those courses are quite different
  <break>
  </break>
  and are by no means interchangeable. Other courses satisfying the probability and
  <break>
  </break>
  statistics requirement may be allowed by an ECE petition.

  But if we take ECE 3100 to satisfy the Probability requirement, then we can also
  <bold>
   double count
  </bold>
  this to satisfy one of the three 3000-level ECE foundation course requirements, is this understanding correct?

  I took ECON 3130 and got it approved by petition. Highly recommend that course.
