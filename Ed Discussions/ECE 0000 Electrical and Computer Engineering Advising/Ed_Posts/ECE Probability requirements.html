 Are there potention any economics courses that could count towards this requirement?

  It would be great if someone could include a list of courses in and and outside engineering that satisfy the requirement since I can't seem to find the list anywhere

  I took ECON 3130 and got it approved by petition. Highly recommend that course.

   ECE deleted the list when they added ECE 2720, which satisfies the requirement, to the list of required ECE courses.  I managed to recover the old list from ECE's Web person --- I've included the text below.  Other courses have been approved by petition --- like, I recall that some 3000-level ECON course was approved earlier this year, and there's definitely a MATH course that works.

   Probability and Statistics Requirement
   <break>
   </break>
   <break>
   </break>
   The courses that an ECE major takes to satisfy the ECE Major Requirements or the
   <break>
   </break>
   ENGRD requirement must include at least one course with significant probability
   <break>
   </break>
   content. ECE 2720, ECE 3100, ENGRD/ORIE 2700, CEE 3040, and MSE 5730 are
   <break>
   </break>
   appropriate such courses, but keep in mind that those courses are quite different
   <break>
   </break>
   and are by no means interchangeable. Other courses satisfying the probability and
   <break>
   </break>
   statistics requirement may be allowed by an ECE petition.

    But if we take ECE 3100 to satisfy the Probability requirement, then we can also
    <b>
     double count
    </b>
    this to satisfy one of the three 3000-level ECE foundation course requirements, is this understanding correct?

     Correct.
