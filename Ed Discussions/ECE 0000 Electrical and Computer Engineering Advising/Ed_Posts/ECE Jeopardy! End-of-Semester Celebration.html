  A full ECE Day is not in the cards this spring, but I'm happy that the School can support the faculty/student Jeopardy! game, which some students told me was their favorite part.

 <p>
  There are ongoing discussions among the faculty, staff, and students about whether ECE Day should be redesigned as a fall event with a different format. You are welcome to send me comments or suggestions. See you Tuesday.
