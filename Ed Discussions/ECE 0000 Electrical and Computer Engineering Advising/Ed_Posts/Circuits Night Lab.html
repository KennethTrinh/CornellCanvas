 Is it possible to have a night offering for Circuits lab? The current afternoon timeslots conflict with courses I want to take that have lectures/labs during that 3 hour period.

  Just to confirm, does Circuits refer to ECE 2100?

   Assuming this is referring to 2100 I can see the issue. To enroll in 2100 people need either their MWF or their Tue/Thu completely clear of lectures. I'm looking at moving one of the labs. It might have to move to 8-11 a.m. instead of the evening.

     We're moving both the Monday and Wednesday labs to the evening. The Monday lab is already showing as meeting M 7:30-10:30 and the Wed lab will follow suit shortly.
