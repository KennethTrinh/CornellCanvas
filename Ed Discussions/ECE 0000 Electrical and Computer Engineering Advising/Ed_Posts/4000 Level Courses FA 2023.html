  What is the difference between ECE 5725 and ECE 4760, and which one(or both) do you recommend for a CS and ECE double major?

  If you're CS and ECE, I think ECE 4750 is a must. Not only is it cross-listed (and you should take it as CS 4420 if you want it to count), but it's also probably the most fundamental computer engineering course.

  5725 and 4760 are both embedded-systems courses. If you're interested in that stuff, take both - I'm sure it'll be useful in some way. 4760 is also a CDE and a good external spec if your ECE and CS

  Thanks! I definitely gonna do 4750 and that counts as a CDE. Since I also have to do CS OS, are there any crosslisted contented with embedded OS? I am now choosing between 4760 and 5725....

  There aren't any cross-listed versions of ECE 5725 and ECE 4760 but there are other CS/ECE cross-listed classes. CS 4750/ECE 4770 for example is a good class I've heard

  I would place 5725 and 4760 in one bin, separate from 4750.

  ECE 4750, as a computer architecture class, is about how to design computers. It covers the tradeoffs in different approaches to designing microprocessors, memory systems, buses, etc. If you want to understand why the current generation of Intel CPUs are designed the way the are, 4750 is the class to take. Although the class is about hardware, the labs are simulation-based. You are not going to fry anything if you make a mistake. Of the three, it is closest to CS.

  ECE 5725 and 4760, as embedded systems classes, are about how to use small computers to build things that interact with the world, like simple robots, controllers, etc. The labs involve building and debugging with hardware. Both courses have open-ended final projects, and many of the cool class projects you see advertised around the School were built by students as part of 4760 or 5725. The

  Both 5725 and 4760 use single-board computers (that is, simple computers that fit entirely on a small circuit board). The difference between 5725 and 4760 is that 5725 uses a computer that is running a full-fledged OS. With 4760 there is no OS: you do all the programming yourself. So it is easier to run more sophisticated algorithms on the 5725 boards, but they also run slower. This opens up some use cases and closes off others.
