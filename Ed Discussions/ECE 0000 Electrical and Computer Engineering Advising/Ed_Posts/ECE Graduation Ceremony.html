  For MEng students graduating this December, would there be any graduation ceremony (both school-wise and major-wise)? If there is, do we have a rough timeline on when they will happen? Thanks!

  ECE itself only has a ceremony in May, to which both Dec. and May grads are invited. The University holds ceremonies in both Dec. and May. See

  here for information about the Dec. 2022 ceremony.
