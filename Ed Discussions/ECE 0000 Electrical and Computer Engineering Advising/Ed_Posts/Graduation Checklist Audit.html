  I heard at the town hall this week that we could audit a potential graduation checklist. I was wondering what the procedure would be/who I should get in touch with to get an audit.

  Additionally, would this procedure be the same for requesting my graduation year be changed?

  If you'd like ECE to "audit" your Graduation Checklist, send it by secure file transfer to ugrad-coordinator@ece.cornell.edu and we'll take it from there.  You can do that anytime, but you'll definitely need to do it if you request a change in graduation term

  Edit: turns out SFT doesn't work with ugrad-coordinator.  Instead, SFT to Sharif at se339@cornell.edu.
