  When I tried to add this course to my shopping cart in Student Center, it said that the lecture is still open for enrollment (green circle).
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  However, when it is actually in my shopping cart itself, there is a blue square - which means "closed" according to Student Center.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Does this mean the course has filled up?

  Thanks in advance.
