 When I tried to add this course to my shopping cart in Student Center, it said that the lecture is still open for enrollment (green circle).
</p>
<p>
 However, when it is actually in my shopping cart itself, there is a blue square - which means "closed" according to Student Center.
</p>
<p>
 Does this mean the course has filled up?
</p>
<p>
 Thanks in advance.
