  This error comes up when trying to submit the application for enrollment in Fall '23 while also having a B.S. degree date for Fall '23.  Will there be an edit to the application to allow this to happen for early application students before the deadline?

  Yes, this is a common issue.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  SHORT VERSION - list your degree date as MAY 23 and the term you're applying for as FALL 2023. This should work.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  LONG VERSION - The system won't let you apply for admission for fall when you list your intended degree date as December. The logic isn't built into the system formatting for this to work.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  We only admit students for Fall admission. (The only exceptions for this are Early Admits, and the occasional Cornell Student whose first semester of enrollment is in the spring due to timing for whatever reason; we would not make exceptions for external applicants.)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Early Admits are NOT considered MEng students. They have to actually complete their undergraduate degree, graduate. THEN, they will be considered MEng students when they actually matriculate and enroll in the MEng Program.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Because we only allow for Fall Admission and do not admit for the spring, the only timeframe for Early Admits to apply for consideration for their Early Admit Semester to be in the fall, is if they apply with the rest of the group that are applying for consideration for Fall admission.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The online application actually closes AFTER the January 15th deadline, which is why Early Admits are required to apply for consideration for their Early Admit Semester to be in the following fall, in mid-January.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  This is way more information that you likely want or care about, but there it is.

  If I could get some clarification. I'm looking to do the Early M.ENG semester in Fall 2023 and finish my M.ENG in the spring of 2024. This would mean I'm graduating undergrad in Fall 2023. You mentioned how the online application closes after January 15th, so does that mean in order to finish my BS/MENG in Spring 2024 I have to finish applying by January 15th or should I wait until after that deadline?

  Sorry, I didn't get a notification of your additional post. I wish you had contacted me directly instead of waiting.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The deadline to apply for consideration for Early Admit for the Fall 2023 semester was 01/15/2023. I see that you did not submit an application.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If you're still interested, please contact me directly at sec36@cornell.edu - don't just post here.
