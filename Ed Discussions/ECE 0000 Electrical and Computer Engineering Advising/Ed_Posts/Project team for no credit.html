  Can I participate in a project team without taking any credit from it? I would like to network and get some hands-on experience, but my regular courses already take up the maximum number of credits allowed.

  If you are referring to the 20 credit limit, the Registrar seems like they will be automatically approving overage for project teams (given that you are not also pursuing research or TA credit). Also note that project teams under ENGRG 1400/MAE 1900/MAE 4900 are now S/U exclusive starting FA22.

  You could also talk to the team and see if they offer a volunteer status. If this is your first semester participating on a project team, you must enroll in ENGRG 1400 (project team onboarding). Failure to do so may result in removal from the team.

  I do not know if this email went out to all ugrads but project teams will remain graded or S/U for 2022-2023 and all teams will be audited at the end of the school year to see if they will retain a graded status.

  Thank you.

  After I take ENGRG 1400, do I have to take 3 credits from a project team if they don't accept volunteers or I can choose between 1 and 3 credits?

  Depends on the team and what work you are specifically doing, but you could assume the latter.
