It is a great leadership opportunity to gain hands-on experience working with lab equipment (i.e. laser cutter, 3D printers, etc.), coordinating with ECE and College of Engineering admins to organize CMC events (Make-a-thon), Representing CMC/ECE at university sponsored events (i.e. Homecoming, Club Fair, ECE Day ), administering training to new lab members, and managing CMC website. The application is quick and easy, and all skill levels are welcomed.
