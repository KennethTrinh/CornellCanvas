 If I will have a B for ECE2720 by the end of the semester, should I drop it with 'w' now and take it later for a higher GPA? B will be 3.0 and this seems to be a bad GPA -- as far as I know, for comparison, the minimum cumulative entrance GPA for Cornell Meng shown in the ECE Meng page is 3.5/4.0.

 But from the other side, is a 'w' in the transcript a terrible record for graduate school or job application?

  I would only add that while the decision to drop a class with a 'W' is a personal one that only you can make, dropping a class merely because you are getting a B sounds extreme to me. One bit of information that may be relevant is that I am not slated to teach ECE 2720 again next Spring, so if you take the class again you'd have to take it with someone else.

   A couple of comments here:

     A "bad" grade is entirely subjective, and depends on the individual and what you're hoping to get out of the class. I would say many students do not consider a B to be a bad grade.

     A single grade will not "ruin" your GPA - while it has impact, it is perfectly possible to have a 3.5/4.0+ GPA with B's

     , assuming no other factors, I would stay stick with it. Trying to drop a few weeks before the end of the semester not only seems like a waste of your time and effort in the class so far, but may indicate on your transcript an element of shyness to challenges. In addition, the other thing to consider is whether you feel your ability to take the class would change, were you to take it again. ECE 2720 is a required class (assuming ECE is your major), so you'll have to take it at some point, and it doesn't seem wise to re-take the class in hopes of a better grade without a compelling reason why your circumstances would change.
     <i>
      (However, if you DO believe that you've had extenuating circumstances that have affected your ability to perform in the class, that would be something to discuss with Professor Wagner)
     </i>

   However, this seems like something that should be more of a personal conversation involving you, the professor, and your advisor, rather than something to be discussed publicly.
