 I know the list of CDEs has changed slightly from on the website. I know ECE 3250 is no longer a CDE. Is ECE 4770 (Introduction to Robotics) a CDE? It seems like a high level class that aligns with what a CDE is, but I don't see it on the list.

<p>
 If it isn't would it be possible to take it into consideration as a CDE?

  The CDE list on
  <a href="https://www.ece.cornell.edu/ece/programs/undergraduate-programs/majors/program-requirements">
   this page
  </a>
  is accurate: ECE 4770 is not a CDE. CDEs need to satisfy certain requirements in order for us to maintain our accreditation, and it is unlikely we would ever approve a cross-listed course as a CDE. This is mainly because we don't control such courses so we can't guarantee that they meet the requirements. Even if a course did meet the requirements at one point in time, the offering dept. could alter it in the future without notice to us. We also need special documentation about our CDEs, again for accreditation purposes. Never say never --- I can imagine scenarios in which this would happen, but they are atypical.

  I am hoping to add to the list of CDEs. In particular, the Fast Robots class, which has been offered as a special topics course  in the past, will become a permanent offering starting next year, and it is a natural candidate to be a CDE. Some other courses come to mind as well. But I should emphasize that I am merely describing my hopes here --- I do not get to decide unilaterally what constitutes a CDE , so I can't promise anything. As of now, the CDE list is what's on the above page.

   FYI the CDE list sits under the Upper-level ECE Electives tab on the page Professor Wagner linked above.

   I don't think it currently is a CDE unfortunately. I believe you could possibly petition to have it considered, however. But I wouldn't try to take it as a CDE until a petition gets approved
