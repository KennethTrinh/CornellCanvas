 Pretty much the title.
</p>
<p>
 I heard that the 3150+3140 are quite often taken together, but I wondered how easy the 2720+3100 combo is and if 4 ECE courses in 1 semester is absurdly unnecessary and there is no need for such rush with credits. I am also considering to drop 3150 and keep the rest in case I get too overwhelmed.
</p>
<p>
 Any advice from upperclassmen/advisors would be greatly appreciated!!
</p>
<p>
 Thank you.

  Recent graduate from ECE here... ECE 3150 is a 6-credit course in the clothes of a 4-credit course.

    It's doable - hard but definitely doable. Helps if you have a decent background in calculus and probability to make 2720/3100 more manageable

     i actually did that exact schedule last spring, but ECE 5760 instead of 2720.  i missed slope day and lost like 10% of my vision from staring at my screen too long.  It's possible but definitely a better schedule if you like waking up to pain every day

      16 credits of all ECE core will not be fun...I highly recommend dropping one of the courses (and taking an LS or OTE instead if you still need the credits).
