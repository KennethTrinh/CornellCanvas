  Is there anywhere I can get my resume reviewed by ECE faculty? I looked at COE's career center resume review sessions but I'm looking for more specific insight.

  We don't have any formal program for resume reviews. I would suggest starting with your advisor. They can offer advice and/or refer to you a colleague who is more in the area you are pursuing.
