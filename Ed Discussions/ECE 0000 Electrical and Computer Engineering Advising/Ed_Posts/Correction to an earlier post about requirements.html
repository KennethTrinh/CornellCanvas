 See #102.

 The 3000+ and 4000+ ECE Electives plus CDE must total at least 21 credits.  The ECE Web site, soon to be corrected, has said 22 instead of 21 for a while.  (Edit: Web site now corrected.)

 Apologies for this misunderstanding --- I had the rule wrong!

  I would like to claim some of the blame here. There was a misunderstanding between Prof. Delchamps and me late last Spring when the requirement that everyone must take ECE 3400 was removed. Thus the documents that I edited (the
  <a href="https://courses.cornell.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=45&amp;poid=23609">
   Courses of Study
   and the
   <link href="https://cornellengineeringhandbook.freeflowdp.com/cornellengineeringhandbook/fall2021"/>
   Engineering Handbook) differed by one credit hour from what Prof. Delchamps edited (the
   <link href="https://www.ece.cornell.edu/ece/programs/undergraduate-programs/majors/program-requirements"/>
   ECE webpage
  </a>
  ).  Sorry! I know the one credit hour does make a difference to a few people. I should have cross-checked things more thoroughly.
