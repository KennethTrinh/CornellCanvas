 Hello,
</p>
<p>
 Is there a process for my graduation checklist to be looked over before add drop ends next semester so I can make sure I will graduate with what I have filled out?
</p>
<p>
 Thanks! :)

  To follow up on this, if I am planning on graduating Fall 2022 (while concurrently enrolled in an M. Eng. what is the timeline on filling the graduation checklist and petition for early admission? (I was trying to do them now but how will I know what classes to put on either if I have 1-2 semesters before graduating?)
 </p>

  You can send it to ugrad-coordinator@ece.cornell.edu, and ECE will inspect it for you.  I do most of the inspection myself, so you could also send it to me directly, but it pays to keep the ECE Student Services office in the loop.
