  Both courses look very similar in the content that they cover (at least, from what I can tell); what courses are follow-ons/list these as prerequisites? I want to ensure I take the right one to be most prepared for the courses/areas I am most interested in.

  They're not that similar content wise. ECE 3100 is a probability theory course. This is useful if you want to take courses in machine learning and information theory (so ECE 4110, ECE 5630, CS 4780, etc)

  ECE 3250 is a signal processing course. While there are applications to machine learning and vision within signal processing, it's not exactly the same as a course in probability (at least to my understanding)

  I would just add that ECE 3250 considers basic dynamics in addition to the frequency analysis aspects of signal processing. I agree that the courses are quite different. The only real similarity is that they are both mathematical.

  Having taught both courses, I can state with confidence that they share little in common.  Your best bet: check pre-requisites for downstream courses that interest you, and plan accordingly.  FWIW if you find the signals/systems/math/ML/learning side of ECE appealing, both courses would benefit you.  Remember that extra ECE Foundation Courses count as 3000+ ECE Electives.
