 Will ECE 3150 be offered next spring? I want to be sure Iâ€™ll be able to graduate.

  The definitive answer: The chance that it is not offered in Spring 2023 is quite low. Given that it is not offered in Spring 2023, the most likely explanation is that it got moved to Fall 2022 for some reason. There are no plans to move it, but you never know.  The chance that we can't offer it (or a comparable class---perhaps it gets redesigned?) at all next academic year is extremely small, and in that case we would work with any affected students to find them a path to graduation. Honestly, if we end up in that world, 3150 might be the least of everyone's worries.

   I fully expect it to be offered.  Professor Wagner might have a more definitive answer.
