 I notice Intro to Radar Remote Sensing is no longer listed as an ECE class, but it was a few weeks ago- does it not fulfill an ECE requirement anymore? I was hoping to take it but I don't have room for a non-ECE class.

  Introduction to Radar Remote Sensing still exists as ECE 4870: see courses.cornell.edu (a.k.a. the
  <i>
   Courses of Study
  </i>
  ).
 </p>
 <p>
  It is, however, a cross-listed course from EAS. That means the course is owned and operated by EAS (as EAS 4870), but it was deemed (at least at one point in the past) to have enough ECE content for the course to appear as ECE 4870 in our roster whenever EAS chooses to offer it.
 </p>
 <p>
  EAS was indeed offering EAS 4870 in SP23 until recently, but it seems to have disappeared from the roster. As with all cross-listed courses, we have no control over when (or if) the class is offered. We don't receive warning if it is canceled.
 </p>
 <p>
  EAS 5870 is still being offered, which is strange because the catalog description says it is supposed to meet simultaneously with EAS 4870/ECE 4870. EAS might have a reason for offering one but not the other, or EAS 4870 might have been deleted by mistake, or perhaps EAS 5870 was supposed to be deleted but wasn't.

  : Could you reach out to EAS and ask what is going on with this class?

    Followup: I learned from Sharif that EAS meant to cancel this class they just neglected to cancel the 5000-level version.

   According to the 2022-23
   <i>
    Courses of Study
   </i>
   catalogue, the course exists next spring as ECE 4870.   Where did. you see the lack of cross-listing documented?

    I don't see it in the course 'Scheduler', but it used to be there as ECE 4870. Now I found EAS 5870 which has the same course name, but it no longer mentions ECE.
   </p>
   <p>
    I guess this might just be an issue with Scheduler, because I also now see it in the Catalogue.

     I think the catalogue has the final word.
