  There is ECE 5880, though that is focused on energy. Could you tell me more about the CS class you are referring to?

   I've noticed that ECE sometimes also have colloquium series. If ECE could make it as a 1 credit S/U class offered once/twice a week, that would be very helpful!

   Thanks!

    I will look into this. It obviously can't happen this semester. But perhaps for the Fall. Thank you for the suggestion.
