  Hi! I was wondering when I can expect the Fall prelim exam schedule to be finalized as I am trying to book flights for October and Thanksgiving breaks.

  I am particularly curious about ECE 3250 prelims since they are not currently listed on the

  Registrar's Fall Prelim schedule page but the posted syllabus says to expect 2 prelims.

  Thanks!

  They decide these things a full semester in advance.
