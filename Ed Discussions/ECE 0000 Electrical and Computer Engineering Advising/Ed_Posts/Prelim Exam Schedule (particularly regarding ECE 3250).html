 Hi! I was wondering when I can expect the Fall prelim exam schedule to be finalized as I am trying to book flights for October and Thanksgiving breaks.
</p>
<p>
 I am particularly curious about ECE 3250 prelims since they are not currently listed on the
 <a href="https://registrar.cornell.edu/exams/fall-prelim-exam-schedule">
  Registrar's Fall Prelim schedule
 </a>
 page but the posted syllabus says to expect 2 prelims.
</p>
<p>
 Thanks!
</p>

  The ECE 3250 prelims will take place in class periods, so they won't appear on the university schedule, which includes only evening prelims.
 </p>
 <p>
  I think the final version of the evening-prelim schedule is here:

  They decide these things a full semester in advance.
