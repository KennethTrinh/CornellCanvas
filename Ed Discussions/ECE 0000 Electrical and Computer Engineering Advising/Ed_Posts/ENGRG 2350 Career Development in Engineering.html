  I am interested in this course, but I was wondering if it counts towards any of the ECE program requirements besides Advisor-Approved Electives, such as liberal studies or OTE? Thanks!

  ENGRG 2350 is
  <link href="https://apps.engineering.cornell.edu/liberalstudies/DeniedLiberalStudies.pdf"/>
  denied by the College for use as liberal studies.

  As it is a 'career development' course and is
  <link href="https://www.ece.cornell.edu/ece/programs/undergraduate-programs/majors/program-requirements"/>
  'non-technical', I would assume that ECE would not allow it to count towards OTE either.

  Works for AAE, and that's it if the college doesn't allow it for LS.
