 I am interested in this course, but I was wondering if it counts towards any of the ECE program requirements besides Advisor-Approved Electives, such as liberal studies or OTE? Thanks!

  Works for AAE, and that's it if the college doesn't allow it for LS.

   ENGRG 2350 is
   <a href="https://apps.engineering.cornell.edu/liberalstudies/DeniedLiberalStudies.pdf">
    denied
    by the College for use as liberal studies.
   </a>
  </p>
  <p>
   As it is a 'career development' course and is
   <link href="https://www.ece.cornell.edu/ece/programs/undergraduate-programs/majors/program-requirements"/>
   'non-technical'
   , I would assume that ECE would not allow it to count towards OTE either.
