  2 favorites of mine have been CS 2850 and LING 1101. 2850 is all about networks; reasoning is relatively simple, but has a bunch of cool applications. Unfortunately, had to drop LING 1101 this semester because I had too much of a workload, but it seemed really interesting (about how we perceive language differently) - will be taking next semester!

  You could also consider taking a 3-credit LS course alongside the 1-credit course AMST 2001: The First American University!
