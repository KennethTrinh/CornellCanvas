 Hi!
</p>
<p>
 Since Fast Robots is housed in ECE but is cross listed with MAE, can it count as an OTE?
</p>
<p>
 Thanks!

  But that one ECE course needs to be interpretable as "outside your major disciplinary area," which we can often retro-fit to make it work.

   Per Prof. Delchamps, you are allowed "one course with ECE as it's home department to count towards OTE".

   See #54 and #90.
