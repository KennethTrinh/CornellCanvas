  Hi!
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Since Fast Robots is housed in ECE but is cross listed with MAE, can it count as an OTE?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thanks!

  Per Prof. Delchamps, you are allowed "one course with ECE as it's home department to count towards OTE".

  See #54 and #90.

  But that one ECE course needs to be interpretable as "outside your major disciplinary area," which we can often retro-fit to make it work.
