 I would like to make all students interested in ECE aware of a recently developed course: ECE 2400 / ENGRD 2140 Computer Systems Programming. I have included the course announcement below. While not required for ECE students, this course is a perfect choice for your second ENGRD especially if you are interested in computer engineering.
 <b>
  If you are looking for an intermediate programming course after taking CS 1110/1112, but you want something a bit more tailored to ECE students compared to CS 2110, then this is the course for you!
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 If you are an upperclassman majoring in ECE and already took CS 2110, then you still might find this course a great complement since you will have a chance to delve deeper into low-level systems details and better understand the connection between software and hardware. You can also potentially count it as an outside-ECE technical elective or if nothing else as an advisor approved elective. The course usually includes a mix of sophomores, juniors, and seniors.
</p>
<p>
 This course is great preparation for ECE 3400, ECE 3140, ECE 4750, ECE 4760, CS 4110, and other advanced courses in embedded systems, operating systems, databases, compilers, high-performance computing, etc. where C and C++ are the languages of choice.
</p>

 Lots more information on the course webpage (

  ). Happy to answer any questions students might have about this course here on Ed!

<p>
 The School of Electrical and Computer Engineering would like to announce its course in computer systems programming, to be offered this Fall 2022.
</p>
<p>
 This course is perfect for students in any major wishing to include a more performance-oriented software programming component in their undergraduate studies. This is also the recommended ENGRD for ECE students interested in computer engineering. While taking CS 2110 is the preferred option for CS majors, you can take this course instead of CS 2110 if you are planning to minor or double major in CS.
</p>
<p>
 Learn how to use C/C++ to develop data structures and algorithms that are both high performance and efficient. Learn the low-level details ”beneath” Python/MATLAB (e.g., static types, stack, pointers, dynamic memory management) and how to use high-level programming paradigms (e.g., object-oriented, generic, functional, concurrent programming).
</p>
<p>
 The course includes a series of five programming assignments. Students will gain experience with UNIX software development including command line development tools, distributed version control, unit testing frameworks, continuous integration, debugging tools, and performance optimization. In the final two programming assignments, students will work in pairs to design, implement, test, and evaluate a high-performance handwriting recognition system to automatically classify handwritten letters.

   TLDR: ECE 2400 rocks!  Carpe diem and take it while you can!

    Hi,
   </p>
   <p>
    If I am intending to use this class to fulfill my miscellaneous ENGRD requirement, do I have to enroll in ENGRD 2140? Or would enrolling in ECE 2400 also be acceptable? Thank you.
   </p>

     Great question ... I think the exact course number doesn't matter but it can't hurt to enroll in the ENGRD 2140 course number.

      In general, ECE does not care what version of cross-listed class you enroll in. They are the same class after all!

     Hi,
    </p>
    <p>
     I was wondering as a prospective ECE major and CS minor if CS 2110 or ECE 2400 would be the more beneficial course, given that I plan on taking higher level CS courses in the future? Would I be at a disadvantage for CS 3110 or 3410 having taken ECE 2400 instead of CS 2110?
    </p>
    <p>
     Thank you!
    </p>

      You should know that if you are trying to double count more things, you would want to take ECE 3140 / CS 3420 instead of CS 3410. Learning C in ECE 2400 is definitely beneficial for both options regardless.

       Great question! We strongly encourage all ECE majors to take ECE 2400 even if they are minoring in CS or even double majoring in ECE+CS. ECE 2400 is much more oriented towards what ECE students really need to know in upper-level computer engineering course work (ECE 3140, ECE 4750, ECE 4760, etc) . At the same time, students that take ECE 2400 will be well prepared for higher-level CS courses such as CS 3110 and CS 3410. In fact, students that take ECE 2400 might even be
       <underline>
        more
       </underline>
       prepared for CS systems courses like CS 3410 that use C/C++. But don't just take it from me ... here is a quote from a student course evaluation from a prior offering of ECE 2400: "Content was very useful for CS (if not more beneficial than 2110). As a CS Major, I would rather take this course instead of 2110; much more practical and well thought out." CS 2110 does have its own benefits though especially for students that really want to learn Java or for students that want to be more embedded into the CS community. Hope this helps!
