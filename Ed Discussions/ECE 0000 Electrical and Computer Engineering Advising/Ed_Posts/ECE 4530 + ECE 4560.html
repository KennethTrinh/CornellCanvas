  Anyone know whether or not this workload is doable? (ie. How are the homeworks &amp; labs for each of the corresponding class, pros and cons of taking one over the other, and if doing both together is ambitious, which one would people recommend)

  It strongly depends on what else you plan on taking that semester.

  I was likely thinking of taking ECE 4750, a liberal and a business minor requirement. With these classes, how manageable do you think those 3 ECE courses would be together?

  That context greatly changes things, that's a hefty &gt;=18 credits you are taking. Both Analog IC and Comp Arch are intensive CDEs and wouldn't suggest taking both at the same time (unless all of your other courses are very chill).
