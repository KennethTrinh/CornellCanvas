  Now that ECE 2200 is no longer being offered, will there be any plans to change the curriculum of ECE 3250 in future offerings? And if the course does change, what would be the anticipated changes to the curriculum? Thanks!

  I'll teach a revised version of ECE 3250 next fall.  I can send you the syllabus if you e-mail me.  I chopped some stuff out of the current/past 3250 and inserted some stuff to make up for the fact that incoming students won't have played around with signals and spectra and stuff previously.

  More broadly, the plan is for ECE 3250 is to become a junior-level first course in signals, systems, and related topics. So the course will remain in the catalog, and it will remain a foundation class, but it will no longer have ECE 2200 (which no longer exists) as a prereq. Upper-division courses will continue to list ECE 3250 as a prereq as appropriate.
