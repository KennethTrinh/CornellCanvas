 If I took 2200, and am taking 3400 this semester, can it count as an upper elective?

  You can.   The 2200 ---&gt; 2720 change was independent of the 3400 change.

   Can you clarify what the 3400 change was?

    ECE 3400 was required and now is not required of any student who hasn't taken it yet.
   </p>
   <p>
    When ECE 3400 was required, ECE's upper-level elective requirements called for two 3000+ ECE electives.  With ECE 3400 no longer required, ECE's upper-level elective requirements call for three 3000+ ECE electives.
