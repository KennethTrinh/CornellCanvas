  You can.   The 2200 ---&gt; 2720 change was independent of the 3400 change.

  ECE 3400 was required and now is not required of any student who hasn't taken it yet.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  When ECE 3400 was required, ECE's upper-level elective requirements called for two 3000+ ECE electives.  With ECE 3400 no longer required, ECE's upper-level elective requirements call for three 3000+ ECE electives.
