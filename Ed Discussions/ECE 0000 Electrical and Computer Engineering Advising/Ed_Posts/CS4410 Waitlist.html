 Have there been any updates on #232 ?
</p>
<p>
 As an ECE, I really want to take CS4410 during the fall since it sounds very applicable and it will allow me to take other interesting CS classes like System Security (5430) and Cloud Computing (5412) in the future. These all seem like very useful classes for ECEs and the topics that are taught in this class have been mentioned in many of my ECE classes.
</p>
<p>
 I was wondering if there have been updates on the possibility for ECEs to get priority when they are in the waitlist (after CS student, of course).

  No --- that would be a heavy lift. And do we really expect that it would make a difference for ECE students to have priority over other non-CS majors in CS 4410? I imagine the enrollment in CS 4410 would be mostly CS with some ECE and then a smattering of other majors. I wouldn't expect many OR, IS, or MechE students to be interested in the class, for instance. If that's the case then it wouldn't make much difference whether ECE students have priority over those majors.
