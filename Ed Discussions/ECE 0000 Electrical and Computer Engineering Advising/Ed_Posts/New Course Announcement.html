  I'd like to call your attention to a late addition to the Fall 2022 course roster: ECE 4960, Special Topics in Electrical and Computer Engineering: CMOS Integrated Sensors, Actuators and Circuits.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Here is a short description:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  "Sensors and Actuators are integrated directly on CMOS wafers and are
  <break>
  </break>
  controlled by CMOS circuits. This class will describe MEMS-CMOS integration
  <break>
  </break>
  approaches for electrostatic and piezoelectric devices. Circuit design for
  <break>
  </break>
  managing sensors with respect to increasing stability, linearity, and SNR will
  <break>
  </break>
  be covered. Interface circuits such as ADCs and DACs will be covered in the
  <break>
  </break>
  context of noise added to the sensor signals."
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I'm expecting that a graduate version will be added to the roster as well. If you are interested in the graduate version, you can enroll in ECE 4960 now to reserve a spot and then move to the graduate version when it is created.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For more information about the content of the course, contact the instructor, Prof. Lal. For logistical questions about the expected graduate version, please contact me.
