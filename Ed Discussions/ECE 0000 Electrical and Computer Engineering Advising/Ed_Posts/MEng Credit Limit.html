 Does the ECE MEng have a credit limit like in undergrad? If so, is it also 20 credits?

  Yes, it is the same exact credit hour limit as undergraduates - no more than 20 credit hours in a given semester.

  You can always petition to enroll in more, same as undergraduate, but there's always the possibility of being told no.

  The more straight forward answer is the MEng credit hour enrollment is 20 credit hours.
