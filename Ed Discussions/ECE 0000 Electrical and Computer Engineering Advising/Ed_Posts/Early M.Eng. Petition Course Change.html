 Due to add/drop, I've decided to change one of the courses I listed in the Final Semester Plan in the MEng Petition as I felt this matched my interests and direction of my MEng more. Is this okay, and if so, how should I update the ECE department on this change?

  For Early Admits, I reach out to them during their first week or two of the semester that they actually enroll in the MEng program and send a copy of their original Early Admit Petition, along with a blank copy of the form.
 </p>
 <p>
  I ask them to review it, and if there are changes (there almost always are to some degree), I ask to have them submit an updated copy, so I know for certain what they took in their Early ADmit semester. Then, I will know what to reference when checking if they've met degree requirements, when it comes to graduation.

   Please send Sharif an updated Graduation Checklist and describe the change (sounds as if it was only one course) so he and I can handle it efficiently.

   I don't think you need to let the M.Eng. folks know about the change --- their main concern is that you finish your undergrad by completing 1-8 credits during your "Early M.Eng. semester."  How exactly you do that is more Sharif's and my concern.
