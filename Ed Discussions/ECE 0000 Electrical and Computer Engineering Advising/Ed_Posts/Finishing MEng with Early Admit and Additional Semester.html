  I've heard that some people try to finish their MEng degree by taking one semester in the Early Admit program in undergrad and one additional semester in the MEng program. I was wondering what the logistics of this are like? With the 30 credit requirement for the degree, it seems that they would have to take 8 credits towards the MEng in their Early Admit semester and 22 credits during the additional semester, but wouldn't this go over the 20 credit limit?

  Edit: I made a mistake and thought we had to take 1-8 credits of MEng classes, instead of 1-8 credits of undergraduate classes in the final semester. This makes much more sense now, thank you!

  People routinely take more than 8 credits toward their M.Eng. during the early-admit semester.  Often they strategize to leave just a tiny shred of undergrad to finish up --- like 1 credit of technical writing --- and fill out the rest of their early-admit-semester schedules with M.Eng. courses.

  Yes, this is potentially possible, and has become more common in the last several years.

  Typically, students who are able to make this work, have arranged their course schedule in advance, so in their final semester of enrollment as an Undergraduate (i.e. the Early Admit semester), they not only meet the criteria to be considered for the Early Admit Option (specifically, 8 or fewer credit hours left in the final semester of Undergraduate enrollment), they leave as few credit hours as possible.

  In most cases, students leave only a handful of credit hours, so that they can frontload in usually the equivalent of roughly half of their MEng degree requirements. Then, when they actually matriculate as an actual MEng Student, they only need to be enrolled for one semester in order to be eligible to graduate and complete their MEng degree requirements.

  If you're considering this, the best thing to do would be to contact me directly at sec36@cornell.edu, and/or come see me in person in 223 PH.
