  Two sections of this active course are offered- one in-person and one asynchronous- so you can fit it in your busy schedule!
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Please note that asynchronous does NOT mean non-interactive. You will interact with other students and the instructor at times of mutual convenience. The asynchronous course does take time management skills and self-discipline, so it may not be the best fit for students who have struggled with that in the past. For that reason, some students might be better served in the in-person section.
