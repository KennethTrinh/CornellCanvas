  I’m really interested in taking MAE 4220 - Introduction to Internet of things - Technology and Engagement but it seems to be under regarded as an MAE class now. The last time it was offered, Spring 2021, it was cross-listed with ECE4950 as special topics in ECE. I was wondering if I took this as an ECE elective in the future whether it would count despite it being an MAE class or I would have to petition it. I mean nothing screams ECE like a class on IOT (right?!) Also, I wanted to know if this would be offered in Fall 2022.

  Since ECE cross-listed the course in the past, if Professor Max Zhang, the instructor, asked ECE to cross-list it, I'd imagine ECE would be inclined to go for it.  In the absence of cross-listing, yeah, you'd need to petition to count it as Upper-level ECE Elective.  If you went that route, it would pay to lay heavy emphasis on the former cross-listing bit.
