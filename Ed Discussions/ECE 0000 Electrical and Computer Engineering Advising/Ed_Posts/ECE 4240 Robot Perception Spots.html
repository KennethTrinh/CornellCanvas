  Have the spots for ECE 4240 also been similarly filled up by Grad students? Because I tried to pre-enroll just now and it was instantly filled.

  At this point, the class is full so unless students drop and spots become open, it's recommended that you check back during Add/Drop as there tends to be more movement with enrollment at that time.

  ECE 4240 is a cross-list from MAE. You can see this by noting that the
  <link href="https://courses.cornell.edu/content.php?filter%5B27%5D=ECE&amp;filter%5B29%5D=4240&amp;filter%5Bcourse_type%5D=-1&amp;filter%5Bkeyword%5D=&amp;filter%5B32%5D=1&amp;filter%5Bcpage%5D=1&amp;cur_cat_oid=52&amp;expand=&amp;navoid=21314&amp;search_database=Filter#acalog_template_course_filter"/>
  catalog description just refers you to MAE 4810.  So we have no control over the class. Nor can we see who is enrolled. I can see the number of students enrolled as of the snapshot taken last night, and it showed the class as half full. So to answer your question I would guess it is about half graduate students and half seniors.
