  A few months ago, I saw ECE 4240 on FA22 roster and planned to take it for the robotics minor. However, I just noticed that it's not offered in FA22 and the new handbook doesn't list it as a fundamental course of robotics. Is this course not offered any longer or only in FA22?

  ECE 4240 is a cross-listed course from Mechanical Engineering. You can tell because the
  <link href="https://courses.cornell.edu/content.php?filter%5B27%5D=ECE&amp;filter%5B29%5D=4240&amp;filter%5Bcourse_type%5D=-1&amp;filter%5Bkeyword%5D=&amp;filter%5B32%5D=1&amp;filter%5Bcpage%5D=1&amp;cur_cat_oid=52&amp;expand=&amp;navoid=21314&amp;search_database=Filter#acalog_template_course_filter"/>
  catalog description says "For description, see MAE 4810." This means that it is basically an MAE class (MAE 4810) that is deemed to have enough ECE content that whenever MAE decides to offer it, it appears automatically in our roster as an ECE class. This is so that our students can count it toward ECE graduation requirements without having to petition.

 <paragraph>
  The upshot is that we have no say or insight into when this class is offered. It is entirely up to MAE.

  This Ed Discussion was originally inspired by a similar site set up by Prof. Kirby for MAE. On the MAE site, Prof. Kirby posted the following recently [text is square brackets is my addition]
 </paragraph>
 <blockquote>
  "hello all --
 </blockquote>
 <blockquote>
  MAE4810, which was originally planned to be taught in F22, is being moved to S23. Apologies to all affected. @Kae-Lynn [Kae-Lynn Buchanan Wilson, one of MAE's undergraduate coordinators] will be sending out emails to enrolled students to make sure they are aware.
 </blockquote>
 <blockquote>
  I don't want to preempt announcements that are the purview of others to announce, but just so you know why this is happening: prof ferrari [the instructor for MAE 4810] will be taking on an exciting new role in the college, which I think will be announced by the dean shortly (next week?). This new role requires that we move the term in which 4810 is taught."
 </blockquote>
 <paragraph>
  I just consulted the 2020, 2021, 2022 editions of the handbooks, and none of them list MAE 4810 (or ECE 4240) as part of the robotics minor. When you say the new handbook doesn't list ECE 4240, are you indicating that the older editions did? If so, could you point me to where?

  Thank you so much for the info.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I actually saw that MAE 4810 counts as a robotics course on the
  <link href="https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/students/undergraduate-students/curriculum/majors-and-minors/robotics-minor"/>
  robotics minor website. This is one of the few discrepancies between the handbook and the website, but I guess the website is correct because the course seems closely related to robotics. What is your opinion on this?

  Actually, the Courses of Study (courses.cornell.edu) is generally considered the most authoritative statement of requirements, then the handbook, with college and dept. websites being last. The websites are not vetted by as many people, and they can be changed at any point, with no (guaranteed) option to access the old version. In contrast, the Courses of Study is checked by more people, and it is published once per year, with all previous versions being available so you can always see the requirements that were in effect when you entered, which is what matters to you.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  In this case, MAE 4810 is actually listed in the courses of study, so it counts toward the minor. The problem is that it isn't listed in the handbook. I'll point this out to people who manage the minor. Thanks for pointing this out.

  Is there a way for ECEs interested in MAE classes to join the MAE Canvas/Ed?

  From the MAE Canvas site:
 </paragraph>
 <blockquote>
  ... if you want to tell someone else how to get access to ME UG canvas and Ed, let them know that they are supposed to be able to register for ME UG canvas by going to the link
  <bold>
   <link href="https://canvas.cornell.edu/enroll/8AWWCT"/>
   https://canvas.cornell.edu/enroll/8AWWCT.
  </bold>
  Then they can get into Ed. If that link doesn't work (people sometimes say that it doesn't work, I have no idea, whatever), they can contact
  <link href="mailto:mae_undergrad@cornell.edu"/>
  mae_undergrad@cornell.edu to ask the UPO to manually invite them to the canvas site. @Kae-Lynn @Ashley holler if you recommend a different process.
 </blockquote>
 <paragraph>
  You can probably also find the site by searching within Canvas.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  This site is likewise open to everyone. The "Welcome to ECE" announcement on the Canvas side has a link that you are welcome to share with people who want to join. We issue explicit invitations to students when they affiliate with ECE. Also some unaffiliated students who indicate a particular interest in ECE to the advising office.
