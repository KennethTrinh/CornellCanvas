  I haven't taken ECE 3100, which is a listed pre-requisite for this course. What counts as "a strong familiarity with discrete probability"?

  Tough to give that vague prescription focus .... I'm thinking, everything you learn in a typical probability course like ECE 3100 before you hit densities and distributions for continuous-valued random variables.  You know, stuff like conditional probability for discrete-valued random variables, not simply stuff like, "you have three coins with these probabilities of heads, you flip them all independently, what's the probability all come up tails?"
