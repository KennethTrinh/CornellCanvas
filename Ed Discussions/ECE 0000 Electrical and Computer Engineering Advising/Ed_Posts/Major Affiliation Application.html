  I'm a sophomore, and I applied for major affiliation a couple days into the semester back in January but I haven't heard anything back yet. Are these applications only reviewed at the end of the semester or should I be concerned? Thanks.

  Most applications that arrived in late January or after got put in a folder to be reviewed at semesters end.  If your application is ready for review, I can pull it out and process it quickly.

  It is ready for review, but I don't think there would be any particular reason I would need it to be processed right away. I just wanted to check. Thanks.
