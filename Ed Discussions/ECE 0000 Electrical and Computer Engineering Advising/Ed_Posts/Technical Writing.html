  Hi, I took ENGRD 2110 (CS 2110) to get counted as ENGRD credit and to fulfill CS minor requirement. But does ENGRD 2110 also count for technical writing? I am not sure if it can overlap. Thank you.

  Sorry, I meant advanced programming instead of technical writing.

  ... and Yes, taking CS 2110 as ENGRD class kills off the advanced programming simultaneously.

  I wonder if CS 2110 might be able to kill off ENGRD, advanced programming, AND count as 3 credits of OTE?

  Unfortunately, you can't use one course to satisfy both of those requirements simultaneously.
