  I saw these two classes (ENGRG 4900 and ENGRG 4990) on the list of approved liberal studies courses. Thus I wanted to ask whether being a TA or a project team lead could count as a liberal studies credit.

  The College of Engineering handles liberal-studies approval.  I suggest you pose your question to Engineering Advising.

  FWIW ECE at least up to now has told students they can count TA-ing-for-credit only as Advisor-approved Elective.  To my knowledge no student has raised the question about project-team lead for LS.
