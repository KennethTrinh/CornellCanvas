 I apologize for this question as it's an CoE question, i just could not find answer elsewhere.

 I'm a international student who transfer from UIUC as a sophomore last year. I recently read the financial aid web page and find international students are eligible only if we declared that we need financial aid when we apply for Cornell. I forgot if I did so, where can I check this?

  You really should be contacting the Financial Aid Office directly about this. Or, even better, go in person to speak to someone. They would be your best resource.
