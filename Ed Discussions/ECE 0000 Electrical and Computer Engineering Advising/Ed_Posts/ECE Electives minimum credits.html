  Sorry if this is a trivial question.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For the 6 ECE technical electives, Fall 2021 Engineering Handbook says that a minimum of 21 credits is required, while ECE requirements website says the minimum is 22. Which one should I follow?

  22 is correct.

  Edit: 21 is correct.  This was a surprise to me.  We'll need to correct the ECE Web page.
