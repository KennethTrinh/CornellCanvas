  Hi all,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I just wanted to get a quick clarification on one of the descriptions for the Upper-Level ECE Electives:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  "CS 4120 and CS 4410, along with their associated practica, are acceptable as 4000-level ECE technical electives"
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I just wanted to clarify how this should be interpreted, either:
 </paragraph>
 <list style="number">
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    If I take CS 4410 and the associated practica, they both qualify as upper-level ECE electives, fulfilling 2 of the 6 required
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    If I take CS 4410 and the associated practica, the combination of the two qualify as a single upper-level ECE elective, fulfilling 1 of the 6 required
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
 </list>
 <paragraph>
  Thanks!

  You can always count it as you describe in 2.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  You can count it as you describe in 1 if when you count it that way the total of credit hours over CDE plus 4000+ ECE plus 3000+ ECE on your Checklist is at least 21.
