  For students entering 2019 and earlier, one of the liberal studies requirements is to take "At least six courses chosen from at least three of the thirteen categories listed below". If we take one course that has multiple distribution categories, do all the categories count towards that requirement or just one? For example, if we take one course that is SBA and SSC does that one course satisfy 2/3 or just 1/3 of the requirement?

  Hello! Just one category per course would count, but if the course has multiple categories designated, you get to choose which one to use.  So, for ECON 1120, for example, it is designated as SSC and SBA.  You get to choose whether to use it for SSC or SBA.  This comes in handy if you already have another course counting as SBA and if you still need a different category for the requirement.
