  Hi, I was wondering if CS 2110 fulfills both the advanced programming requirement and the ENGRD requirement simultaneously? That is, I can "double dip" in terms of using that class for both requirements?

  Yes. The very definition of a "checkoff" is that you can check off that requirement with a class that is also used to satisfy some other requirement. Regular (non-checkoff) requirements need credit hours, so a given class can satisfy at most one of them.

  Separate from all that, as an ECE student you might find ECE 2400 more useful than CS 2110. ECE 2400 also satisfies both the ENGRD requirement and the advanced programming requirement.
