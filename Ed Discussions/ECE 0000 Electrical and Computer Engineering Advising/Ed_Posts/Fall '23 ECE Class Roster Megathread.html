 Attached is a PDF of the FA23 ECE class roster. Thanks to Ronin Sharma and especially Aidan McNay, the roster now has a calendar view on the first page. It also combines the listing of co-meeting classes and has a few other improvements.
</p>
<p>
 There are several special topics offerings that are new for next semester:
</p>
<list style="bullet">
 <li>
  <p>
   ECE 4950:
   <i>
    Sensor Design
   </i>
   with Prof. El-Ghazaly
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   ECE 4950:
   <i>
    Quantum Information Science: Communication and Computation
   </i>
   with Prof. Wilde
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   ECE 6950:
   <i>
    Atomic and Quantum Optical Physics and Technology
   </i>
   with Prof. Mehta
  </p>
 </li>
</list>
<p>
 In addition, we are offering ECE 4330: Microwave Theory, Devices, and Applications (which will be renamed to Microwave Circuit Design when the catalog is updated) with Prof. Ibrahim. ECE 4330 is not technically a new class, but it has not been offered in a while, and Prof. Ibrahim is revamping it. So it feels new.
</p>
<p>
 There is a mandate from the College and the Registrar that all departments spread their courses out over the day and week. With larger incoming student classes, there simply aren't enough classrooms to go around otherwise. So you'll notice more 8 a.m., 9 a.m.,  8:40 a.m., and evening classes across all departments, including ECE. One side benefit of this is fewer class conflicts.
</p>
<p>
 Re: conflicts, bear in mind that moving classes around inevitably creates new conflicts even as it eliminates others. If you see a conflict that will prevent students from graduating on time or that you expect will impact a large number of students, please do bring it to my attention. We are not technically allowed to change the roster at this point, but I'm sure we can do so if there is a serious problem. But the bar is pretty high.
</p>
<p>
 I had hopes to post this earlier, along with a survey of which classes people wish to enroll in. We would then schedule classes to eliminate the conflicts as identified in the survey. That didn't happen this round for a variety of reasons. Hopefully in the fall.

  ECE 4450 is showing up as 3 credits on the class roster and Student Center. Is this an issue or is there a modification being made to the course?

   The latter. The University is enforcing credit hour rules more strictly now, and we had to take several courses down to 3 credit hours. Basically any course that is lecture-only with no discussion or lab needs to be 3 credits rather than 4.

    Does this also apply to the xlist 5000 offering? That one still shows as 4 credits.

     It was supposed to, yes. The 4 credits is an error, but now that students have enrolled I don't think we can (or should) change it. Sorry for the confusion.

      Just talked to the registrar, and they said we have to lower both ECE 5660 and ECE 5750 to 3 credits. That is happening now and Sharif will be contacting the students already enrolled in those courses. Sorry for the mixup.

   I just noticed there is no ECE 3400 offering. Is it being phased out? Or just offered in some future semester TBD?

    I was looking at classes and saw that one of the sections for ECE 5960 is micro/nanorobots. This class sounds really cool, but there is no course description/pre-reqs/syllabus talking about what the course will cover. Has anyone taken this class or has a more detailed description of this course?

     For ECE 6950 (Reconfigurable Computing and FPGA Design) the Cornell Tech section says that Master's students will be considered but does this also apply to the Distance Learning Section?

      Potentially, but because this is going to be streamed from CT it's going to be in an ECE conference room, not a regular classroom. So space will be limited and Ph.D. students, for whom this class is intended, will have priority. You can reach out to the instructor after pre-enroll, but he might insist on waiting until add-drop in the fall so that the incoming Ph.D. students have a chance to enroll.

       We will likely have a graduate co-meeting section. I don't know if it will be in place for pre-enroll next week.

       Out of curiosity, is there any hope of return for ECE 2400? As a former student of the course, I am saddened to not see it being offered :(

          ECE 4240 is a cross-list from MAE. They would need to decide to offer a 5000-level version and have it cross-listed as ECE. I suggest reaching out to the instructor.

          I see on student center that there are two sections of 5960: One for sensor Design and one for Micro and Nano Robots. I was hoping to do both courses. Is that possible?

             Will the ECE 4950 sections be cross-listed to the 5000-level? And will syllabi be made available for these new courses? (looks like we don't have access to the FA23 classes.cornell.edu site)
            </p>
            <p>
             More of a behind the scenes question: is there a reason behind ECE using the 4950 code vs. 4960 code in different special topics courses in different semesters?
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, while this is a ugrad Ed, it seems that no incoming MEng students will be able to enroll in ECE 5250 due to the conflict with ECE 5010 (unless that is something that can get worked out on a case-by-case basis with Scott).

              For sensor design, no. For quantum information science, uncertain but more likely than not.

              The classes.cornell.edu site for FA23 is indeed not public yet. ECE has no control over that.
             </p>
             <p>
              Re: special topics numbering, ECE used to place different special topics courses offered during a given semester under different numbers (ECE 4950, 4960, etc.) to avoid confusion.  The registrar told us it is a best practice to list them all as sections of one course number. In my experience, this tends to create confusion both for them and for us, but there are probably reasons to do it this way. I expect that over time the other numbers like 4960, etc., will disappear from the catalog completely.
             </p>
             <p>
              Re: 5250 and 5010, correct. But it is hard to find a time for 5010 that doesn't conflict with any 5000-level course and meets various other constraints. For the case of 5250 and 5010, you might be able to work something out with the instructors. 5010 is only 7 weeks, and it only conflicts with the 5250 discussion.
             </p>

                I now see Sensor Design now cross-listed as 5960 on Student Center. Could you confirm if this is indeed a real ECE offering or just an artifact?
