 Hello! Are there any pre-requisites for ECE 5412:
 <a href="https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/SP23/class/ECE/5412">
  Bayesian Estimation and Stochastic Optimization
 </a>
 ? Seems like a cool course but there's no syllabus or pre-requisites listed and I'm sure there are a few.
</p>

  to have strong background in elementary undergraduate probability/random processes (random variables, moments, finite state Markov chains), signals and systems (state space models, difference equations, stability), and undergraduate linear algebra (singular values, positive definite matrices)
