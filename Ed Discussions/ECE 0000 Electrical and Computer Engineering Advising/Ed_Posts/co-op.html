  If I'm doing a co-op next semester, do I need to do the thing where I bump the year+sem thing up (so that in fall 2023 I will be a first semester senior as opposed to a second semester junior) or does it go automatically?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Also, am I still able to pre-enroll next semester?

  You don't need to do the thing to bump your year. You are also able to pre-enroll next semester when you are in a co-op. I have done two co-ops so if you have any more question you can comment to this post.
