  I know that a lot of MS students pay a large part of their tuition by being a TA (or at least that's how it was when my parents were here). Is there something similar for MEng students? I know as an undergrad, getting paid as a TA is essentially minimum wage. Are MEng TAs paid closer to undergrads or MS students?

  M.Eng. TAs get a stipend, currently about $7200 per semester, which is way more than undergrad TAs make but way less than M.S./Ph.D. TAs make.

  If you TA two classes, does the stipend double?

  I don't know whether M.Eng. students are allowed to TA two classes.

  To the best of my knowledge, there is nothing preventing a student from serving as an MEng GTRS (Graduate Teaching Research Specialist - they're no longer called "TA") for more than one course.

  ECE would very likely not appoint one student to two separate courses.

  There is no tuition or health insurance support offered.
