  When are people who did early admit MEng last semester supposed to enroll for Fall 2022? In the spring we were told that we couldn't pre-enroll with the other grad students/seniors because we were graduating and that we would have to enroll in the summer with other incoming students. Incoming freshmen pre-enrolled last week, so I was wondering when we would be able to enroll.

  Becaus you have graduated, and are now returning to enroll in a brand new degree program, you are now considered a new incoming student.

  As a result, you will be able to enroll starting on August 15th, when the STudent Center opens for add/drop for the fall semester.
