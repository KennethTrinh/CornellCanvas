  I will be working as a part time intern in the spring semester. I start in January, but I want to put it on my resume now because I want to apply for summer internships (I cannot work at this company during the summer). Is this possible/how would I go about that?

  For what it's worth, I think your proposal is totally reasonable. I've done something like that myself multiple times.

  Another data point: it is not uncommon for new faculty hires at Cornell to defer their start date by up to a year in order to finish out a postdoc, industry gig, etc. At the same time, they want to advertise their affiliation with Cornell. So they do something like what you are proposing in their CV and on their webpage.
