 I've never TA'd before. Is there somewhere where I can read how the process works?

  If there is a course or courses you're interested in serving as a Ugrad TA for, reach out directly to the instructor of the course. It would likely serve you (and them) better if you've previously taken the course and earned a higher grade in it; this may also increase the likelihood of you being considered, as it shows you are familiar with the material.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instructors self-select their own Ugrad TAs. Each course has a budget in terms of available hours to devote towards appointing Ugrad TAs, so it can be a finite amount. If you're motivated to do this, act now.

  Pay is an hourly rate. If I am not mistaken, it's $12 an hour.
