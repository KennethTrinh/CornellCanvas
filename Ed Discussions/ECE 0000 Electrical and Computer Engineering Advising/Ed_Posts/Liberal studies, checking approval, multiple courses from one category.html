  I am a sophomore/rising junior, and had a few questions about liberal studies:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I'm currently taking a course (PLBIO 2400) for liberal studies during this summer session, and I wanted to double-check that it counts for liberal studies. I saw that it has been approved for the CA category on this webpage:
  <link href="https://apps.engineering.cornell.edu/liberalstudies/ApprovedLiberalStudies.pdf"/>
  https://apps.engineering.cornell.edu/liberalstudies/ApprovedLiberalStudies.pdf
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If this spreadsheet marks a course as approved, is there nothing else I need to check for being able to count a certain course for liberal studies?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Secondly, I know that the liberal studies requirement has 6 "groups," as this webpage lists:
  <link href="https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/students/undergraduate-students/advising/liberal-studies/liberal-studies-policy-students-entering"/>
  https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/students/undergraduate-students/advising/liberal-studies/liberal-studies-policy-students-entering
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Can I take two (or more) courses from the same liberal studies category, as long as three courses come from three different groups, and excluding the Communications in Engineering (CE) category (as the webpage describes the requirements)?

  Once a course hits the approved list, no need for you to do anything special to have to count for LS.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  And yes, you can take multiple courses from a single LS category.
