 I know it was brought up in a few past threads a while back that ECE 4200 might not be offered this upcoming Spring. I see that it's listed in the roster as of now and wanted to make sure that it's actually being offered.

  I was not expecting us to be able to offer ECE 4200 this academic year, but we had a last minute staffing change that allows us to offer it in the Spring.
 </p>
 <p>
  I am expecting it to be offered again in the Fall and to become a Fall course thereafter.

  Sorry for not announcing this earlier and for not replying to this post until now.

   As of right now, it's on the roster and will be available for pre-enroll for the spring.

    Last I heard in September it wasn't happening next spring.  Seeing it on the roster surprises me.  A higher authority will no doubt be able to provide some clarity.  Please stay tuned.

    Edit: we have the answer!  Great news!
