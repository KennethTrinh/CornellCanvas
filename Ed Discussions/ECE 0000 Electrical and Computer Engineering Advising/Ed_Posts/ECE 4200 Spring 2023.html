  I know it was brought up in a few past threads a while back that ECE 4200 might not be offered this upcoming Spring. I see that it's listed in the roster as of now and wanted to make sure that it's actually being offered.

  Last I heard in September it wasn't happening next spring.  Seeing it on the roster surprises me.  A higher authority will no doubt be able to provide some clarity.  Please stay tuned.

  Edit: we have the answer!  Great news!

  As of right now, it's on the roster and will be available for pre-enroll for the spring.

  I was not expecting us to be able to offer ECE 4200 this academic year, but we had a last minute staffing change that allows us to offer it in the Spring.

  I am expecting it to be offered again in the Fall and to become a Fall course thereafter.

  Sorry for not announcing this earlier and for not replying to this post until now.
