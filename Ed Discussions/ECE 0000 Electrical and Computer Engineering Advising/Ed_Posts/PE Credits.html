 Do PE credits count towards the credit maximum? If so, how hard would it be to petition an additional credit for PE?

   the petition form

  , but I think it wouldn't be hard to petition an additional credit for PE?

   Yes, I think so. My understanding is that the college doesn't want PE credits to count, but the registrar has a practical problem that they can't configure student center to limit credits to 20 excepting PE (and whatever other exceptions apply). So the 20 credit hour limit gets applied across the board and you have to petition them to add PE.
