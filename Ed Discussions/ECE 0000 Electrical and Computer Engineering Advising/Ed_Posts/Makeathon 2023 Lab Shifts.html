  Hey everyone! Maker Club is hosting Makeathon this year from 12:00 PM on March 25th to 12:00 PM on March 26th and we would really appreciate it if we could get some volunteers to sign up for lab management. The shifts are 2 hours each and you will be provided with free food and a t-shirt! You really don't have to do anything other than check people in and out on a spreadsheet and make sure everyone is behaving, so you can get work done, watch Netflix, or anything else really while on your shift! If you are interested, please put your name in a shift (or 2) in the following Google Sheets! Thanks!
