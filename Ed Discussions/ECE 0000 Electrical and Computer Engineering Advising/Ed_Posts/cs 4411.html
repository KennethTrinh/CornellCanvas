  Hello, I was wondering if CS 4411 counts as a 3000+ elective for ECE. To my understanding, the only requirement is that the ECE upper level electives have to sum to 21 credits.

  Yeah, as long as you have at least 21 credits total across CDE, 4000+, and 3000+, you can count a 2-credit course such as CS 4411 toward one of those categories.
