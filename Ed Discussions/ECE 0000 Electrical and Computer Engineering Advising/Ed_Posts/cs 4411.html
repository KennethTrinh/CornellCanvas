 Hello, I was wondering if CS 4411 counts as a 3000+ elective for ECE. To my understanding, the only requirement is that the ECE upper level electives have to sum to 21 credits.
</p>
<p>
 Thank you so much!

  Yeah, as long as you have at least 21 credits total across CDE, 4000+, and 3000+, you can count a 2-credit course such as CS 4411 toward one of those categories.
