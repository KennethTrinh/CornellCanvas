  If I took a course at a different university in place of 3140 (and transferred the credit), can I still count 4750 as a CDE? I am wondering because on the course roster for 4750 it says that I must have taken 3140 for it to count as a CDE. So if I took an "equivalent" course can it still count?

  I should also add that the transfer credit is listed as ECE 3140 on my transcript. Thanks!

  Prof. Delchamps and I conferred and concluded that the language in question is obsolete and should have been removed a long time ago. We will remove it, although it might take a while for the change to propagate through  the various databases. You can ignore it in the meantime. I apologize for the confusion.

  Yes. If you received transfer credit for ECE 3140 then it's like you took ECE 3140 for all intents and purposes.

  Please tell me exactly where it says that about 4750 not counting as a CDE without 3140.  It sounds like an old piece of text that might need correcting.

  [EDIT: This could be a throwback to the days when ECE took a strict (even draconian) view of prerequisites. Prof. Delchamps knows the history better than me.]

  ECE students must take ECE 3140/CS 3420 to count ECE 4750 as a culminating design experience (CDE) course.
