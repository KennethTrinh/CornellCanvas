 If I took a course at a different university in place of 3140 (and transferred the credit), can I still count 4750 as a CDE? I am wondering because on the course roster for 4750 it says that I must have taken 3140 for it to count as a CDE. So if I took an "equivalent" course can it still count?

  I should also add that the transfer credit is listed as ECE 3140 on my transcript. Thanks!

  Prof. Delchamps and I conferred and concluded that the language in question is obsolete and should have been removed a long time ago. We will remove it, although it might take a while for the change to propagate through  the various databases. You can ignore it in the meantime. I apologize for the confusion.

   Please tell me exactly where it says that about 4750 not counting as a CDE without 3140.  It sounds like an old piece of text that might need correcting.

    It says it on the course description for the class on scheduler for this semester:

    ECE students must take ECE 3140/CS 3420 to count ECE 4750 as a culminating design experience (CDE) course.

     , and thus appears automatically in the roster.

     [EDIT: This could be a throwback to the days when ECE took a strict (even draconian) view of prerequisites. Prof. Delchamps knows the history better than me.]

    Yes. If you received transfer credit for ECE 3140 then it's like you took ECE 3140 for all intents and purposes.
