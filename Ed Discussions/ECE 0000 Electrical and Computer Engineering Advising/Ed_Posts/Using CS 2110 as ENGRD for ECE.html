 Can I count CS 2110 as my ENGRD for ECE major if I'm also using it as a core requirement for my CS major?
</p>
<p>
 Conversely, can I count ECE 2300 as my ENGRD for CS major if I'm also using it as a core requirement for my ECE major?
</p>

  You can double count basically anything across the two majors, you just can't double count one course within a single major
