  On the ECE program requirements page it says that ECE 5830 (tech management) can be counted as an OTE for ECE undergrads. Just to confirm this doesn't count as the one allowed ECE course that can count as a OTE?

  Actually it does, at least according to the interpretation of the rules that the Curriculum Committee settled on when the same thing came up about four years ago.

  Can I ask what's the reasoning behind this? The website literally says "ECE majors may, however, count ECE 5830 --- Introduction to Technical Management --- as an Outside-ECE Technical Elective" under the section talking about business courses that count as OTE. I understand the course is taught by ECE faculty but the content doesn't really focus on ECE subjects.

  I already used my one allowed ECE OTE. Is there any way to petition this course to count as a OTE?

  I suggest petitioning it.  I don't remember the details of the discussion, but I do remember personally not being on board with some of the rationale.  Similar "reasoning" arose when ECE 2400 appeared and hadn't yet been approved as an ENGRD.  The committee decided that students could count it as OTE but that in doing so they would "eat up" their one allowed ECE OTE.  I didn't care for that outcome, either.

  My attitude: ECE 5830 is like a business course.  ECE 2400 is like a coding course.  Those courses' orbits arguably share more with, say, Dyson and with Bowers CIS than they do with ECE.
