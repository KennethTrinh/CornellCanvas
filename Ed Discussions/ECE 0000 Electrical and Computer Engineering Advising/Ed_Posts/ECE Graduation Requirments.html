 Dear Professors,
</p>
<p>
 For the graduating seniors, are there other administrative papers we need to turn in besides our graduation checklist?
</p>
<p>
 I just want to confirm as I couldn't find much details about graduation requirements in the ECE website or the ECE-listserv emails.
</p>
<p>
 Thank you
</p>

  Hi,
 </p>
 <p>
  There are a couple steps to make sure students are set to graduate, but only one item to submit to ECE:
 </p>
 <p>
  1. Graduating students need to send their filled-in checklists to me at dam373 via
  <a href="https://dropbox.cornell.edu/login">
   Cornell's Secure File Transfer service
   . You can do this now to make sure you are on track to graduate at the end of spring.
  </a>
 </p>
 <list style="unordered">
  <li>
   <p>
    For students who took ECE 2200 [
    <link href="https://www.ece.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/departments/ECE/2021-checklist-2200.xlsx"/>
    XLSX]
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    For students who took ECE 2720 [
    <link href="https://www.ece.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/departments/ECE/2021-checklist-2720.xlsx"/>

   </p>
  </li>
 </list>
 <p>
  2. Check your listed expected graduation term, if you have questions about this or you need to re-term, please email me at dam373@cornell.edu.
 </p>
 <p>
  3. Diplomas are mailed directly to your Home address after degrees are awarded. Prior to your degree date, please review and update your home address in

   I'm not sure.  Check with Devan Musa and/or Scott Coldren to find out about these kinds of paperwork details.  Like, I don't know whether you need to declare officially somehow that you plan to graduate --- I certify that your Graduation Checklist works, but beyond that I'm in the dark.
