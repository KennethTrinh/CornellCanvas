  Dear Professors,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For the graduating seniors, are there other administrative papers we need to turn in besides our graduation checklist?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I just want to confirm as I couldn't find much details about graduation requirements in the ECE website or the ECE-listserv emails.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thank you
 </paragraph>

  I'm not sure.  Check with Devan Musa and/or Scott Coldren to find out about these kinds of paperwork details.  Like, I don't know whether you need to declare officially somehow that you plan to graduate --- I certify that your Graduation Checklist works, but beyond that I'm in the dark.

  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  There are a couple steps to make sure students are set to graduate, but only one item to submit to ECE:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1. Graduating students need to send their filled-in checklists to me at dam373 via
  <link href="https://dropbox.cornell.edu/login"/>
  Cornell's Secure File Transfer service. You can do this now to make sure you are on track to graduate at the end of spring.
