  The course's home department is ECE, so it doesn't count automatically for OTE.  You're allowed to use one course with ECE as home department toward OTE if we can interpret it as outside your "major disciplinary area" in ECE.  If not ECE 4960, then maybe some other upper-level ECE course you've taken or plan to take?

   Do I have to petition or will it be obvious if most of my courses are circuit design related?

    If that's the case, it'll be obvious.  To be safe, send me your Graduation Checklist.
