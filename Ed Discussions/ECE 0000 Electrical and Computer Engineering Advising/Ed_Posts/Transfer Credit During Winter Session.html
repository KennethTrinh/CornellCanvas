 I would like to take a course at a different school to fulfill a liberal study requirement. The Engineering Advising website states that I could only do this "

  during summer session, or while a student is on a leave of absence.
 </a>
 " Does this include winter break?

  I think Winter Break is fine for that, but Engineering Advising would know for sure.
