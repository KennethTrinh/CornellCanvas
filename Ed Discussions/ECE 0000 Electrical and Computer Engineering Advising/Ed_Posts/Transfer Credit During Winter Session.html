  I would like to take a course at a different school to fulfill a liberal study requirement. The Engineering Advising website states that I could only do this "
  <link href="https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/engr.registrar/ap-and-transfer-credit"/>
  during summer session, or while a student is on a leave of absence." Does this include winter break?

  I think Winter Break is fine for that, but Engineering Advising would know for sure.
