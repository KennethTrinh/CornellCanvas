  Hi! I'm a CS major who wants to complete an ECE minor. I've started taking some minor requirements, but I was wondering if I somehow needed to "declare" the minor, which I know that some other minors at the university require.

  Thanks!

  You do not delcare an ECE minor, it is just certified upon completion.

  (I noticed the minor form still lists ECE 2200 only for 2000s level requirements, assuming it just has not been updated to reflect 2720 as an option?)

  Hi Everyone,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  To view the ECE Minor Application, please click
  <link href="https://www.ece.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/departments/ECE/ECE-Minor-Form-20220207.pdf"/>
  here.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If you have completed the requirements, you can send the completed form to me at dam373@cornell.edu
  <link href="https://sft.cornell.edu/login/?redirurl=%2F"/>
  here.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If you are in your last undergraduate semester, you can submit the form without having completed all the courses for processing and then it will be reviewed for approval once grades are submitted.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Completed Minors will be posted by graduation or the end of the semester of completion if not before.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Please let me know if there are any additional questions.
