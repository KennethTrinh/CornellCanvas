  Yeah, because it has a BIOLS designation.

  For awareness, PLBIO 2400 is also approved for use as a liberal study.

  Yup, the boundaries get murkier by the year.  Back in the day, CS 2850 Networks was the only course I knew of that worked as either OTE or LS.  I see lots more borderline cases arising, particularly INFO courses.  This fall, ECE will re-assess how it handles the OTE requirement and how ECE's rules compare with those of other majors.  Lots of variety!

  Can you double count a course like PLBIO 2400 as both an OTE and a liberal studies class?

  No --- OTE XOR LS.
