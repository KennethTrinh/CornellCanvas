 For Program Requirements for ECE under academic standards, it states: A student must achieve a grade of C- or better in any course counted toward ECE major requirements, including ECE Core and Foundation courses; Upper-level ECE Electives; and Outside-ECE Technical Electives offering a letter-grade option. Does this include classes taken for the advanced programming requirement?

  What graduation requirement does the course fulfill?  Remember that the advanced-programming requirement is just a check-off --- you just make sure one course you took toward your gradaution requirements covers advanced programming.

   The course is ECE 2400. It doesn't fit into the listed categories, does that mean it is technically not an ECE Major Requirement? I suppose however if it is used as an Engineering distribution would it then be considered as being used for an ECE major requirement?

    If you use it as ENGRD or Advisor-approved Elective, you just need to pass it (i.e. not an F) to have it count and to cover the advanced-programming requirement.
