  On the ECE requirement website, it says that "a course cross-listed with an ECE course number is acceptable, even if a student registers for it with a non-ECE course number."
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Does that mean if I take a course like CS 4750 (ECE 4770), I can double count it toward both ECE and CS major electives (I plan to double major in ECE and CS)?

  Correct!  ECE doesn't care whether you (also) use courses toward CS major or minor requirements.  CS doesn't care whether you (also) use courses toward ECE major or minor requirements.

 <paragraph>
  Furthermore, ECE doesn't care how you sign up for CS/ECE cross-listed courses, whereas CS does, so if there's any chance you'll use a cross-listed course toward CS major or minor, register for the CS course number.
