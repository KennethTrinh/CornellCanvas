 I feel like I've seen this somewhere but can't find a clear answer on Ed, the handbook, or on the ECE requirements web page.

  Most definitely. If any class would, ECE 3100 would. The reason it is slowly disappearing from the handbook, etc. is that ECE 2720 also satisfies the requirement, and ECE 2720 is now required of all students.
 </p>
 <p>
  EDIT: "required of all students" meaning that everyone has to take either ECE 2200 or ECE 2720 and ECE 2200 is no longer being offered. So the prob/stats requirement is becoming less salient with each passing semester.
