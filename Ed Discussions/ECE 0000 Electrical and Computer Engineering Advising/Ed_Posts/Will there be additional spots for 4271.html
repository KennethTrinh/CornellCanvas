  I don't think it's full.  We can raise the cap if necessary, though.

  I just checked this evening and it was either full or had one spot, depending on which database I looked at. We are in the process of raising the cap. Should be done tomorrow.

  I'm not sure the point of this question? The course can rapidly switch between being open and closed when it is near-full, as students add and drop.
