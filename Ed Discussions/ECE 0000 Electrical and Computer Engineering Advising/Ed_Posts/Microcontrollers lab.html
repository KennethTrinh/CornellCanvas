  Would it be possible to open a night section for microcontrollers lab? It seems to conflict with all the classes I want to take.

  That would be challenging. ECE 2300 and 4760 use the same lab space, so Monday and Wednesday are out. We're supposed to avoid Tue/Thu evening classes as much as possible due to prelim conflicts. And there are no classes on Friday evenings.
