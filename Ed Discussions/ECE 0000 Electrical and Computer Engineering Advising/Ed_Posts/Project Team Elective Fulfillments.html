 Can we have credit from project teams count towards both an advisor-approved elective as well as an outside technical elective? With that, is there a limit to the number of semesters of project team credit that can be applied towards these elective requirements?

  You can count up to 3 credits of project-team toward OTE.  You can count as many credits as you want toward Advisor-approved Elective.  You just can't count the same credit hours twice.  Typically you'll count one semester toward OTE and two others toward AAE.
