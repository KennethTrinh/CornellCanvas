 Right now this class is MW from 2:45pm - 4:00pm. I really want to take this class but the Wednesday lecture conflicts with Wines which I 'have' to take before I graduate. How set in stone is the lecture time?

  Moving a class is asking for trouble at this point because pre-enroll starts tomorrow morning. We do have one class that we are moving, but only because it was a late addition and we are worried it won't get a classroom otherwise.

  The larger issue is that, unfortunately, we can't move classes around based considerations like the above. Anyplace we put ECE 5210, it will conflict with something. I promise you if we move it, someone will complain that they were planning to take it MW 2:45-4:00 but now they can't. We can only aim to spread our classes out as much as possible and try to avoid conflicts between similar ECE classes that are likely to attract the same body of students. We also try to spread out classes needed for graduation so that no one's graduation is delayed because they can't enroll in all of the classes they need.
