 If I can't double count finance for something, then I won't be able to complete my business minor. Is there a reason why finance, a math and analysis based class, is not considered technical?

  You can petition it.  If you find a comparable course in engineering (e.g. ORIE 3150 or CEE 3230 or something along those lines) that you can point to, it would help your case.
