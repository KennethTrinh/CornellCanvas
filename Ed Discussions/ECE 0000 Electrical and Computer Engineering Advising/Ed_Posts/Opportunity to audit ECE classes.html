  There are so many cool classes in ECE, but many classes are already full. I am wondering if it is possible for students to audit some of the classes next semester?

  Undergraduate students cannot Audit courses, sorry. That grading option is only available for graduate students.

  Cornell undergraduates can't audit Cornell courses.  Grad students can audit courses that offer an audit option --- the instructor decides whether to offer such an option.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  That said, any course's instructor might be open to letting any students not enrolled in the course attend class, ask questions, erc.  Again, totally instructor's call.

  Which classes are you interested in that are full? I went through the roster on classes.cornell.edu and did not find many full courses. The few that I saw were either graduate or crosslistings.

  I was hoping to take/audit ECE 5670 (Digital Communication). I am really interested in the topic but I am not sure if it will fit into my schedule this semester. I guess I won't be able to audit the class either since it's only going to be my first semester as an early MEng. student, so technically I'm still an undergraduate student. But thank you so much for taking the time to look up everything! Really appreciate it!

  You are unable to enroll in this class at this time. Available seats are reserved. You do not meet the enrollment group criteria to enroll in this class at this time."

  That's a known limitation with student center: early-admit M.Eng. students can't enroll in certain M.Eng. classes via student center because they aren't technically M.Eng. students. Talk to Devan Musa and she can get you in (assuming there are spots). You could also enroll in 4670 for now and we can "upgrade" you to 5670 later.
