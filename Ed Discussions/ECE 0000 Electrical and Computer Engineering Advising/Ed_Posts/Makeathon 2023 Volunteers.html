 Hey everyone! We are also looking for general volunteers for Makeathon to just walk around and ask people how they are doing on their projects! Again, its pretty laid back and you will get free food and tshirts! Also, we still need some more sign ups for the lab shifts, so if you have any time and desire to get free stuff then please sign up! Thanks!
