<p>
 Can I petition a minor requirement? I want to petition a 4000 or 5000-level class down to a foundations class. If so, which form should I use? Should I have my advisor in my home major sign as the advisor, or have someone else sign?
</p>
<p>
 Thanks!

  Your official advisor can sign off on it.  If you have trouble getting your official advisor's signature, I can sign off on it.
