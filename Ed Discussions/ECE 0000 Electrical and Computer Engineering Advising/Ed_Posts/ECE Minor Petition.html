  Can I petition a minor requirement? I want to petition a 4000 or 5000-level class down to a foundations class. If so, which form should I use? Should I have my advisor in my home major sign as the advisor, or have someone else sign?

  Thanks!

  Your official advisor can sign off on it.  If you have trouble getting your official advisor's signature, I can sign off on it.
