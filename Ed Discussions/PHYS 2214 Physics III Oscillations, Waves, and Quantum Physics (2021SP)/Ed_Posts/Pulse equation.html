  I understand that we can only use the pulse equation for a single pulse travelling in one direction. But does it have to be a traveling wave (like on a string), or can it also be applied to standing waves (like sound waves)?

  A standing wave is equivalent to two overlapping traveling waves moving in opposite directions.  (See section 7.B starting with Eq. (7-1) in the Course Notes.)  So the pulse equation does not apply to standing waves.

  Sound waves can be either traveling waves or standing waves.  An analogue of the pulse equation does hold for traveling sound waves.
