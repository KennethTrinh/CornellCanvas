  Regarding the wording of lab 5 1.1, are we supposed to just draw the image we saw on the wall?

  I see your problem: how to make a photo when the gadget you use for photos is itself making the image! We are not expecting a Rembrandt or Picasso, just a clear schematic drawing. For example, circles with arrows indicating "bright", some tick marks with distances in cm or mm, etc.
