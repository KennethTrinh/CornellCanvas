  For question 4d, I am trying to use the given densities for air and water to solve for pressure so I can solve for v and Z. My thought was to use the ideal gas equation where P=nRT. However, I am not sure what values to use for temperature  along with R the gas constant. Can I use the universal R or are there specific values for water and air?  And what temperature should I use? (if this is the correct approach at all)

  I think my mistake might be that im confusing pressure and density and now im getting the correct wave speeds
