  Will there be any final reviews planned? During a discussion section or extra-scheduled time?

  We aren't planning to hold review sessions, as such.  However, we will have expanded office hours Tuesday through Thursday next week, leading up to the final.   (The exact schedule will be posted on Canvas as soon as we have figured it out.)  If there are concepts which are unclear to you, please bring pose example problems to the teaching staff during office hours, and we will help you work through them.
