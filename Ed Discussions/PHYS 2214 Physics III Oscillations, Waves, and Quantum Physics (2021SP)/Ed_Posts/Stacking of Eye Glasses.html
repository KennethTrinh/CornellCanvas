 If I were to stack eye glasses on top of each other, say they were all convex or all concave lenses, then would the total eyeglass refraction equal to all the refractions added up? So if I had a a prescription of 3 diopters, and I put a 1 diopter lens against a two diopter lens would I be able to see?
</p>
<p>
 Similarly, if I put a 1 diopter lens against a -1 diopter lens, would the light travel as if never refracted? Would this change the polarization?
</p>
<p>
 thank you in advance !

  Yes, lens powers (in diopters) of stacked lenses are additive.  I don't believe lenses have noticeable impact upon polarization.
