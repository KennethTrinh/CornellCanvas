 This might be obvious, but which wavelength would be using in this equation?  Aren't we finding the delta theta between two waves?

  There is only one wavelength involved.  The idea is similar to that of a single slit illuminated with light of a single frequency.  The pattern on the screen beyond the slit (circular hole in this case) contains locations of zero intensity and locations of high intensity.  If the two sources viewed by a telescope are stars, we are assuming the stars have the same kind of light; the delta-theta is the angular separation of the stars in the sky, and if the angle is too small, our telescope won't be able to resolve the image into two dots--it will remain one dot.
