  I am a bit confused by the numerical answer of "0" for 2b. As I understand, light polarized at 0 deg goes through a 1/4 wave plate and should become circularly polarized. The now circularly polarized light goes through a 90 deg linear polarizer, so we should see the y component (90 degrees) of the circularly polarized light, not 0... right?

  I believe linearly polarized light at 0 degrees remains linearly polarized after it goes through the 1/4 wave plate. This means when it goes through the 90 degree polarizer, the transient intensity is 0 according to Malus's Law (with the angle 90 degrees as that is the difference between the incident E field and the polarizer axis).

  A quarter-wave plate turns linearly polarized incident light into circularly/elliptically polarized light only if the incident light has components along both axes of the plate (one component ends up lagging a quarter cycle behind the other). In 2b, the polarization of incident light is entirely along one axis of the plate and remains linear after passing through the quarter-wave plate.
