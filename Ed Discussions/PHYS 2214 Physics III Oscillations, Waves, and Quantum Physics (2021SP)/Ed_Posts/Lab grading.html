 Is the grading of labs based on correctness or completion? Or as long as we worked during lab session but didn't finish all and submit it on Canvas we can earn full credits?

  Grading is on correctness and completion.  Full credit is awarded if the submitted file is complete and correct.  "Complete" for M1 Complex Analysis is questions 1 through 6.  "Complete" for L1 Oscillations is to the bottom of page 11 (no video data was provided for parts B8 and B9, so answers to those parts are not needed).
