  I was looking at the solutions for HW1 and noticed that all the examples in 3d were either critically damped or underdamped, so I was just curious what kinds of situations might require overdamping?

  Two examples that I have seen discussed are (1) Handicap-access door closer mechanisms, where you want the door to close very slowly, (2) Push-button water faucet shut-off valves (like you see in public restrooms) where you want the water to turn off after a reasonably-long time.
