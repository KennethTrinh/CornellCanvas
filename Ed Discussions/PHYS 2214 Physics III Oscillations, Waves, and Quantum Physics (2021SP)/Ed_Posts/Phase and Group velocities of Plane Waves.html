 From my current understanding, when I think of group velocity, I think of the velocity of a general group of waves (like the velocity of the envelope of a beat), while when I think of phase velocity, I think of the velocity of singular waves (like the velocity of a wave that makes up a beat, or the velocity of the faster, enveloped wave of a beat). So I was having a hard time visualizing how a plane wave:

 has different phase and group velocities since it just looks like a perfect sinusoid that doesn't really have a "group" like a beat.
</p>
<p>
 Can someone maybe help clarify my understanding of phase and group velocities?

  A simple plane wave with one well defined wavelength will move at the phase velocity.  The group velocity is really only relevant to analyze the superposition of two or more plane waves.  If you know the dispersion curve $\omega(k)$ for a particular type of plane waves you can calculate the group velocity as $d\omega/dk$, but physically the group velocity only matters once you have a superposition.

  From your question, it sounds like you already have a good understanding of phase and group velocities.

   Thank you! I also had a follow-up question. When we do have a superposition of two or more waves, how do we know which k from which wave to use for calculating the phase and group velocities?
