 It seems a bit unfair that the lab M2 is due today especially since its due the day before the prelim and provides those with wednesday lab sections a lot less time to work  (given that it is very long) while others had until wednesday to work on it if needed.

  If you have not already turned in the lab, please do so.

   And yet, the content of this lab is covered on tomorrow's prelim.  The thought was to encourage all students to complete the lab as part of their study for the exam.  The usual lab due date is Friday, and the 2:40-4:35 Friday lab students face the quick due date regularly.  If you submit your lab a day late, full credit will still be awarded.

    Does this still apply? I am so embarrassed, but... because of the way my assignments are laid out each week, I block out time on Thursday night to do my physics labs (to turn them in by Friday at 5pm). I put all of these assignments on my calendar at the beginning of the semester not realizing there would be an exception this weekü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

    I was fully aware that the content of the lab was required knowledge for the exam, but I didn't realize until just now that I was supposed to turn in the lab by Wednesday at 11:59pm. I know it's only 1% of the grade, but... I'd love to still turn it in by Friday at 5pm to get that 1% if I can... üòñ Will it be allowed?

    Thank you either way :)
