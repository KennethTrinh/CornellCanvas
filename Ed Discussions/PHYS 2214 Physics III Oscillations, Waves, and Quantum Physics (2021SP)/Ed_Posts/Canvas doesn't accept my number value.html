  I've only encountered this issue on Coops but whenever I put in a value that's been verified by my TA, the canvas quiz will still mark it as wrong. This most recent instance is for Coop 10, where the 3rd question keeps negating my answer. My answer could still just be wrong, so if the answer truly isn't ~.422 then what am I doing wrong? I don't think the hint you get after getting the question wrong leaves much room for error

  I had this problem too for a while. I forgot that the tanh function in the denominator is under a square root sign and kept getting that answer. Maybe you have the same problem?
