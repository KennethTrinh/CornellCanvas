 There is a typo in q.3, q.4, and q.5 of the quiz that says "The pulse is reflected by by interaction" I'm not sure how to interpret this.

  Thank you for pointing out the typos.  (In each case, there should be just one "by".)  I will correct for next semester.  The questions are referring to aspects of wave reflection caused by fixed or free boundaries, as discussed in today's reading.
