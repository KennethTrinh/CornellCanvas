 For the last part of Lab M2, I cannot find the suggested app for spectrum analysis anywhere on the internet nor App Store. I have been trying to find a replacement app that does the same thing but so far I haven't found one that allows me to set the sample rate below 1kHz. Any suggestions?

  Here's one that's easy and intuitive, though it doesn't seem very precise.  It's for a computer's browser.
