 I'm still confused by this explanation for question 4 on quiz 1:

 How do we know the frictional force is equal and opposite to Fd? I think in general I still get confused about the relationship between the damping and the drive

  This is not a fact that I necessarily carry around in my head all the time, but it does follow quickly from our equations of motion.  For an oscillatory drive force $F_D e^{i\omega t}$ (real part understood), the equation of motion is $m(d^2 y/dt^2 ) +b(dy/dt) +ky = F_D e^{i\omega t}$.  Assuming an oscillatory solution $y(t) = y_0 e^{i\omega t}$ and using that at resonance $\omega^2 = k/m$ so the first and third terms in the equation of motion cancel at this frequency, one has $y_0 = F_D/(i \omega b)$ so that $y(t) = [F_D/(i \omega b)]e^{i\omega t}$.  Taking the derivative to calculate the velocity, then $v(t) = (F_D/ b) e^{i\omega t}$, so that the frictional force $= -bv(t) = -F_D e^{i\omega t}$.
