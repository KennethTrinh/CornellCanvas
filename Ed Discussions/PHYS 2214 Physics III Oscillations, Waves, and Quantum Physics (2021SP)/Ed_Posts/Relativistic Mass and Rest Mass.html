  The equation that Homework 10 provides us with is Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity:
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  E^2=m_o^{\ \ 2}c^4+p^2c^2=\left(mc^2\right)^2
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  where m
  <sub>
   o
  </sub>
  is rest mass and m is total relativistic mass.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I have two questions that I am curious about, if that is okay:
 </paragraph>
 <list style="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    What exactly is total relativistic mass? We are told that it is equal to momentum divided by speed of light, but what does that quantity represent?
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    How was the frame of reference determined to obtain m
    <sub>
     o
    </sub>
    the rest mass when there isn't a true "concept" of rest in the universe? For example, if a person were to sit down, this person may believe he is at rest, but he is moving through space at the speed of which Earth travels through space.

  First, for the frame of reference question:  the sitting person is a rest in that person's own frame of reference.  Anything is always at rest in its own frame of reference because if you think of it carrying around its own coordinate system, it is always at the same position relative to its own coordinate axes.  So "rest mass" is the mass something has in its own reference frame.  "Total relativistic mass" is the mass a moving object has--that mass must refer to what is measured from a reference frame other than the frame the 'moving' object would call its own.  So an electron's mass in its own frame is m_o "rest mass".  A second electron moving through the first's frame (of course the first isn't moving at all in its own frame) will have a "total relativistic mass" that is larger than the value of m_o.

  "momentum divided by speed of light" is not the total relativistic mass, m.

  Just to add to Prof. Case's answer -- $m = p/c$ for the total relativistic mass does hold for photons of light as stated in the homework (this is related to our classical expression $p=E/c$).  However for particles with mass the more general expression is $m = p/v$.
