 I'm confused why the probability in region 3 wouldn't be oscillating. Shouldn't it look similar to the probability function in region 1, but with a smaller amplitude? And if it truly isn't oscillating, then what is "k1" in the wave function Psi3, if it isn't the same wavenumber as in Psi1?

 Thank you!

  The difference between regions 1 and 3 is that region 3 just has a transmitted wave moving in the +x direction (including the time dependence, the full wavefunction in region 3 is $\psi_3(x,t)= F  e^{i(k_1 x - \omega t)}$), while region 1 has both an incident wave moving in the +x direction ($A  e^{i(k_1 x - \omega t)}$) plus a reflected wave moving in the -x direction ($B  e^{i(-k_1 x - \omega t)}$).  If you take the wavefunction in region 3 and multiply it by its complex conjugate, you get a result that does not depend on either position (within region 3) or time.  However, when you take the full wavefunction in region 1 and multiply by its complex conjugate, the result is not independent of position.  The full algebra for region 1 is worked out explicitly on slide 13 of Lecture 25.
