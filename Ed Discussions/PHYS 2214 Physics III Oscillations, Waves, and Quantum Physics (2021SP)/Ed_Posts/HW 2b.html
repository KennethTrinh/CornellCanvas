  Can we use the equations that involve frequency for stationary states to solve for the angular frequency in 2b although it involves non-stationary states?

  I'm not sure precisely what you are asking, but I can help you get started here.  To calculate the probability distribution function at $x=L/4$, what you want to do is multiply $\Psi(x,t)$ by the complex conjugate of $\Psi(x,t)$ and evaluate at $x=L/4$.  After some algebra, this will give you a real-valued oscillatory function of time for the probability density at this position.

  Yeah, I already got that for 2a already but I guess my question is can we use E= (h/2pi)(omega) since that is an equation listed under stationary states slide in lecture notes?
