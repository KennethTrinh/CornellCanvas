  It seems like the videos posted for the pre-lecture exercise do not match up with the material on the quiz? Can this be corrected?

  I think the instructors are aware of this because of this announcement they made a while back:

  This makes me think that they aren't going to change it, though I could be overruled by course staff if I am incorrect.

  I think what the poster was saying was that the lecture videos have pretty much nothing to do with the reading quiz. This is because the lecture videos posted are for unit 25, not unit 26 (may be an accident), which we are skipping over briefly to cover unit 26 first. So for anyone reading this, make sure to do the textbook reading rather than watch the pre-lecture video for Thursday lecture.

  I did mess up the traditional lectures that I had posted for the Thursday lecture this week (because of the swap between units 25 and 26).  Thank you for pointing this out.  I will fix it now.
