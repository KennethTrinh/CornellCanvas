  In question 7, it says that the kinetic energy density would be maximum at the point of 0 y-displacement and Im not really sure why. If the y displacement is 0 then doesnt that mean delta y = 0. and so (delta y/delta t) = 0. Is it because at delta y = 0, it would be a point of inflection and so dy/dt is maximum there?

  If you have an object moving past the position $y = 0$ at some nonzero velocity, you have $dy/dt \neq 0$ even though $y = 0$.  So having zero displacement at some particular instance of time does not mean that the displacement is zero at all times or that there is zero velocity.

  but doesn't the question say at the point of 0 displacement?

  From your original question, "If the y displacement is 0 then doesnt that mean delta y = 0."  Answer: emphatically "no!"  The condition y=0 does not imply delta-y=0.
