 Does the questions expect the answer to be an interval of x values for each case? If so can we just give the intervals for one wavelength of both waves interfering?

  The answer will be a series of positions, not a range of positions.  The 'near what x values' is intended to suggest you can provide approximate, rather than exact locations.
