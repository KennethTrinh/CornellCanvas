 I got that the kinetic energy density for the transmitted wave is 9/4 and the kinetic energy density for the reflected way is 1. My initial thought process was to just add the values, but thinking about it more I realized that constructive interference minimizes kinetic energy at points of overlap, so I subtracted the values, but the answer was still wrong. Any tips or ideas on what to do.

   So the hint essentially says that we want to find the total transverse velocity, and to do so, we must find the transverse velocities of the incident pulse and the reflected pulse individually, and sum those velocities up to get the total transverse velocity. These individual velocities will be in terms of the propagation velocity "v" of the x &lt; 0 portion of the string (the same "v" in the pulse equation) because we are not given what "v" is.
  </p>
  <p>
   I would recommend you drawing a graph of the incident pulse and the reflected pulse to help you out with this part just to visualize what is going on. Try to imagine the direction that the string is moving due to each of the pulses so the signs of transverse velocity are correct.
  </p>
  <p>
   Once you get the total transverse velocity, you are able to use the formula for kinetic energy density (hint: even though you are not given mu, you can rewrite mu in terms of "v" and another known value and things should cancel).
  </p>

   Hope this helps!
