 If a linearly polarized wave is passed through a linear polarizer whose polarization axis is pi + theta, where theta is the incident wave's polarization angle, the polarizer would not allow anything through. Is this correct?

  The wave is blocked if the transmission axis of the polarizer is rotated by $\pm \pi/2$ relative to the polarization angle of the wave, not by $\pi$.  There is no change upon rotating the transmission axis by $\pi$.
