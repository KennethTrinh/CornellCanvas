  The question says underdamped, not strongly underdamped, so it's better to assume that b^2&lt;4mk than to assume b^2&lt;&lt;4mk.

  I agree, the &lt;&lt; must be a typo (it should just be &lt; ).

  Yes, there is an extra &lt; in the question statement that will lead you astray.

  Doing so won't help you get to the desired result. The easiest thing I found to do was to start with the differential equation for the damped oscillator, rewrite the coefficients in terms of the time constant and frequency rather than parameters such as b,m, or k, and then replace the derivative and second derivative terms with the actual derivatives that I computed from the form of the assumed solution.

  Complex numbers can be your friend!  I recommend starting from Equation (1-26) in the Course notes for the value of alpha, determining what is the imaginary part of alpha in the underdamped case b^2 &lt; 4mk, and then seeing if you can express the result in terms of \omega_0 and \tau_A.
