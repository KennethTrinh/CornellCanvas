 I know it is a little weird if we already worked out the answer during discussion but I was thinking the coop solution will help to check whether our method and thought process is correct and mainly for review.

  It is excellent for you to check whether your method and thought process is correct -- but please do this by discussing the problems with your TA during your discussion section or with any of the teaching staff of the course during office hours.  We re-use the coop questions from semester to semester, and to best optimize the amount of learning from them we prefer to minimize the potential circulation of solutions between semesters.
