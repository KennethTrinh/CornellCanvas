 I'm struggling with this question. I think that the total energy of string will be twice the energy of each pulse but I'm confused as to how to find the energy of each pulse. I'm looking at equation   5-10 in the course notes but I'm not sure how to determine the partials of y with respect to t and x.

  With triangular shapes, there is no defined slope or derivative at the peak.  We ignore this discontinuity point, but can still get slopes and energies from all other points on the string.  The key here is that the slopes of the overlapping pulses are identical, so the overlapping slope doubles.  The string velocities, however, are opposite (different algebraic signs in the pulse equations for different propagation directions); the overlapping velocities sum to zero.  Remember to square the derivatives after superposition (adding them together); it is incorrect to square the pulse 1 and pulse 2 derivatives prior to adding them.

   The partial with respect to x is simply the slope.  The partial with respect to t can be found by using the "pulse equation":  dy/dt = v (dy/dx) or dy/dt = -v (dy/dx).

    I guess now that I think about it I'm also confused as to where I'm taking the partial, because if it is done at the peak of the wave as suggested in the notes then dy/dx = 0 and then the dy/dt s for the two waves would be also be zero using the 'pulse equation'? Then the energy of the pulse would be zero and that doesn't make physical sense. I'm clearly missing something here but I'm not sure what.

    On my, albeit poor, physics intuition the dy/dt s for the two pulses should be equal in magnitude and opposite in sign so then when it they are squared the two energy densities are equal.
