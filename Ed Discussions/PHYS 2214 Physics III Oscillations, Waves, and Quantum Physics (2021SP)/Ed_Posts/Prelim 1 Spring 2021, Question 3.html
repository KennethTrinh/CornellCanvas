  I am unsure of how we can conclude that (a) is the correct answer for the first part of the question and that (b) is the correct answer of the second part of the question.

  In particular, I don't understand why Oscillator 1 has a larger quality factor when both oscillators end up having the same amplitudes, and I don't understand why Oscillator 2 has the larger drive amplitude when it's amplitude maxes out at a slower rate than Oscillator 1's amplitude.

  For part (a): The time scale over which oscillator 1 reaches its full oscillation amplitude is longer than for oscillator 2.  This time scale is $\tau_A = 2Q_0/\omega_0$.  Since the resonant frequency $\omega_0$ is the same for both oscillators, this means that the quality factor is larger for oscillator 1.  (Higher Q means lower damping and for an underdamped oscillator lower damping means that the time to reach equilibrium is longer.)

  For part (b).  For a given drive amplitude, the higher Q oscillator will have a larger oscillation amplitude when driven at the resonance frequency.  Since in this case the two oscillators have the same steady-state oscillation amplitude, that means that the drive amplitude for oscillator 2 (the one with lower Q) must be larger than for oscillator 1.
