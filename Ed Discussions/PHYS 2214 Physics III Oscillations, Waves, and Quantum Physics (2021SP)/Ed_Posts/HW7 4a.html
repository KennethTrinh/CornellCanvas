  In this problem when it says "let's ignore the diffraction effects due to the slit width"
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Does that mean treat it at first like an N source interference pattern with no missing principal maxima? (so we use N-source maxima equation instead of N-slit maxima equation)?

  In other words, in this part of the problem you are asked to imagine that the slit width is much narrower than the wavelength, which effectively means that each slit gives rise to an electromagnetic wave of equal amplitude for all forward angles. -- the simplest case with which we began our discussion of N-source interference.
