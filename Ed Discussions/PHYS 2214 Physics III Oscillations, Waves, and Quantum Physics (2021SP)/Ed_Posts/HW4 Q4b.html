  I've been working on this question for quite a while now and have been getting just about no where. Should I be trying to do something similar to what is done in the reading for section 8 on page 7? That is largely what I've been basing my process on so far but I think I must be missing some vital step or understanding to get an adequate answer

  You have correctly identified that Course Notes page 8-7 are relevant and useful as a model.  For strings, the force of each string at the junction has magnitude (tau)(dy/dx).  For the columns of fluids, the force of each fluid at the junction is (pressure)x(area) and pressure is related to displacement by  P = -B(ds/dx).  So the forces in both situations depends upon the 'slope.'  The vital step you may be missing is that strings must have the same tension (tau), but fluids will have different bulk moduli.  So while in Course Notes equation 8-26 all equal values of tau factor out of the relation, that won't be the case for bulk moduli in the case of fluids.

  but what about the step at equation 8-25?

  I'm unsure whether or not I should do something "parallel" to that to best answer part b

  The boundary condition that you are asked to determine in part b is the analog of Eq. 8-24.  The analog of Eq. 8-25 represents some of the algebra that you will want to do in part c to find the reflection and transmission coefficients.

  The idea leading to 8-25 is that the displacements of both strings at the boundary must be the same so that the string doesn't break (have a gap).  Similarly, the displacements of both fluids at the boundary must be the same so that there is no interval of vacuum (gap) or of two fluids simultaneously occupying the same volume.  So yes, 8-25 is still applicable to the fluid situation.
