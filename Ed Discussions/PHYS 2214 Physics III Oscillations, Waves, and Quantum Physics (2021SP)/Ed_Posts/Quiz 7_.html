 I am having trouble understanding why on Quiz 7 using the formula for principal maxima does not come to the same answer.  I used the fact that principal maxima are 2 times wider than the spacing between minima and minima are evenly spaced between maxima (I was taught this during a coop) to find that the next principal maxima must occur at theta=5pi/4. Given that maxima is the first maxima from the central one we know that n=1. The wavelength is 187.5m. Then we plug in those knowns into the equation [d * sin(theta) = n * wavelength]. That then comes out to have the d=265.16m.
</p>
<p>
 Then checking the answer of the quiz with that same formula of [d * sin(theta) = n * wavelength] we get that theta is not possible to find given the spacing found in the answer key.
</p>
<p>
 At what point did I go wrong in my understanding?

  The principal maxima are 2 times wider than the spacing between minima when plotted as a function of sin($\theta$), not when plotted as a function of $\theta$.  For small angles you can make the approximation that sin($\theta$) $\approx \theta$, but this is not true when you consider larger angles.  In this problem, there is no value of $\theta$ that will give you a $n=1$ principal maximum, because this would require a value of sin($\theta$) greater than one.

  You would get the correct answer using the formula for the 4th zero of the diffraction pattern for 5 sources:

  $d sin($90 degrees$) = 4 \lambda/5$, and solving for $d$, but it is generally easier (and less likely to lead to mistakes) if you analyze these types of problems in terms of phasors.
