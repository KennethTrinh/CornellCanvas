  Hi--
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I'm a rising senior and our pre-enrollment for classes next semester opens at 9 AM tomorrow. I also have lab section Mondays at 8 AM. It will likely only take a couple minutes to enroll, but as I'm sure most people are aware, it can be a pretty stressful process. Would it be okay if those of us with the slot tomorrow morning either log off lab for a couple minutes or just attend a different section, if we're able?

  I'm certain that attending lab and taking a few moments to schedule your classes in the middle will be fine
