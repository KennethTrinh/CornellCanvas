 Out of curiosity, how does light momentum work?
</p>
<p>
 I checked the units of light momentum
</p>
<math>
 p=\frac{h}{\lambda}=\left[\frac{\frac{kg\ m^2}{s}}{m}\right]=\left[kg\ \frac{m}{s}\right]
</math>
<p>
 and it dimensionally does equate to the classical momentum
</p>
<math>
 p=mv=\left[kg\ \frac{m}{s}\right]
</math>
<p>
 that we previously have learned. Are these two momentums (light momentum and classical momentum) fundamentally the same thing as the dimensional analysis suggests? If so, light doesn't have mass, so how does that work? Or is this a case of classical mechanics breaking down?
</p>

  Both the light momentum and the $mv$ momentum are momentum, and when thinking about conservation of total momentum you would need to consider the sum of both.  But you are correct that in the case of light you can't just write that the momentum is $mv$.  In the case of light, it is not necessary for there to be a mass in order to have a non-zero momentum.

  Light has momentum in classical physics, but in classical physics this momentum can take on a continuum of values.  What we find in experiments like the Compton effect is that this momentum can only take on the discrete value $h/\lambda$.  So in this sense, you are considering a breaking down of classical mechanics.
