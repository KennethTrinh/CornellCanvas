 In the problem statement, it says to check your sign of velocity to see if your phase is correct. I got the correct phase from plugging in values to the equation x(t) = Acos(wt + phi) and I got a positive velocity after taking the derivative of the x(t) = Acos(wt + phi) and plugging in the values. The solutions however do not talk about any sort of velocity. It talks about the peak occurring at a positive time meaning the phase has to be negative.
</p>
<p>
 So my question is what does positive time have to do with why the phase is negative and why does a positive velocity mean the phase is negative (assuming that I was supposed to get a positive velocity and did my math right)?

  There are different logical paths by which you can determine the sign of the phase in this problem.  Regarding the hint given in the statement of the problem, if the wave displacement has the form $x(t) = A cos(\omega t +\phi)$, then the velocity is $dx/dt = -A \omega sin(\omega t + \phi)$, and the velocity evaluated at time $t=0$ is $dx/dt = -A \omega sin(\phi)$.  To match the positive velocity at $t=0$ in the graph, you therefore need $sin(\phi)$ to have a negative value (assuming that $A$ is positive), or that $\phi$ is between 0 and $-\pi$.

  The logic of the answer given in the solution set is that the peak positive amplitude of the wave occurs from the graph at $t \approx +0.05$ ms.  The peak amplitude of the wave occurs when the argument of the cosine function, $\omega t +\phi$, is equal to zero.  Therefore if the time $t$ is positive for this condition, the phase $\phi$ must be negative.  Both logical approaches give a consistent answer.

   Oh, I see I was not thinking and forgot that the slope of the graph gave the velocity so at t=0 velocity has to be positive. Thank you
