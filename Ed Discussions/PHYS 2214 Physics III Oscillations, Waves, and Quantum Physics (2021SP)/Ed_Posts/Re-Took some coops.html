 I retook some coops today and now under grades it says that they are late, even though I completed them by the deadline.  Will this affect my grade?
</p>
<p>
 I did it since I wanted to see the results for 0 and see explanations for some.  The coops were 1, 14, 16.

  I'll make sure this doesn't hurt your grade.  Thanks for letting me know.
