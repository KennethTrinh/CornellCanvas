 I have tried to differentiate A(ω_D), and got a behemoth of an equation, that seems like a serious amount of work to find the roots of. Perhaps I just did it wrong, but I am now trying to find this "pro tip" professor Ralph referred to in another question. Due to the fact that the derivative requires product rule, I am struggling to see what this shortcut is.
</p>
<p>
 Any hints?

  Since you are only concerned with maximizing the amplitude of oscillations, you can neglect the phase part entirely; just differentiate $A(\omega_D)$, not $A(\omega_D)e^{i\phi}$

   How were you able to create nice in-line math -- as in $A(\omega_D)$ ? When I use the "Insert Math" editing tab I'm forced to display the math on a separate line.

    It follows Latex formatting; surround the expression with $ and type it in like '\omega_D' (without the quotes)

   I didn't need to use product rule at all, and I think I got the right answer since I checked with a TA during office hours. Maybe your A(ω_D) is wrong? Either way, I was able to write it in a way so that I could just chain rule the entire thing.

    This is helpful! I reworked it but I still have a gross product rule between the denominator of the original A(ω_D) and ϕ(ω_D). Is something supposed to cancel that I am missing or would imply that I have the wrong equation in part A?

     I'm not sure why you have ϕ(ω_D) since I don't think that's relevant to part b? For part b you're supposed to differentiate the A(ω_D) that you got in part a (the one that is real), which is supposed to look like equation 2-22 in the course notes (according to the answer on someone else's post). So if you didn't get that for A(ω_D), then I think you did something wrong in part a.

    Perhaps you could use the fact that numerator is a constant and only the denominator has a dependence on omega_D
   </p>

     That's the best approach. Look for the omega_D that minimizes the denominator. Better yet, minimize the argument of the square-root, since that's a monotonic function.
