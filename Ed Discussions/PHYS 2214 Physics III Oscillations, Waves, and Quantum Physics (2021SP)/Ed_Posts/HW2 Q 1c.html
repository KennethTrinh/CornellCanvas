  I took the derivative of 1/2b^2w^2A(wd)^2 to find dP/dt and I get this equation where I am not able to find an algebraic answer since I have wd^2 on one side and a wdwo on the other side and I can't factor anything. Any suggestions.

  It is difficult to advise without seeing more of the details of your attempt.  Perhaps a discussion during today's (W 2/24) office hours starting at 2:00 would be the best time and place to discuss this.
