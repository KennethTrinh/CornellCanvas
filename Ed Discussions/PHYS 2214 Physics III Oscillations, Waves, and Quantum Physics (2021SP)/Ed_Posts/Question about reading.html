  Can someone please explan why dy/dt = 0. I get it from the wave/pulse equation but am not able to see why dy/dt = 0 at A but its positive at B simply from looking at the image. I do get dy/dx is 0 though. All help is appreciated.

  Not sure if my understanding is correct/valid but, I kinda imagine it like throwing a ball into the air: at the very peak it's vertical speed will be zero (for that one instant). the same (I think) applies here. At the very peak the particles moving upwards would have been decelerating on the way getting there (not the whole way mind you) and have since reached zero vertical velocity.

  Hope that helps! (and I didn't mess anything up or confuse you more.....)

  Oliver's answer is correct.  I also think it can be helpful to draw a picture.  Draw out the original wave as a function of position at some time t=0, and then draw its position when it is shifted slightly at a slightly later time.  Motion of an individual element of the string must always be straight up and down since we are dealing with a transverse wave, so you can get an idea of how the velocity $dy/dt$ varies with position by drawing vertical arrows connecting the original and shifted waves.  From this sort of drawing you can see that when the slope $dy/dx$ of the waveform is close to zero then the velocity $dy/dt$ is also close to zero, because the original and shifted waveforms will nearly overlap at such positions.
