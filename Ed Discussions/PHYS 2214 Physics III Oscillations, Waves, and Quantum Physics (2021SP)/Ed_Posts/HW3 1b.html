  For part b are we just excepted to look up the value of the speed of sound in air and use that to calculate k and omega? Also can we assume phase is 0?

  The speed of sound in air is given in the Course Notes on page 4-8, about 343 m/s.  The phase relationship between the displacement and pressure is important, but not the initial phase.
