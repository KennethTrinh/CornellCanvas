 For #3 on quiz 7, why is the intensity 1/25? I thought that each vector would be equal to the Io so when there are 5 of them, the final would be also equal to the fill initial intensity.

  Since 3 of the phasors point in the positive direction along the real axis and 2 point in the negative direction, the total sum of the five phasors is just 1 $E_0$, compared to 5 $E_0$ at the principal maximum where all of the signals are in phase.  Since the intensity goes like the square of the total electric field, the difference in intensity is a factor of 1/25.
