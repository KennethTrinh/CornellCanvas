  In this question, once we find the energy density, the solution pdf says that we integrate over the x-distance of the pulse (which is w). If we have the energy density per unit length, then why wouldn't we integrate over the length of the string, which we could use the Pythagorean theorem to find.

  i.e.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Instead of:
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  \int_{ }^{ }u\ dx\ =Wu
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  we would have:
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  2\int_{ }^{ }u\ dl\ =\ 2\cdot u\cdot\sqrt{A^2+\left(\frac{1}{2}W\right)^2}
 </math>

  Thank you

  The original energy density is defined as (energy) per (unit length of the string at equilibrium).  For all our idealized string equations and analysis, we are assuming "small" displacements--small enough so that length difference between the long leg and hypotenuse of the right triangle is negligible.
