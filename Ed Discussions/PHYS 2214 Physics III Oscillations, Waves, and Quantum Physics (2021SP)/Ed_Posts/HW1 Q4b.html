 Should we be differentiating A(ω_D) to find the maximum? or is and approximate value for the resonance frequency enough?

  In problem 4b you do want to differentiate to determine the precise frequency where the amplitude is maximum.  (In effect, you will check one of the results stated in the Course Notes.)  One pro tip: if you are clever you don't need to take the derivative of the full expression for A(ω_D), just part of it -- but taking the full derivative will get you to the correct answer, too.
