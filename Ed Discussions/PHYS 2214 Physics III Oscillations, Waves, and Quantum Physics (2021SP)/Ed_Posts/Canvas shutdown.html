 I had an issue submitting the HW around 4 o'clock today and after about twenty minutes of struggling I simply emailed my TA the HW assignment before the 5 o'clock deadline. Now, after the 5 o'clock deadline, I have submitted the assignment to Canvas as it seems to be back up again for everyone. I just want it in writing that my "late" submission according to Canvas will not be counted as late considering the Canvas failure.

  One more thing -- we will be doing the grading within Canvas, so please do submit there now that Canvas is working again, even if you have already emailed your solution to your TA.

    Yes, lots of students had this problem, and we will not penalize anyone because of Canvas issues.
