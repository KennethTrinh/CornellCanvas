  Today in lecture, we talked a lot about normalization of the wave function, and in particular when it comes to the correspondence principle it gave us 2/L as the normalization constant of the wave function. I am still confused about what this is/what it means and how we got it. Can someone please explain?

  Sorry that I wasn't clear.  The normalized wavefunction for a particle in an infinite square well is $\psi_n(x) = \sqrt{2/L} sin(k_n x)$.  The $2/L$ comes so that if you take the square of the wavefunction and integrate from $x$ = 0 to $L$, the total integral will give you 1.  (Recall that the average value of $[sin(k_n x)]^2$ is equal to $1/2$ if you take the average over an integral number of half-wavelengths.)

  The end result is that the maximum value of  $| \psi_n(x) |^2$ goes up to $2/L$.

  For a classical particle bouncing back and forth between two walls at constant speed (our particle in the infinite square well) the probability density is constant and equal to $1/L$. The quantum particle has a non-constant probability density that varies between 0, at the nodes of the wave function, and $2/L$, at the antinodes. The dependence on $x$ is $(2/L)\sin^2(k_n x)$, which you'll recognize as having average value $1/L$, just like the classical particle. If the physical circumstances are such that the wiggles of the wave function are too short to be resolved, and only average properties (over several wiggles) can be measured, the result coincides with classical physics. This is what is meant by the correspondence principle.
