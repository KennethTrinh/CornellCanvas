 Is it possible for us to see the mean scores on homeworks so we can have an idea of how well we are doing in them?

  The homeworks aren't a very large part of your grade and 7 of the 10 points are given for overall effort and neatness, so the average could be less than 7, but probably is not. Don't worry about how you're doing compared to other students though; just look at your own graded homeworks and see where your mistakes are to prepare yourself for the exams
