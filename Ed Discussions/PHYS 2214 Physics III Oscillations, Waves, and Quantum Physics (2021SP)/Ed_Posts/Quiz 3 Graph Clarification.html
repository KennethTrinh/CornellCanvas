  Discussion of quiz content is not appropriate on Ed Discussions (or anywhere else) until after the submission deadline.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  From the quiz instructions: "Please take this quiz after completing the homework and coops, and take it by yourself,
  <bold>
   without discussing it with anyone else
  </bold>
  ."

  My apologies, my intention was only to clarify the graphical data that is being presented to us and not to receive help in solving the problem. I noticed that there were previous Ed Discussion posts with regards to quiz clarifcations and believed that this would be okay. Again, apologies.
