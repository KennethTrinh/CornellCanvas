 I feel like I am not reading the graph correctly because I am getting a nonsensical answer.
</p>
<p>
 Between 0.05 seconds and 0.105 seconds, there are 10 high-frequency oscillations that occur right?

  Discussion of quiz content is not appropriate on Ed Discussions (or anywhere else) until after the submission deadline.
 </p>
 <p>
  From the quiz instructions: "Please take this quiz after completing the homework and coops, and take it by yourself,
  <b>
   without discussing it with anyone else
  </b>
  ."

   My apologies, my intention was only to clarify the graphical data that is being presented to us and not to receive help in solving the problem. I noticed that there were previous Ed Discussion posts with regards to quiz clarifcations and believed that this would be okay. Again, apologies.
