 I'm confused how to go about finding the amplitude for question 1. I know the correct answer, but I keep getting .5
</p>
<p>
 If x(t) = Re(Ae^(iωt)) = Acos(ωt) = .5
</p>
<p>
 and v(t) = Re(Aieω^(iωt)) = -Aωsin(ωt) = 0
</p>
<p>
 For the second equation to be true, sin(ωt) = 0 (assuming that A and w are both non zero). But if sin(ωt)=0, then cos(ωt) = 1 or -1, so A must be .5
</p>
<p>
 Or more intuitively, at the point where the block on the spring has 0 velocity, it is turning around and so has reached its peak amplitude, right? I know that I'm missing something I just don't know what.

 Thank you for the help.

  This problem deals with an underdamped oscillator, so the general form of the position versus time is
 </p>
 <math>
  x\left(t\right)=Re\left[Ae^{i\ \phi}e^{-\frac{t}{\tau_A}}e^{i\omega t}\right]=Ae^{-\frac{t}{\tau_A}}\cos\left(\omega t+\phi\right)
 </math>
 <p>
  where here I have written a complex-valued
  <b>
   <i>
    A
   </i>
  </b>
  in terms of a real-valued A and a phase phi.  When you take the time derivative of this to determine the velocity, there will be a contribution from taking the derivative of the
 </p>
 <math>
  e^{-\frac{t}{\tau_A}}
 </math>
 <p>
  term as well as the cosine.  You can then use the initial conditions to determine A and phi.
