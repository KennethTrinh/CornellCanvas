  For #3, where we are finding L- and L+, I am assuming that it is intended for us to calculate actual values of L+max and L-max, given the value of angle 1 and max angle 2. (I don't think that the expressions for the lengths would change from #1 as they are pushed to the limiting case... thus I would need to use the given maximum angle info with nf=1.5 in order to find their actual limiting values.)

  Am I thinking of this right?

  Yes.  The film thickness $t$ will still be arbitrary, but the other quantities can be given definite values.
