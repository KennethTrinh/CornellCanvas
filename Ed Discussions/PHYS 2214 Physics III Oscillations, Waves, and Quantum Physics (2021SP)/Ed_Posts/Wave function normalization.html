  From the coop: "The correct normalization of the wave function for the particle in a box with infinite walls is A=âˆš2/L for all energy levels." and the same amplitude was given in the lecture 22 exam question slides. how is this amplitude derived?

  What it means for a wave function to be "normalized" is that if you multiply the wave function by its complex conjugate and then integrate the product over all possible positions, then the result of the integral should be equal to one.  Physically this corresponds to saying that the total integral of the probability density per unit length must be equal to one -- or in other words, if you have one particle, the total probability for that particle to be somewhere must be equal to one.  Try working this integral for one of the particle-in-a-box wave functions (times its complex conjugate) -- you will see that the factor of $A = \sqrt{2/L}$ is needed in order for the value of the integral to be equal to one.
