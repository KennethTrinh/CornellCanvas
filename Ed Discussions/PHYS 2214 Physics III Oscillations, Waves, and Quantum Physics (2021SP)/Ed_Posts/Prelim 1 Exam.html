 Hello, I was wondering if the prelims are conducted over zoom because I currently don't have a webcam and was wondering if I need to buy one.

  You don't need a webcam.  The procedure for the prelim will be the same as for the homeworks, except that you will have only a set amount of time.  We will make the test questions available on Canvas, you will write your answers, and then upload onto Canvas them the same way as the homeworks.  I'll have a Zoom session open in case students have clarification questions, but I don't plan to watch you take the exam.

  I'll make an announcement prior to the exam with more details about the timing and procedures.
