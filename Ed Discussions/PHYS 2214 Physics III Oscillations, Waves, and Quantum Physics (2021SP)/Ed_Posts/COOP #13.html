  How do we know the orientation of the "e" and "o" axes? In Coop 13 (e) it says that "ne &gt; no, whose optical axis is at 45Â°degrees to the y axis in the +x-+y quadrant". Does the optical axis refer to "o"? How do we know if +"e" is to the left or to the right of +"o"?

  e and o are perpendicular to each other. e is the parallel axis (to the optical axis) and would be oriented at 45 degrees to the y-axis, and then o is perpendicular to that orientation. ne &gt; no tells you that the wave speed and wavelength will bee smaller along the axis parallel to the optical axis.

  I'll add one more remark to Kate's good answer.  The e and o axes represent crystal planes transverse to the direction of light travel.  We sometime draw them like a vector, but if you do that then you should keep in mind that the opposite direction of the same vector is also equivalent in depicting the e or o direction.  That is, there is no +e and -e or +o and -o; there is no sign involved in specifying a particular crystal plane  (The electric field in a wave is oscillatory, so saying the speed of the wave is different for one direction of electric field polarization versus a direction 180 degrees rotated makes no sense.)  Because of this, as long as e is perpendicular to o then there is no sense in which one should speak of being rotated 90 degrees to the left versus being rotated 90 degrees to the right -- those are physically the same situations.

  It does make a difference, however, whether one particular optical axis is rotated 45 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise relative to the electric field polarization -- those are not equivalent configurations
