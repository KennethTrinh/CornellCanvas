 I am just wondering can the grader or the solution specify what part in the hw is being graded for correctness so I know where I got the points off from? I have been comparing my solution to the hw solution but I am still confused where and why I got wrong. Thanks!

  Your discussion TA is the one who grades your homeworks, so you should bring this request up with them directly
