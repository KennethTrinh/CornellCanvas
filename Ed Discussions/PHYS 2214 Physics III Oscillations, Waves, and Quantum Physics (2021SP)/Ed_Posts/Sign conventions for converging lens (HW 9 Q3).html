  If I have a converging lens, I will keep the focal length positive, and if the object if placed at a distance closer to the lens than the focal point, I should expect to get a bigger virtual image, which through drawing it out makes sense. When I go to use the 1/f=1/d0+1/di, I keep getting confused on the signing conventions though. For 3a, the focal length would be positive and the object distance would be positive, which would result in a negative value, which makes sense because the virtual image would be on the left side. But I keep getting a small value that doesn't seem to add up to what it should be.

  And for a diverging lens, we treat the focal length as a negative value, and expect a positive image distance if the image is on the left side of the lens and a negative distance if its on the right sign (opposite of how we had it for converging). Is this correct?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  edit: For both the diverging and converging lens, the image distance is positive when its to the right of the lens, and negative for when its to the left of the lens (on the same side of the object)?

  Also, in Unit 19, they say:

  When they say the image will be real (d0&gt;0), isn't d0 referring to the object, not the image, so why are these two facts being put together?

  The Unit 19 screen shot does seem to have a typo.  "the image will be real (d_o&gt;0)" is true because the object distance is positive.  More to the point, however, is that the image distance is positive:  (d_i&gt;0).

 <paragraph>
  When the image is on the same side of the lens as the object, the image distance is negative--for both converging and diverging lenses.  When the image is on the opposite (far) side of the lens from the object, the image distance is positive--this only occurs with converging lenses.

  I'll fix the typos in the notes.  Thank you for pointing them out.
