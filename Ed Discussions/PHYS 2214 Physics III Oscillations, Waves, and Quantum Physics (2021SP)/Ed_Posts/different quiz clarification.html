  In question 2 of the quiz: do we carry over the velocity from part 1, or do we carry over the "trigger at 45 degrees" condition?

  I believe that all of the conditions for question 1 carry over to question 2.  Question 2 is asking you to plot the shape of the same wave versus position at a particular time, instead of the wave shape versus time at a particular position.

  I had a question about this as well. Do we consider that the next person starts when the first person is half way done or do we consider that they start everytime the firs person is 45 degrees into completing the motion. The question is very unclear.

  The next person starts when the previous person is half-way done completing a motion, which is meant to be the same thing as passing by the 45 degrees position while moving either up or down.  (45 degrees being halfway between 0 and 90 degrees.)  That is, I see no difference between the two options you describe as different.

  In part 2, the first person's motion lasts for a total of 2 seconds and the first person's motion toggles between 90 to 0 several times so at what point does the motion start for the second person.

  The second person follows every separate up and down motion of the first person.

  ...I vastly misunderstood the problem. Starting over. Haha! (Thank you!)
