 I managed to get the numerical answers correct using the formulas, but my ray diagram does not match those answers. It only matches when I treat the right lens as a convex lens, but then that creates the final image between the 2 lens, which intuitively seems wrong. Anyone know what I could be doing wrong?

  Your upper diagram shows correctly  image of the converging lens.  This image would only form if the diverging lens were not there--I call it a "provisional" image.  One of your rays on the lower image is fine, the other is not.  The correct ray is the one that comes from the center of the diverging lens towards the "provisional" image 1.  That particular ray is unaffected by the diverging lens, so it comes from the converging lens to image 1 without refraction.  The solid ray you drew is wrong because the ray travels from left to right, not from right to left.  The horizontal ray from the converging lens should be refracted down to the right upon encountering the diverging lens.

   I've added a sketch which might help visualize how the light rays headed toward the "provisional" image would be bent by the diverging lens, and how you can extrapolate back to locate the final virtual image produced by the diverging lens.

   It is hard to know what might be the difficulty without seeing your diagram.  Feel free to post it here, or to talk with the TA in your discussion section.

    The image here seems to be 7.5cm from the eyepiece, and is inverted from the original object when it should be upright.
