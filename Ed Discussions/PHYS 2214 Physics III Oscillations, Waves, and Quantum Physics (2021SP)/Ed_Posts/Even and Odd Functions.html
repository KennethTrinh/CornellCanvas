 How is A not able to be represented as only sines if it is the same as D but shifted upwards?

  Example A has a nonzero average value, so the Fourier series will contain a constant term in addition to sine components.  A constant term is an even component (you can think of it as the $a_0$ term in the cosine expansion as in Eq. (9.4) of the Course Notes).
