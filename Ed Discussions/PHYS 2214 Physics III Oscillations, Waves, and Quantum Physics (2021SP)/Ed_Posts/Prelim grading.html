  It says the prelim had been graded and it seems like I got an extremely low score although when I checked not everything had been marked in the rubric. Does this mean the grading had been finished?

  Grading will not be completed until early next week.  Course staff intended to keep all grades hidden until then, but apparently there are "features" of Canvas that thwarted those intentions.  Be patient and don't put any stock in scores that you may see over the next couple of days.

  If one got Question 8a incorrect, but correctly executed part 8b with the incorrect velocity will they get any points?
