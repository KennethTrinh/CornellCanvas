 I noticed on a lot of the graphs for oscillations we viewed in lecture/reading notes
</p>
<math>
 \frac{t}{T_0}
</math>
<p>
 is labeled on the x-axis. Some of the amplitude decay time equations were also written in terms of
</p>
<math>
 T_0
</math>
<p>
 What does this symbol represent? Thanks!

  It's the period corresponding to the natural frequency (undamped oscillation of the system), w0, so basically T0 = 2*pi / w0
