  I'm stuck on this question and I think my issue is that I don't understand how to take the derivative of a complex function. In part b)i) I treated i as a constant:
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  \frac{dz}{dt}=iA\omega e^{i\left(\omega t+\varphi\right)}
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  but then taking Re[dz/dt] doesn't make sense to me because I was using
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  e^{i\varphi}=\cos\left(\varphi\right)+i\sin\left(\varphi\right)
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  and there's now an extra i in my dz/dt. A nudge in the right direction would be greatly appreciated, thanks!

  Your dz/dt derivative is correct.  Even though there is now an 'i' in the coefficient, the complex exponential still has real and imaginary parts.  Multiplying those read and imaginary parts by 'i' gives you an imaginary and a real part: [i*i sin(theta)] becomes the real part.
