 I know we talked about how the "missing" intensity maxima will be when the zeroes of the single slit pattern align with the maxima of the N source pattern, but is it possible for the zeroes of both to align?
</p>
<p>
 The equation for single slit diffraction minima, and then using small angle approximation:
</p>
<math>
 a\sin\theta\ =\ m\lambda
</math>
<math>
 \theta\ =\ \frac{m\lambda}{a}
</math>
<p>
 and the equation for N source diffraction minima:
</p>
<math>
 d\sin\theta\ =\ \frac{s\lambda}{N}
</math>
<math>
 \theta\ =\ \frac{s\lambda}{Nd}
</math>
<p>
 If these theta's are equal, then will the minima of both align and we won't have any missing maxima?
</p>

  You are correct that there is no requirement that the minima of the single-slit diffraction pattern align with a maxima of the N-slit pattern.  They could hit a maximum, minimum, or somewhere in between.  However, in general if you sketch an envelope function based on the amplitudes of the principal maxima in the diffraction pattern, you can still tell approximately where the single-slit diffraction pattern goes to zero.
