 I'm having trouble with part e).
</p>
<p>
 For destructive interference, I thought that the film thickness L must be an integer multiple of the wavelength inside the film, which is the incident wavelength divided by index of refraction 1.3. Then for constructive interference, just divide that by 2. I got the constructive parts g) and h) right so I'm confused why I'm getting the destructive part (e) wrong.
</p>
<p>
 Thanks!

  Not exactly, for destructive interference, its
 </p>
 <p>
  2L=(m+1/2)(wavelength),
 </p>
 <p>
  for any integer m. So the thickness is not an integer multiple of the wavelength

   There are two cases outlined in the course notes: if we have three materials, with light going from 1 to 2 to 3 and reflecting at the 1-2 boundary and 2-3 boundary, then it matters what the refractive indices are of each material.
  </p>
  <p>
   Let's assume $n_1&lt;n_2$. If $n_2&lt;n_3$ there is a $\pi$ phase change at both of the two boundaries, so Al is correct. However, if $n_2&gt;n_3$ there is a $\pi$ phase change at only the 1-2 boundary, and Anon would be correct.
  </p>
  <p>
   The first case is equations 16-6 and 16-7; the second is 16-8 and 16-9.
