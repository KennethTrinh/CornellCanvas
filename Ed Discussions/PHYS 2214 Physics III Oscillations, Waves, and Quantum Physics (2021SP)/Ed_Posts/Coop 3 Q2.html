 How is the amplitude decay time calculated from the fact that the amplitude decreases by 50% in  7 seconds?

  You want $e^{-t/\tau_A}=1/2$ for $t=7$ sec. That gives you an equation you can solve for $\tau_A$.

   You can take the term in x(t) that determines the magnitude of the amplitude (what happens to the cosine term when the function is at a peak?) and set it equal to half the amplitude. Amplitude should cancel and you have time, so you can solve for decay time.
