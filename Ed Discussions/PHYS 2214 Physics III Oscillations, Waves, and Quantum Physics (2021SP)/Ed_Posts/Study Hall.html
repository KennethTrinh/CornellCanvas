  I'm not sure what you mean by "for exam 1", but the study hall schedule is on the course homepage:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Mon. 2-4 pm, Tues. 2-7 pm, Wed. 2-5 pm, Thurs. no office hours, Fri. 3-5 pm

  There are no study halls during the exam time, but Prof Ralph will have a Zoom session for you to join during the exam time for clarification questions
