 The only item I do not have is liquid soap, I live in a dorm where there is only foam soap. Does foam soap or shampoo work?

  My guess is that as long as you can get bubbles to show up, it should be fine

   Foam soap should be fine. Try stirring some foam soap into your water until most of the tiny foam bubbles disappear. Now you're ready to make larger bubbles (lenses) by blowing air under the surface with a straw.
