 While reviewing I realized I do not really understand the difference in wave and source interference. Don't the sources we work with (like cell towers) output waves? What is the real difference?

  They are the same thing.  You can get interference of the waves emitted by different sources or from one source if the waves from that source can follow more than one path to reach a given detection point (as in N-slit diffraction or thin-film interference).  In either case, the different contributions to the total wave can add up constructively, destructively, or with some amplitude in-between.
