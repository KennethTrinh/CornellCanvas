 I am having  trouble finding the wave speeds of the short and long wave speed. when i try to calculate the wave speed  i keep getting 10 for both  which is the wave speed in the prompt. I feel like my approach might be wrong. Would would the speeds add up for y1 and y2 in y ?? what should I do to calculate the individual wave speeds?

  Wave speeds are a property of the medium.
