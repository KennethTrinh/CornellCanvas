  Could it be explained conceptually why potential energy is zero at the antinode? I see it mathematically but to me the antinode is the part which is stretching the furthest so in my mind it should have the most potential. Especially because it has the parts of the string from both sides trying to pull it down.

  I'll add one thing to Prof. Elser's response.  You stated that the antinode is the part of the string where the stretching is greatest.  This is not actually true.  We have seen that the amount of local stretching in the string is related to the square of local slope: $(\partial y/\partial x)^2/2$.  At the antinodes, $\partial y/\partial x$ is always zero, so the amount of local stretching is also zero.  It is true that the amplitude of the displacements is greatest at the antinodes, but this comes about from stretching in other parts of the string (where $(\partial y/\partial x)^2$ is non-zero), not from local stretching at the antinode itself.

  Your intuition is correct, but I think you've gotten the definition of "antinode" mixed up. This is where the $x$-derivative is zero, that is, the zero-slope parts of the plot of $y$ vs. $x$. The magnitude of the $t$-derivative is maximized at these points (but that's not directly obvious from the plot which has $x$, not $t$, on the horizontal axis).
