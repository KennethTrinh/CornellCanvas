 In the equation in the last line, why is the second cosine term negative? I see how the first cosine term is equivalent to the one above it, but not the second term. Wouldn't that last equation give a left circularly polarized wave (not a right circularly polarized one as the slide indicates)?

  Thank you.  You are right -- there is an error on this slide.  There should not be a minus sign in front of the second cosine on the last one.  I will correct.
