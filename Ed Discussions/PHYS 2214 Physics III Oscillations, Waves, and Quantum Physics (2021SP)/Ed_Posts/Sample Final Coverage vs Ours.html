 #278 says that our final will be cumulative with an emphasis on material after prelim 2, but the practice final seems to have a pretty even distribution of material with about 3 questions each for prelim 1, prelim 2, and post prelim 2 material. I was wondering if the practice final isn't representative of our final?

  The even distribution of material in the posted sample exam is
  <b>
   not
  </b>
  representative of this semester's final exam.
