 "Consider a snapshot of a transverse, ideal wave moving along the +
 <i>
  x
 </i>
 -direction with displacements along the
 <i>
  y
 </i>
 direction. At a given time
 <i>
  t
 </i>
 , which section of the string will have the
 <b>
  greatest transverse acceleration magnitude
 </b>
 ?"
</p>
<p>
 I completely understand why the "The section with largest transverse spatial curvature magnitude" is the correct answer but I don't understand why "The section with largest transverse displacement magnitude" is also not a valid answer as well. The two don't seem mutually exclusive.

  Reading Quiz 4, question 6:  The two are not necessarily exclusive, but they are not necessarily the same, either.  Imagine an 'M'-shaped wave form.  The tops of the 'M' have the largest displacement, but if these tops are gradually rounded, their associated acceleration would be smaller than a sharp valley in the center of the 'M'.  For such a shape, the largest acceleration could even be a location where the displacement is zero!
