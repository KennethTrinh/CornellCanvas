  I completely understand why the "The section with largest transverse spatial curvature magnitude" is the correct answer but I don't understand why "The section with largest transverse displacement magnitude" is also not a valid answer as well. The two don't seem mutually exclusive.

  Reading Quiz 4, question 6:  The two are not necessarily exclusive, but they are not necessarily the same, either.  Imagine an 'M'-shaped wave form.  The tops of the 'M' have the largest displacement, but if these tops are gradually rounded, their associated acceleration would be smaller than a sharp valley in the center of the 'M'.  For such a shape, the largest acceleration could even be a location where the displacement is zero!
