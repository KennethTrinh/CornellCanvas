 When we solved for the speed of light in the most recent quiz, we assumed several times that the constants of integration are zero. How can we make this assumption? In general in this class, when is it okay to make this assumption?

  If the wave is a short pulse, it will have zero amplitude and times and positions away from the pulse.  This means that the values at infinity must be zero, which is equivalent to saying that the constants of integration must be zero.
