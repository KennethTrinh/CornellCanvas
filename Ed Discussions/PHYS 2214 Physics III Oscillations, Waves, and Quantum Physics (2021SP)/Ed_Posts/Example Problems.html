  Nowhere in the readings are there any actual examples of using the methods shown in order to solve a problem. As there is no textbook, there is no example there. It would be nice to have some sort of reference of using these to solve a basic problem, as this isn't gone over well in class either. Will anything of the sort be made available?

  If you find that reading example problems helps you, then by all means do so.  Many intro physics textbooks include example problems.  One textbook with roughly the same level as our course is University Physics by Young and Freedman.  I do not have a copy at home with me so I'm not positive that they show worked example problems, but that is a place you might start.

  I do want to recommend that you not rely too heavily on reading example problems.  The intellectual skill that I want you to develop this semester is to be able to solve physics problems by applying fundamental physics principles in contexts that might not be exactly like those you have seen before.  That will come more through practice in generating your own solutions rather than by reading solutions prepared for you.
