  I tried to find the log-log slope of v = sqrt(g(lambda)/2pi) and just got 0.5 for all values of lambda.  This intuitively made sense to me because the formula for speed is just a constant times the square root of lambda, which is proportional to lambda^1/2.  So I don't understand how there can be another power of lambda that isn't 0.5 that v is proportional to?

  You have the right idea, but do it at a spot that is a bit higher up on the wavelength.
