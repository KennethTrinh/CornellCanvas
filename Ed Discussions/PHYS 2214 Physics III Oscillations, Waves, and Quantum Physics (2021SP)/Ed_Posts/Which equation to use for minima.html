  I am a little confused about which equation to use to calculate the minima (and what the difference in applicability is between these equations).
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  From my understanding, this equation gives you the locations of the minima:

  And so does this one from lecture (which strangely, was not in the Unit 14 reading?):

  Which equation do we use and under what circumstances for finding the location of the minima?

  The two equations you reference say the same thing, but from a different perspective.  "Phi" is a phase parameter that can be thought of as a 'normalized' geometric angle "theta."  So phi = 2(pi) refers to a complete 'cycle' of the interference pattern from one principal maximum to the next principal maximum.  "Theta" is a geometric angle at which some feature (minimum or maximum) occurs.  The theta difference from one principal maximum to the next principal maximum will be much less than 2(pi).

  What is the s in this equation?

  's' is an integer.  It serves the same function as the integer 'm' in the other equation.

  An integer to indicate what exactly though? I am a little confused by it and what it is counting.

  There are multiple minima between the principal maxima.  The integer 's' simply counts which minima is being referred to.  Here's an illustrative diagram for N=9

  $s$ enumerates the minima; first minimum to the right of the central maximum is $s=1$ and so on
