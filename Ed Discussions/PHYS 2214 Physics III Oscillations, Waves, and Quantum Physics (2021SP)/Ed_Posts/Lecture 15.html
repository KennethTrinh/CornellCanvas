 Why is E proportional to the width of the slit? What equation tells us that?

  At the central maximum, the contributions to the total electric field from each tiny division of the slit will add together constructively, with no phase difference.  If the slit is half as wide, there will be half as many divisions contributing to the superposition, so the total electric field will be half as big.  My annotation was meant to express this idea in terms of phasors.
