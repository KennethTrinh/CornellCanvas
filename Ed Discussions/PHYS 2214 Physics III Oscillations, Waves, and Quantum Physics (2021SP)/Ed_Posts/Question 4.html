 What are your expectations for this question? How much work do we need to show or can we use our intuition to modify the formulas learned in the lecture reading...

  I suggest including a brief description of your logic.  If you use a formula from the reading you might state why it is applicable, and if you modify it you can explain the reason it should be modified.
