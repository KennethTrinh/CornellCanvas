 for an electric field phasor in the complex plane, is the actual real magnitude of the electric field the magnitude of the complex phasor or the real part?

  It is the magnitude of the complex phasor.

   Actually, I should add a few more words of explanation.  If you are adding up waves that are coherent, all with the same frequency, each phasor vector will rotate in the complex plane at that frequency, and their sum will also rotate in the complex plane at that frequency.  If you wish to know the instantaneous value of the total electric field at some definite time, you would take the real part of the sum at that time.  If you wish to know the peak value of the electric field over the course of its oscillations, that will be given by the magnitude of the complex phasor.  At the instant when the total phasor rotates so that it points parallel to the x-axis, these two quantities are the same.

    I see, so when the rotating phasor in the complex plane is along the imaginary axis is when the observed real electric field is zero, although its magnitude (i.e. the phasor magnitude) is unchanged?

     Yes.  The total instantaneous electric field is still oscillating, so as a function of time it has a maximum positive value, then goes through zero to a maximum negative value, then goes back through zero to a maximum positive value, etc.  This is represented by having the total phasor rotate in the complex plane from the positive real axis to the positive imaginary axis (where the projection on the real axis is zero), to the negative real axis, etc.
