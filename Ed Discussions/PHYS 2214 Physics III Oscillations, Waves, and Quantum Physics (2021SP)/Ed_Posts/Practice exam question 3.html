  I got confused when checking my work with the solutions.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I had not realized that the "b" term in:
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  b\left(x+vt\right)
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  is a constant. I thought it referred to an arbitrary function called "b".
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  In the lecture notes,
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  y\left(x,t\right)=f\left(x\mp vt\right)
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  where "f" refers to a function that involves the x +/- vt term.

  Followup, if a pulse description does not involve f(x+vt) but involves b(x+vt) (or any letter other than f) could we assume that the leading letter is a constant rather than a function?

  If this sort of issue is not clear from context, you are welcome to ask for clarification.  In general, we will try to use letters like a, b, c to denote unknown constants, but I can't promise that this will be done universally.
