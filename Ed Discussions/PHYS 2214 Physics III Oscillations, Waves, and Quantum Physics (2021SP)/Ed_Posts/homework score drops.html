  I am a bit overwhelmed right now, and I think I am not going to have time to do this homework. (Or if I do, it will be very terrible and stress me out a lot.)

  Just to help myself calm down a little, can I confirm that based on the ~20% score drop policy, for 12 homework assignments, we will get
  <underline>
   at least 2
  </underline>
  of the scores dropped?

  Sorry for the non-physics question.  :')  And thank you!
