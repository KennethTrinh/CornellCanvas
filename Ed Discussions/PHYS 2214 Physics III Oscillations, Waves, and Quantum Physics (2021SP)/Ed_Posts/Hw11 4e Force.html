 In 4e, I'm having trouble figuring out how to find F ( which I think is force) of the cantilever beam, any tips?

  You actually don't need to know the force here.  If the total energy of the oscillator is equal to $k_B T$, what is the maximum potential energy from a classical point of view as it oscillates back and forth?  If you know the maximum potential energy and you know the effective spring constant (labeled by $k$ in this problem), can you calculate $y_{max}$?
