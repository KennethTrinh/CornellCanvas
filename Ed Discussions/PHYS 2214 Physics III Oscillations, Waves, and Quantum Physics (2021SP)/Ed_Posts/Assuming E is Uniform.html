 In the reading for Unit 15, when talking about N-slit diffraction, it mentions that the N source interference model assumed that the amplitude of the electric field at the screen is constant, and the only thing that varies is the phase.
</p>
<p>
 For the N-slit diffraction, it says that we cannot make this assumption - both magnitude and phase vary. Why can't we make this assumption? Is it because the slits block some of the incident light?

  The idea is that if you consider the pattern of electric field amplitude on a far screen due to one slit of non-zero width, what you will see is a one-slit diffraction pattern which does not have the same electric field amplitude at all angles.  You can still calculate the total electric field amplitude from N slits (each with the same non-zero width) by adding up the electric fields from each slit, but the contribution from the individual slits will now depend on the angle.  The end result is what is stated in Eq. (15-16) of the Course notes.  The intensity of the 1-slit diffraction pattern modulates the overall pattern of intensity, acting like a multiplicative envelope function to modify the N-source interference pattern.

  If you take the limit as the slit width goes to zero, the 1-slit diffraction pattern broadens out until in the limit the electric field amplitude from each slit is the same in all forward angles.  Therefore, for very narrow slits the problem reduces to the simpler form discussed in Unit 14.
