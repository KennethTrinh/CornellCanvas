 What is the difference between a Fourier Series and a Fourier Transform? When and why do we use each?

  The series is for periodic functions f(t); the frequencies are integer multiples of some single fundamental frequency.  The transform is for non-periodic functions f(t); a continuous spectrum containing all frequencies is needed.
