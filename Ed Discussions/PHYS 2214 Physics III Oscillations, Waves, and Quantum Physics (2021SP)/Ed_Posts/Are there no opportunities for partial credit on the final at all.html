  I understand that for the multiple choice, the likelihood of there being partial credit is low, but for a few that involved doing some math, if there was a silly mistake, does that mean I just get a 0 for the entire problem?

  The specific grading scheme for each question is still being decided.  Whether there is partial credit or not may depend on the specific question.  In any event, all exams will be graded consistently, using the same grading scheme.

  Are the exams curved? I understand the syllabus states the class is not curved but I was not sure if that also applied to the exams, in the case that mean is especially low.

  In Tuesday's lectures I will discuss, roughly, how different ranges of test scores correspond to letter grades in terms of our evaluation of the level of difficulty of the test.
