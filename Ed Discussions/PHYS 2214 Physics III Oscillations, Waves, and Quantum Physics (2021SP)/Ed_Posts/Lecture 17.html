 Brewster's angle is when the ray is fully transmitted right, but for when B is parallel? So that means that when the light is at Brewster's angle and E is parallel, this tan(theta)=n2/n1 rule that we see when B is parallel doesn't apply right? But even then, how did we conclude that it is linear?

  All of the B-parallel component is transmitted.  That leaves only (a portion of) the E-parallel component to be reflected.  If only one component is reflected, it must be linearly polarized.
