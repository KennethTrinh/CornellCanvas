  I am confused on the meaning of min/max displacement of standing wave on a string.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For multiple choices L7-16 and 17, what does it mean to have a max or zero displacement for standing wave and how does it relate to node/antinode?

  Displacements are generally measured from the equilibrium (at rest) configuration where $y(x) = 0$ at all x .  So maximum displacement means the instant when the standing wave goes farthest from the $y(x) = 0$ configuration, has an instantaneous velocity that goes to zero everywhere, and begins to turn around and head back toward the equilibrium $y(x) = 0$ configuration.  At the maximum displacement condition, the kinetic energy density is zero everywhere (because the transverse velocity is instantaneously zero), but the potential energy density is non=zero at most points.  Zero displacement means that the standing wave is at the instant of the oscillation where $y(x) = 0$ but the instantaneous velocity is not zero so that there is non-zero kinetic energy density at most positions of the string (but no potential energy density since the slope $dy/dx$ is instantaneously equal to zero).

  Nodes are the positions of the string where the displacement of the standing wave is always zero.  Their transverse velocity is always zero, so their kinetic energy density is zero, but they can have non-zero slopes $dy/dx$ so their potential energy densities can be non-zero.  Antinodes are the positions of the string that have maximum displacements and therefore the greatest maximum velocities and kinetic energy densities, but the slopes $dy/dx$ are always zero at antinodes so they always have zero potential energy density.
