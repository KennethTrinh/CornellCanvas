  Does a point of stable equilibrium refer to a point where the net force is 0 and that the derivative of the force is negative, meaning that the force is decreasing as it approaches the equilibrium point?

  Yes, stable equilibrium has 0 net force and dF/dx should be negative. I wouldn't think about it as the force decreasing when approaching the point, but rather the direction of the force when displaced from the equilibrium point. When dF/dx is negative, a displacement in the positive direction results in a force in the negative direction, and vice versa. For stable equilibrium, we want this restoring force. This kind of thinking will help you identify unstable equilibrium points as well, where now the force points in the direction of the displacement.
