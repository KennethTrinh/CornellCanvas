  Where does the formula used in the solution come from? I couldn't find it in the notes and I am not sure how to derive it. Also, why are there two thetas and what do each of them represent?

  Let's start by determining the position of the intensity zeros.  From thinking about phasor diagrams, one can see that for $N$ coherent sources the zeros occur when the phase difference due to the different path lengths associated with neighboring sources is $\Delta \phi = 2 \pi/N$.  (This corresponds to $N-1$ zeros in between principal maxima.)  For an arbitrary angle $\theta$ traveling away from the sources, the phase difference between adjacent paths is $\Delta \phi = k d sin\theta$.  The zeros of intensity therefore correspond to $k d sin\theta = 2 \pi/N$ or $ sin\theta = \lambda/(dN)$  (since $k = 2 \pi/\lambda$), and the difference between the two neighboring zeros next to the principal maximum is twice this value.

  The symbol $\theta$ corresponds to the angle at which the wave travels to reach a certain point on the screen and the symbol $\Delta \theta$ corresponds to the difference in this angle between two intensity zeros on either side of a principal maximum.
