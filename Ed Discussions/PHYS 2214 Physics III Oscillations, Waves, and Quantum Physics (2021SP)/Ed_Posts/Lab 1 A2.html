 For Lab 1 parts A1 and A2, my group and I recorded that the frequency of the damped oscillator was higher than that of the undamped oscillator, but this does not intuitively make sense to me and also conflicts with the equation for underdamped oscillators below:
</p>
<math>
 \omega^2=\omega_0^2-\frac{b^2}{4m^2}
</math>
<p>
 Is the data I recorded just off? If anyone could point me in the right direction that'd be greatly appreciated!

  Good!  Sometimes data does not agree with intuitive and theoretical thought.  The resolution may be that the intuitive and theoretical concepts are incorrect and need revising.  In this instance, however, the precision with which the damped period is measured is not precise enough for a good comparison.  Your answer to the final question in the last part of A2 could start, "I would
  <b>
   not
  </b>
  expect the results to compare as they do because..."
