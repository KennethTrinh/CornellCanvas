 If I_av=(#photons/area*time) *hf, and we increase f and I_av is the same and h is constant, wouldnt that increase #photons/area*time, and wouldn't this increase the maximum KE?

  The correct answer is C, but this actually does not have anything to do with the number of photons/(area*time).  The maximum kinetic energy depends only on the incident frequency and the work function of the metal according to $K_{max} = hf - \phi$ (where $\phi$ is the work function), so if the frequency increases then so will the maximum kinetic energy, independent of whatever happens with the intensity of the light.  This was one of the key features that allowed Einstein to understand that light transfers energy only in discrete chunks = photons.

   I think it does. The correct answer for this question should be c.
