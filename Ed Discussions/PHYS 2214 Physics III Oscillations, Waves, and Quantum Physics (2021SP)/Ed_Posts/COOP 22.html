  with power = Iav = .1W, hf = 10 eV and got that the number of electrons/second is .01 (assuming the number of photons is equal to the number of electrons) and then converted to Amps by using the charge on an electron to do the conversion. I get an answer that would just be approximated to 0. What am I doing wrong here?
