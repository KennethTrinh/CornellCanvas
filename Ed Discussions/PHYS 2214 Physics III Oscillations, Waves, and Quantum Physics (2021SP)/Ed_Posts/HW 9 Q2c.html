  On 2c, is NA the same as in 2b? If I follow this and use equation 18-22, sine of the incident angle is smaller than sine of the critical angle, making the argument under the square root negative. Is this the right path to continue down?

  NA is the same, but instead of looking directly at phi which goes from n0 into n1, you need to calculate the angle that is going from n1 to n2. You should find that as phi decreases, the angle of interest increases.
