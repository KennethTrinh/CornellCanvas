  I'm confused on how to determine the drive amplitude for part B5. It says to measure the "back-and-forth motion of the end of the spring connected to the string." Is this referring to the longitudinal wave of the spring?

  In the video titled B7, there is a close up of only the spring (driving) oscillations and not the mass. From there, you should be able to determine an approximate drive amplitude, and then compare that to the response amplitude (mass) for the following questions.
