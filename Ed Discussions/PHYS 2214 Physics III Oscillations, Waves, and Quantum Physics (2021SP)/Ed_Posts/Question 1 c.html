 In this question, we are told to use our answer form part b which was -1/2*
 <i>
  b*w^2
 </i>
 *A^2 to find a maximum. In the past, we have done this by taking the derivative. Here when I take the derivative WRT w I will get that the maximum is at w = 0 which doesn't seem to make much physical sense to me. What am I thinking wrong here?

  I suspect you might not be taking into account that the amplitude A depends on $\omega$, so you need to maximize ($\omega A(\omega))^2$.

    Why is Amplitude here dependent upon frequency?
