 When we are calculating the derivatives, are we allowed to set the x in
</p>
<math>
 u=\frac{x}{a}+\frac{t}{b}
</math>
<p>
 to be zero so then
</p>
<math>
 u=\frac{t}{b}
</math>

  If you are asking about question 2(a) and (b), the answer is yes.  Substituting in x=0 gives you a formula for the amplitude of oscillation as a function of time at x=0, from which you can work to solve for the requested quantities.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you want to know the amplitude as a function of time at other positions, you can use the same starting formula and substitute in different values of position.  That is what is meant by having a function of two variables, y(x,t).
