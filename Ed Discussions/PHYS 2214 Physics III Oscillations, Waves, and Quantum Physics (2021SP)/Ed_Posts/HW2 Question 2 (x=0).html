  If you are asking about question 2(a) and (b), the answer is yes.  Substituting in x=0 gives you a formula for the amplitude of oscillation as a function of time at x=0, from which you can work to solve for the requested quantities.

 <paragraph>
  If you want to know the amplitude as a function of time at other positions, you can use the same starting formula and substitute in different values of position.  That is what is meant by having a function of two variables, y(x,t).
