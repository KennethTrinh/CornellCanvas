 I'm confused about how the notes explain how circularly polarized waves become linearly polarized when passed through a polarizer. From what I understand, the component of the wave parallel to the polarizer passes through, but how does it shift phase to become linearly polarized?

  There is no 'shift' introduced by the polarizer.  Circular polarization consists of two electric field components, oriented perpendicularly and a quarter cycle out of phase.  The polarizer allows one of the components to be transmitted.  That component was always in phase with itself and remains so upon transmission.  It is linear because there is only one single direction (axis) along which the electric field points.  The other component is absorbed by the polarizer.  Thus, the linear polarization transmitted by the polarizer ends up with half the intensity of the incident circularly polarized wave.
 </p>

  In an alternative scenario, in which a quarter wave plate is used with the incident circular polarization to produce linearly polarized transmission, the transmitted wave would have equal intensity as the incident wave.  In this case, the plate introduces a phase shift of the two electric field components so that they both attain a maximum value at precisely the same time and location.
