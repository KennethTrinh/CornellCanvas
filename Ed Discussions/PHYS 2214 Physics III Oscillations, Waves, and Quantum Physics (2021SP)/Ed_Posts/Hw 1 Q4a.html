  I have stared at this question for quite some time and am still not sure how to do it or what it is asking, any help on what it's trying to say, where to start, or what the difference between the two different font A's is would be greatly appreciated.

  The intent of the question is for you to consider equations 2-10, 2-22, and 2-23 in the Course Notes.  2-10 is the equation given in the homework assignment; it is a complex (having real and imaginary parts) amplitude.  Show the algebraic steps involved in deriving from 2-10 first, its magnitude (equation 2-22) which is real, and second, its phase (equation 2-23) which is also real.
