  I'm having trouble with question 5a, I can't find anything in the notes about first order vs second order, and am not 100% sure what to use for lambda. Can anyone point me in the right direction?

  I believe first order refers to n = 1 in equation 15-22, with second order referring to n = 2.  I am not really sure how to explain the lambda situation without fully giving the answer away, but you should calculate the angles for each wavelength first.  Then there's one more step to get you to the final answer.  Thinking about the word "separation" helped me figure out the last step.

  I don't think that you are confused about symbols, but just in case: we use $\lambda$ to denote wavelength.
