  In Co-op 20, there is one case of a
  <bold>
   convex
  </bold>
  lens (c) in which no image is formed from the lens because the refracted rays are parallel and so never converge. Is this always the case when the object is at the focal point away from the lens?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Also, when I was drawing
  <bold>
   concave
  </bold>
  lenses it seems that this never occurs? Is there any way to set up the problem where the refracted rays from a concave lens are all parallel?
 </paragraph>

  Thank you :)

  (Also please tell me if I am mixing up concave and convex)

  Here is an image that might help you picture light rays emerging from one point at the focal plane of a convex and refracting to travel parallel to each other after passing through the convex lens.  (Think of the light traveling from right to left.)

  Here is the corresponding image for a concave lens.  In order for light rays to emerge parallel to each other after passing through the concave lens, they must start out incident from a wide range of different angles.  There is no situation for which light rays emerging from one point will pass through a concave lens and then be bent to travel parallel to each other.

  Since light rays will follow the same paths going through a lens either left-to-right or right-to-left, you can also understand what is going on in these sorts of problems by imagining that you start with a set of light rays traveling parallel to each other and ask whether they bend toward each other or away from each other upon passing through the lens.
