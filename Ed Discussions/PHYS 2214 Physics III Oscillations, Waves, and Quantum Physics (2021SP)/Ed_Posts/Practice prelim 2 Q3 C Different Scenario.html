 For this question, if the output of the birefringent quarter wave plate was horizontally elliptical in the intermediate angles instead of vertically elliptical, would that shift the above graph down vertically and over by pi? Also, would looking at the intensity as a function of the slow axis orientation be enough to produce that new graph I described?

  Second question first:  The slow and fast axes are perpendicular to each other.  So the graph's maxima at -90, 0, and +90 degrees for the fast axis correspond to 0, +90, +180 (or -180, -90, 0) degrees for the slow axis.  The maximum intensities occur at the same angles, regardless of which axis is chosen as the reference and the graph as a function of slow axis orientation would be identical to the one shown above.

  First question:  With the first polarizer vertical, the quarter wave plate transmission of elliptical polarization will always have a vertical component larger than its horizontal component (the components can be equal at 45 degrees--the circular transmission condition).  So I'm not sure which parameters of the question you are imagining would be changed to get an elliptical polarization with larger horizontal than vertical component. (?)
