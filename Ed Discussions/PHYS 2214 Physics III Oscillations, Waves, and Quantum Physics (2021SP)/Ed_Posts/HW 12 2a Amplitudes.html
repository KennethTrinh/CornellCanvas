 I'm struggling to find the amplitudes for the plane wave functions. Is the kinetic energy expression supposed to help us find that? Thanks

  You can think about the issue of normalization for a plane wave function in a couple of ways.  One is that for describing the motion of a physical particle one always thinks in terms of a wave packet made from a superposition of plane waves with different wavelengths.  A wave packet has effectively a finite extent in space so that you can normalize it, and not worry about normalizing the plane wave functions themselves.  Another point of view is just to choose to think about limiting the plane wave function to be defined over a finite region of space, rather than an infinite region, in which case there is no worry that there will be any infinities that crop up during the normalization process.  It is common for the second point of view to play mathematical tricks like assuming periodic boundary conditions for space (i.e, that space is a circle, rather than a line) so that you don't have to worry about strange behaviors at the boundary.

  For problem 2, though, Rachel is correct that you don't need to worry about any of this.  For calculating the reflection and transmission coefficients you only need care about ratios of the wave function amplitudes, so the overall normalization does not matter.

   I was told in office hours- you can represent  the amplitude  with a constant and don't need to solve for the value.

    Plane wave functions, having equal amplitude (read, 'probability') for all locations, have a "vanishingly small" amplitude.
