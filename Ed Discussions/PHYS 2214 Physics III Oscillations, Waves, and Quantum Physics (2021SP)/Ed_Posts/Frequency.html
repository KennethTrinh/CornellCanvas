 Just a general question: when a problem is talking about frequency, how can I tell if it's the "f" frequency or the "omega" frequency? I keep on getting the two mixed up because sometimes the symbols are not included in the question.

  The terminology you will encounter is not always unambiguous.  Most often 'frequency' means cycles per second, 'f'.  Omega is most often implied by the phrase, 'angular frequency.'

   In addition, if the question asks for an answer in Hz, that's 'f'
