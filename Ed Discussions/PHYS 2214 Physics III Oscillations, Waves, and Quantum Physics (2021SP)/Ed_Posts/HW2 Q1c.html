 I saw the other post that had the same question as mine, but I didn't really understand the instructors response. How is the amplitude related to w so that we need to maximize (wA(w))^2? And when I maximize this, I still get w=0 for maximum power dissipated.

  I am also currently stuck on this so I may be wrong, but I think based on the instructors response, when we differentiate the power, we have to do product rule (since w and A(w) depend on w), and thus we get one answer that is nonzero. I currently have something in terms of the amplitude A, but I'm not sure if its right since the units don't match up.

   Differentiating the power with respect to omega is a correct approach.  For A(w), see Course Notes equation 2-22.

    Since the system is strongly underdamped and we want to find the maximum power dissipated, can set ω_0 = ω_d in the 2-22 equation so that it is at resonance?

     No.  If you try this you will see that you don't get the same answer.  The procedure for finding the frequency that gives a maximum is to take a derivative with respect to frequency and determine a value or values for which the derivative is zero.  If you try substituting in values before you take the derivative, that is not mathematically equivalent.
