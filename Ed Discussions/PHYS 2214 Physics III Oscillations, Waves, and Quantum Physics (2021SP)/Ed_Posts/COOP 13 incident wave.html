 On the first question of coop 13 we say the incident wave is left circular polarized, but after using the textbook, I thought it would be right circular. I think I still have trouble understanding this difference. In the textbook it says:

<p>
 And that this is right circular polarized. So I thought that the y term being pi/2 behind meant right circular, and so I thought the indicent wave for coop 13 would be right circular because the y term has the -pi/2 coefficient. Why isn't it exactly? It seems like the textbook says something different.

  The coop 13 wave is a function of (kz-wt).  Expanded, it could be written Ecos(kz-wt)i+Ecos(kz-wt-pi/2).  At z=0 this becomes Ecos(-wt)i+Ecos(-wt-pi/2)j.  Because cosine is an 'even' function, this is the same as Ecos(wt)i+Ecos(wt+pi/2)j.  Note that the y term actually has a +pi/2 phase--it is ahead, not behind.

   Why did we change the signs of it? Is the analysis of these circular equations always to make the cos just have the omega*t and phi value, and no x,y,z coordinate? I guess I understand that if we change the signs like that and it becomes +pi/2 it would be left circular polarized, I just didn't think to do that and was analyzing it with the -pi/2

    The signs were changed in my explanation only to show consistency with the equation shown in the text.  That equation assumes +z propagation.  What ends up missing from the text equation you showed, is the direction of propagation (which is +z).
   </p>
   <p>
    The direction of propagation does matter.  Clockwise circulation in the x-y plane would be right-hand circular polarization for +z propagation, but left-hand circular polarization for -z propagation.  Simply adding a phase of -pi/2 to the y-component of the electric field gives different circular polarizations for different propagation directions.  Ecos(-wt)i+Ecos(-wt-pi/2)j is different from Ecos(wt)i+Ecos(wt-pi/2)j.
