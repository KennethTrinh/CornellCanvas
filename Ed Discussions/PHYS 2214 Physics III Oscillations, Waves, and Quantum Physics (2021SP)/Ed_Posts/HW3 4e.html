  Is this just asking about the wave speed of the smaller wavelength function that was found in 4d? How would the node speed differ from the speed of the rest of the wave?

  Yes, for this example of an
  <bold>
   ideal
  </bold>
  string the wave speeds are the same.  The moving 'nodes' [true nodes would remain in place] travel along with the long wavelength.

  These questions foreshadow what we will see in a couple weeks when studying
  <bold>
   non-ideal
  </bold>
  media.  In non-ideal media the so-called 'phase velocity' wave speed (applicable to the short wavelength) differs from the so-called 'group velocity' wave speed (applicable to the long wavelength).
