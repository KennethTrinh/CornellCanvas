 Do we get collaboration points for going to weekly discussion? How exactly are the points calculated?

  If you look on canvas:

 <p>
  Modules -&gt; Course Information/Policies -&gt; Grades

 <p>
  Up to a 3% bonus in the final course grade is available to students who make excellent contributions to collaboration, for example: (a) by working well with other students during discussion sections and labs, (b) asking and answering questions within Ed Discussions, and (c) by receiving thank-you citations on other students' homework assignments.

  I don't know how grading is done for it (I am a student) but hope this helps.
