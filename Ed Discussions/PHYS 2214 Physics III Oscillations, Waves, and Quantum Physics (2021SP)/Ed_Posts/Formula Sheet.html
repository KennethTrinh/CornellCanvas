 Will there be a formula sheet available for students that contains all the formulas we will learn in class as with most physics courses?

  For the prelims and final. yes we will provide a formula sheet for the most important formulas.  The tests will be open book, so you are also welcome to compile your own notes or formula sheets.

   That's awesome! I think most students would find it incredibly helpful if you were to post these formula sheets that are already made now to help us know which ones to use at any given time rather than wait until the prelim to know. I certainly would really appreciate it rather than scrolling through pages of notes, especially since we are unable to download the reading materials for some reason.

    I've added a formula sheet from a previous semester within a new Module: "Study Materials".  I hope this is helpful.
