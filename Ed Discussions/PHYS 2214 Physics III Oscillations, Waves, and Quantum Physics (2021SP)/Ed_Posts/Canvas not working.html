 I'm trying to upload my submission for HW3 but canvas has timed out, it seems like I'm not the only one with this issue. What should I do?

  It looks like it's down for everyone. There have been over

   12000 outage reports
  </a>
  in the past half hour

  Edit: I think it's back up

   seems like it is a server wide issue.

    Try the usual solutions: e.g. wait until Canvas allows the upload, or restart your computer.
