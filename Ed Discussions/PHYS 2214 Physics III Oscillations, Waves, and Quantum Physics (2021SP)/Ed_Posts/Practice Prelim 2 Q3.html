 I'm confused about the practice prelim's Q3 parts B and C. Particularly in part B, the solution guide says that
</p>
<p>
 " At intermediate angles, the plate will change the orientation of the linearly polarized light by an angle of 2 theta. So at Â±45, the polarization orientation becomes 90".
</p>
<p>
 It seems to me that if you were to shift a 45 degree angle by 2*45 you would get 135 degrees. This also makes more sense to me in terms of it being a pi phase shift because 135 is a rotated 45. Could you explain further the basis of how you got this answer?

  The half-wave plate changes the incident linear polarization direction by 'reflecting' that orientation across the plate's optical axis.  For example, if the axis is at 5 degrees, the original 0 degree polarization is transmitted at 10 degrees.  The 'swing' of the polarization orientation is 2x(5 degrees)--from 0 to 10.
