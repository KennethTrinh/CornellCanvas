 We found/used (2/L)^0.5 as the normalized amplitude for the wave equation of a particle in an infinite well. Is there an equation we should know for the normalized amplitude constants (A,B,C,D) of a particle in a finite well?

  As far as I know, there is no simple analytical solution for the normalization constants of a finite well, but the principle of how to determine the normalization is the same -- you want the integral of (wave function)*(complex conjugate of the wavefunction) integrated over all positions to be equal to 1.
