 The numerical answers said the perceived frequencies were 100 hz and 20 hz.  I understand 100 hz was from the answer from d (f1+f2)/2, but when taking the small frequency, I got (f1-f2)/2 = 10 hz instead of 20.  Is there a typo in the answer key or am I approaching this the wrong way?

 Thank you!

  The "slow" modulation envelope for beats goes like $s_{max}(x,t) = cos((\Delta k/2)x -(\Delta \omega/2)t)$, which has an effective frequency of $| \Delta f |/2$ or $| f_2 - f_1 |/2$.  However, you will have constructive interference of the two waves contributing to the beats and a large amplitude in the beat signal both when $s_{max}(x,t) = 1$ and also -1, so you have intensity maxima twice per cycle of $s_{max}(x,t)$.  Because of this, the beat frequency is  $| f_2 - f_1 |$, not $| f_2 - f_1 |/2$.  Please see Eq. (6-18) in the Course Notes.
