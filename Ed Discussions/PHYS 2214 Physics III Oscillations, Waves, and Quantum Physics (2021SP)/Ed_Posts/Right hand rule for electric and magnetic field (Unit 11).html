  The reading and the reading quiz (number 3 on reading quiz 11) mention using the right hand rule to determine if the magnetic field is increasing or decreasing. I don't quite remember which right hand rule this is from Electromagnetism. Could someone please explain this quiz question and/or that right hand rule?

  To define the EMF (line integral of E) around a loop you need a convention for the direction around the loop (clockwise vs. counterclockwise). There's another convention for defining which is the positive direction for magnetic field to pass through the loop (positive vs. negative flux). The two conventions are related by a right-hand rule, such as having  your fingers curl around the loop (to define EMF) and your thumb then giving the direction through the loop (for magnetic flux).

  I might get over-ruled on this, but I think it's fair to say you won't have to recall the particulars on these conventions on a 2214 exam, because those same conventions are encoded in the signs and cross-product/curl conventions of the Maxwell equations (e.g. Faraday's Law) which you can simply look up in the lecture notes.
