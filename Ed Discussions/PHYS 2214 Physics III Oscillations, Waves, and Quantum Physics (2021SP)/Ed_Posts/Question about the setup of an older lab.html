  I have a kind of unrelated question from the setup of the Standing Waves lab that we did a couple weeks ago â€” do you have any specific information about what type of microphone was used to detect nodes in the column of air?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I'm in an independent study about audio signal processing and we recently had an interesting conversation about pressure transducers vs. a microphone with a diaphragm that responds directly to air displacement. I mentioned this lab, where the microphone detected pressure nodes and not the

  displacement nodes. I was a bit confused about  the advantages of building a microphone to capture sound through pressure instead of displacement, and was wondering if you might have any information about the specific microphone used in the lab video that could help me find out more. Thanks!

  The microphones in the lab video are labeled, "RadioShack 33-3013 Philippines."  In our lab the microphones respond to pressure.  Pressure nodes occur at open ends of the tubes and an antinode occurs at the closed end of the shorter tube.  Let me know if there is more I can do to help your investigations.
