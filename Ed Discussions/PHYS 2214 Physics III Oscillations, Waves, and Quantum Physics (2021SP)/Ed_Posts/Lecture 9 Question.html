  Why is delta omega tau/2 equal to pi? I'm a little confused because in the textbook they also have delta t delta omega = 1. Is delta t always equal to half the length of the period? And then how did we get the F(w) graph? Sorry having a lot of confusion here.

  (delta omega)x(delta t)=1 applies to a Gaussian pulse.  The Gaussian pulse is the special case for which (delta omega)x(delta t) has its smallest value.  Mathematically, the product '1' relies upon "delta" being defined as the standard deviation of the pulse shape function.  In this slide, we are using "delta" rather casually--it is not the rigorous standard deviation.  Nonetheless, the qualitative idea of a narrow pulse shape resulting in a broader Fourier spectrum is still illustrated.
