  I'm a bit confused regarding how to find the phase shift (phi) in this problem. I understand the solution in the pdf, but why can't we also do it like this:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  At t = 0, we will have:
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  2.5\cos\left(\omega t\ +\ \varphi\right)\ =\ 2
 </math>
 <math>
  \cos\left(\varphi\right)\ =\ .8
 </math>
 <math>
  \varphi\ =\arccos\left(.8\right)\ =.64
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  But this isn't consistent with the solution posted that
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  \varphi\ =\frac{\pi}{4}\ =\ .785
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  (I know that the phase shift should be negative, not positive)
 </paragraph>

  Thanks you!

  The method is fine.  The value of the function from reading the graph at t=0 is not '2' but something a bit less than '2'.  The uncertainty in reading values off the graph is reflected in the uncertainty of the resulting phase values obtained.
