 It might be my problem but I could never find the HW solution besides the numerical solution after each hw was due. It will be great to me if I could compare my answers to the solution since I don't even know what part I got points off. Was there a reason why it's not published?

  You will find solutions posted in each week's "module" on Canvas, immediately following the posted assignment.
