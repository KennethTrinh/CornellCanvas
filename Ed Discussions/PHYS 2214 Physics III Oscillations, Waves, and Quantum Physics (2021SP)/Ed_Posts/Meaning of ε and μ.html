 I was wondering what ε and μ are and how do we find them? In unit 11 it said that ε = Kε_0 and μ = Kμ_0, but what are ε_0 and μ_0?
</p>
<p>
 Thank you

  $\epsilon_0$ and $\mu_0$ are fundamental constant properties of vacuum.  "Permittivity" $\epsilon_0$ is $8.85\times 10^{-12}$ C^2/(N m^2) .  "Permeability" $\mu_0$ is $4\pi\times 10^{-7}$ (T m)/A .  The coefficients K are pure numbers (no dimensional units) that differ by material and describe the factor by which the permittivity and permeability differ from their vacuum values in matter.
