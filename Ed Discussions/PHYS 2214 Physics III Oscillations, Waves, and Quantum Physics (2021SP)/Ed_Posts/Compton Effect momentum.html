  In this question, I thought that the Compton momentum was h/lambda, but that gives me answer choice B. Could someone explain how the correct answer comes out to be choice A?

  It is true that the momentum is related to the wavelength as $p=h/\lambda$, but the wavelength changes during Compton scattering so the final wavelength (and momentum) are different than the initial wavelength (and momentum).  The change in the wavelength can be expressed as written in Eq. (20-14) and (20-15) of the Course Notes.
