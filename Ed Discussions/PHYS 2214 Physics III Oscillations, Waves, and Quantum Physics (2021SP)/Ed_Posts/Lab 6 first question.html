 I'm still confused on how to convert the normal Shrodinger equation into the dimensionless form. Currently I'm trying to plug $x=a\tilde{x}$ and $t=(h/E)\tilde{t}$ into $Ψ=Ae^{kx-wt}$ and taking the derivatives. Am I going down the right path?

  Yes, the approach you describe is promising.  The wave function in your question is missing the imaginary 'i' in the exponent, but perhaps that omission is only in your posted question and not on your actual work.  The derivatives, once you have them, can be used in the Schrodinger equation.  You should be left with a collection of constants that as a group take the place of m-tilda.  Evaluate that group of constants and find they result in a dimensionless, pure number value of 0.131.

   Thank you! When I took the derivatives and plugged them into the Shrodinger equation, I ended up getting k and w in the coefficients and Ψ by itself like slide 5 of lecture 22, and was wondering what I did wrong. Sorry if this isn't the best place to ask, I had to miss my lab session to get my covid vaccine

    Here's another approach:  Rather than starting with a wave function guess, work directly with the Schrodinger equation itself.  Instead of taking the first time derivative in the equation, take the derivative with respect to the dimensionless time--that is 'dt' becomes 'd(h*t-tilda/E).  The h/E constants can be brought out from the derivative.  Similarly for the second x-derivative: instead take the derivative with respect to a*x-tilda.
