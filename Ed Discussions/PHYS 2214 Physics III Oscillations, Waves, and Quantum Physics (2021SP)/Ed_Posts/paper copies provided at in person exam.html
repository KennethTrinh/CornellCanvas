  Just to reinforce Cameron's response -- if you prefer to take the final remotely, using the some procedures as the prelims, you can do so.  If you prefer to take the final in-person in Barton Hall, you can do that.  There is no need to sign up for either option ahead of time.  I will be in Barton Hall during the exam, but will still be available via Zoom if students taking the test remotely have clarification questions.

   [If at all possible, please bring a device (such as a phone) for making images of your work and uploading them to Canvas at the conclusion of the exam.  That will make it easier for the staff to grade all exams.]

    Just to be 100% clear, if we are remote, we simply follow the final exam instructions posted on Canvas (similar to the prelims)? Should we indicate that we are remote somewhere?
   </p>

    Thank you!

     Yes, in-person final exams are only for those who need it due to internet connection issues. Everyone else follows the same rules posted on Canvas.
