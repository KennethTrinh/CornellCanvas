  I solved for the impedence (and I got a very ugly answer with 1/i's and stuff). and am not sure what im supposed to do or use for this part. All help is appreciated.

  Try evaluating the magnitude of $q(\omega_D t)$, in which process there should be no more imaginary numbers in the final answer.  (You can do this using the techniques you practiced earlier in the lab.)  Your answer should be analogous to the mechanical expression in Eq. (2-22) with the correspondence between variables listed on page 2-12 of the Course notes.  You can also compute the overall phase of $q(\omega_D t)$ relative to the driving voltage and compare to the mechanical analogy in Eq. (2-23).
