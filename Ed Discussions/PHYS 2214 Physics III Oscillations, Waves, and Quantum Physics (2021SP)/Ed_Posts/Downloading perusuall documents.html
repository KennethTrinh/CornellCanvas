 Is there anyway to download the files on perusall to view offline?

 I don't always have access to internet (edit: my internet access is fine for lecture, quiz, and homework submission, this is just about studying course material) so having access to the course material just through a pdf reader or similar on my computer would be really useful for me at least.

 i know there is also going to be a printed version available but for me I really do prefer having digital versions of class information, and while I guess I could get the printed version and just scan the pages that would be both rather redundant and tedious :/

  Just to second Cameron's response -- Normally (i.e., before the pandemic) the Course Notes are not available for free.  We have permission from the department to make them available for free when many students cannot come to campus, but they want us to do so in a way that is not simply downloadable.

  We are still planning on having printed copies of the Course Notes available for purchase at the Campus Store.  During the first lectures tomorrow I will get a rough count of students who wish to purchase them, and then it should take a few days to print and get them to the Campus Store.

   Sorry, but there is no way to download from Perusall. These course notes are copyright-protected property of the university, so we are not allowed to make them simply downloadable. You may be able to get a digital copy, but I'm not sure and cannot guarantee it.

   What is the nature of your internet access issue? It may make several things (homework and quiz submission, viewing lectures, lab participation, etc) very difficult. If you have concerns about how your unreliable internet access may affect you, you should email Dan Ralph or Glenn Case directly.
