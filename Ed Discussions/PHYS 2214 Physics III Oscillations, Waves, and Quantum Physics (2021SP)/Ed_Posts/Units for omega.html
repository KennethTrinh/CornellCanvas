  In Perusall it lists units for omega as:

  But in the numeric answers for HW1 it says:

  Which is right? Is it somehow both?

  Radians are unitless, so both are right I think.

  Professionals never write 'rad' as part of the units for an angular frequency, just 1/s. The symbol, greek omega, is sufficient to distinguish it from ordinary frequency, f, and it's always true that the former is 2pi times the latter, numerically. Hz (Hertz) can be used instead of 1/s for the units of f but this unit is not used for angular frequency. Think of Hertz as short for 'cycles-per-second'. Somebody should invent something analogous for 'radians-per-second' -- Ratz?
