 I managed to complete the substitution and reached a final relationship between the variables
</p>
<math>
 \mu,\ k,\ \omega,\ \tau,\ \Gamma
</math>
<p>
 However, we don't know anything about Gamma aside from the fact that it is not dependent on tau. How can we show that the equation one arrives at is indeed true (i.e. how do we know that y(x, t) satisfies the wave equation) without knowing the relationship between Gamma and the other variables?

  Just to build on Cameron's answer, if you can find a value for $\omega$ in terms of $k$ and the other constants in the nonlinear wave equation, but that does not depend at all on $x$ or $t$, then your solution for $y(x,t)$ with that value of $\omega$ will satisfy the wave equation.

   The $y(x,t)$ you plug in is only a solution to the differential equation if what pops out at the end is true for any values of $x$ and $t$.
  </p>
  <p>
   If you got to the end of the substitution and found $\tau x^2$=$e^{-kx}$ (as a random example), then you would know that whatever you substituted in does not solve the differential equation, because this relationship can only be true at one specific point, namely the point that solves $\tau x^2$=$e^{-kx}$.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, if you get a relationship between variables and constants which are all time- and space-independent (such as $\omega=ck^2$), then your $y(x,t)$ is good.
