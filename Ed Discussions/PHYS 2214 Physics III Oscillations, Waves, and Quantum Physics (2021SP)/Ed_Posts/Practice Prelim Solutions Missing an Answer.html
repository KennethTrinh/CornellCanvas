  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If I am not mistaken, the practice prelim answer key is missing an answer for question 3b, which is to "Express in terms of ùê¥, ùëè, and/or ùë£ the range of ‚Äúx‚Äù values of your sketch in part A) for which the string moving upwards (in the positive y-direction) at time t=0."
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Could a solution to this question be provided? Thank you!

  Why wouldn't it be 1/b instead of 1?

  I got a little confused with this question. Is b a constant that we are multiplying times (x+vt), or is b a function of (x+vt), like how y is a function of x and t?
