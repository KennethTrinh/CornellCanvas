  I think I might have a misunderstanding of what are positive and negative curvatures. Can someone help to clarify? Thanks.

  I think it is equivalent to the second derivative: if its positive it will be concave up, if its negative concave down, though I am not entirely sure... was also confused by this :/

  This is exactly right.  We will use curvature to mean the same thing as second derivative, and positive curvature means concave up.
