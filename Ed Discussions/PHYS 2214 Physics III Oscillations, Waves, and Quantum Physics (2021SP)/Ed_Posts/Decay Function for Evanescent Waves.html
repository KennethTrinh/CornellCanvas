  We have the equation for the length scale of decay for an evanescent wave as:

  I am confused on what z
  <sub>
   d
  </sub>
  is supposed to represent. I know it represents the distance in which the evanescent wave decays, but does it represent the length where the electric field decays to zero? To half its magnitude? A distance for the electric field to a decay of what fraction of the electric field's original magnitude does z
  <sub>
   d
  </sub>
  represent?

  Any clarification on this would be appreciated!

  The decay is exponential -- see the last line of Eq. (18.21) in the course notes.  $z_d$ is the length scale over which the envelope function of the evanescent waves decays to a fraction of $1/e$ of its value at the interface.
