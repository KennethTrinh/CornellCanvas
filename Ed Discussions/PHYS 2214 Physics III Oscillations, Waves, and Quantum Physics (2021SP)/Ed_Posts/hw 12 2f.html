 2f asks us to explain why the ratios ref/inc and trans/inc do not sum to 1.
</p>
<p>
 I'm having a hard time forming an answer... because I don't know why those quantities might sum to 1 to begin with. I.e. I can't think of an answer better than "Why would they sum to 1?"
</p>
<p>
 Am I missing something? What is the false assumption that we're supposed to be approaching this problem with?
</p>
<p>
 Thank you!
</p>

  I don't think you are missing anything.  As ratios of wave function amplitudes, there is no reason why they should be expected to add to one.  The "probability for transmission" and "probability for reflection" should sum to 1.  These probabilities are linked to, but not the same as, the amplitude ratios.
