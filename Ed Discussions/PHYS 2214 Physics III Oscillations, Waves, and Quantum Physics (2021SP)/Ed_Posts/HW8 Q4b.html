 I've been stuck on this problem for quite a while know and I'm not quite sure what I'm missing.
 <break>
 </break>
 I suppose just an insanity check the Laplacian for vectors is:
 <break>
 </break>
</p>
<math>
 \frac{\partial^2Ex}{\partial^2x}î+\frac{\partial^2Ey}{\partial^2y}ĵ+\frac{\partial^2Ez}{\partial^2z}k̂
</math>
<p>
 Where Ex,y,z is the appropriate component of Ē, right?
 <break>
 </break>
 but this has been giving me zero where the partial derivative with respect to time of Ē is both not zero and just a single term with constants and exponentials. As such, I can't quite reason how that partial could be zero regardless of what γ and ω are :/
 <break>
 </break>

  The general Laplacian actually involves 9 terms, not just 3.  Conveniently (and intentionally) only one of the 9 terms is non-zero for the scenario of the homework question.
