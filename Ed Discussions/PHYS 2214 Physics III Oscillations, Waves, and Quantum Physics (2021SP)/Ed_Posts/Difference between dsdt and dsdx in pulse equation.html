  I'm having a hard time distinguishing between ds/dt and ds/dx in the pulse equations and am not sure why they are different and when eeach one maybe used (for instance in finding where a peak would occur). I know ds/dt is the transverse velocity and and ds/dx is the spatial slope but am not sure what that exactly means.

  The displacement, 's', of the medium through which a wave propagates is described mathematically by a function of two variables--location and time--s(x,t).  The partial derivatives of this function ds/dx and ds/dt have the meanings you mention.  The first, ds/dx, relates to the 'shape' of the medium--how it is distorted from its equilibrium position.  The other, ds/dt, relates to the motion of each tiny element of the medium.

  But i'm still confused on how for instance a point of maximum transverse velocity (ds/dt = 0) is the same as the same point where ds/dx = 0 as well)

  I recommend drawing a picture.  Draw a wave pulse of some sort s(x) that has a broad peak where the slope of the waveform is zero (ds/dx = 0).  (Imagine we are dealing with a wave on a string.)  Then draw the same wave shape at a slightly later time, shifted a tiny bit along the x axis.  You will see that the two curves almost overlap near the region where ds/dx = 0 -- the vertical distance between the two curves will be almost zero close to the broad peak.  Since each little section of the string can only move vertically, this means that the string in the region of the wave's peak is almost stationary at the moment you are considering, so  the vertical velocity of the string ds/dt is almost zero in that region. too.
