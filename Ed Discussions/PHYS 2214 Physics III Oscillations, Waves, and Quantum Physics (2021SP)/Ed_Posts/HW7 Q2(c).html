 My friend and I were working together on this problem, and the way she approached the problem appears correct to myself and her, but it does not produce the answer indicated in the numerical answers.
</p>
<p>
 The general strategy was to figure out the theta between two maxima, and divide 180 degrees (or pi radians) by the theta between two maxima as a way to obtain the total number of maxima between theta = -90 degrees and theta = +90 degrees.
</p>
<p>
 However, when calculating the theta between two maxima, it turned out to be extremely small such that when doing pi radians divided by this value of theta yielded an answer far greater than the numerical answer provided. We have looked over the math a couple times and it was correct, so we figured that there must be some issue with the methodology.
</p>
<p>
 Is there some flaw in the general strategy that we overlooked?

  The 'flaw' may be you are conceiving of the interval between maxima as a constant angle, when the interval is constant, not in angle, but in sin(angle).  For small angles (near zero) there is little difference between the two concepts, but at larger angles (near 90 degrees) equal differences in sin(angle) correspond to larger and larger differences in angle.
