 I am pretty clueless on what's going on in problem 6, 7, 8. The explanation were not too helpful.

  Is your posting referring to a pre-lecture reading quiz?  If so, which one?

   Can today's quiz be ungraded? I think there was a rule that we couldn't have anything due on the Tuesday after wellness days.
