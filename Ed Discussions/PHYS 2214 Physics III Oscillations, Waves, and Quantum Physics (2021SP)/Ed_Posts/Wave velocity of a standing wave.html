 Since wave velocity isn't the transverse velocity and a standing wave isn't moving, is the wave velocity the velocity of the 2 waves that make up the standing wave?

  The pattern of motion in a standing wave doesn't move along a string -- the nodes stay fixed.  Therefore, strictly speaking, I would not say that there is a wave speed associated with a standing wave.

  However, you can think of a standing waves as the superposition of two traveling waves with the same wave speed and equal amplitudes traveling in opposite directions.  If the form of the standing wave is what is written in Eq. (7-3) of the course notes, that starting wave speed is equal to $\omega/k$ as one might expect.
