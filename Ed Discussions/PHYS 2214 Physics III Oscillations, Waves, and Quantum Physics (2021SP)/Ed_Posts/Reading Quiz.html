  How can the transmission probability be 0, if the probability of a particle being at past x = 0, is still non-zero until it exponentially does decay to 0.

  Think of the probabilities of reflection and transmission as "the probability of the particle propagating away from the boundary in the positive (for transmission) or negative (for reflection) directions."  The non-zero probability density beyond the barrier does not translate into a non-zero probability of the particle propagating away from the barrier in the positive-x direction.  My own non-rigorous mental picture is that the reflection process does not occur exactly at the energy step, but occurs in a finite region that is centered on the step.  Perhaps this is (very loosely) like jumping on a trampoline--there is a 'reflection' process involved (downward motion turn into upward) that occurs not only at the trampoline's equilibrium elevation, but extends below that level as well.  Still, there is zero probability of 'transmission' downward beyond the trampoline.
