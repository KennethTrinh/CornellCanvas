  On the home page, it says Lecture 23 has U24(A-C), lecture 24 has U24(E-H), so section D on coulomb potentials isn't here. I assume it's a typo since coulomb potentials show up on the reading quiz. Just wanted to let the instructors know

  Thank you.  You are correct that the reading for section D should be included in the reading assignment.  I'll correct the typo.
