  You're being asked for the "wave speed", the speed that an arbitrary wave pattern will propagate (not the speed of the medium at a particular point). From the form of the displacement, how it depends on $x$ and $t$, you can tell this is an instance of an "ideal traveling wave". There is a simple way of inferring the wave speed whenever the wave fits that description.
