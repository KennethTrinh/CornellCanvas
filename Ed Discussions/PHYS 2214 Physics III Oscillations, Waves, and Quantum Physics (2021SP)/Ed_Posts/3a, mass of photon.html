 I'm having trouble finding the mass of a photon to use in the formula for energy. Any tips or pointers?

  The mass of a photon is zero, but in this problem the mass is referring to the H atom mass.  (It is asking you to calculate the energy of a photon with energy effectively equal to the recoil kinetic energy of the atom.)
