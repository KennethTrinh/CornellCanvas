 I can't seem to access the notes linked on Canvas... when I click on the link it tells me to log in to Perusall, and once there it tells me I need to join the course with a course code. However, I read through all the course information on Canvas and couldn't find a course code... am I missing something?

  Yes, if you click the link on the left side navigation first you will be logged in and able to click embed links. You can also navigate to the reading from the perusall home

   This is not something that I encountered when I tried things out as a test student.  Did you click first on the Perusall tab on the left side of Canvas, before you tried clicking any of the embedded links within Canvas?  Also, are you using the same Canvas account as the one enrolled with the class?  (One other student had that problem.)

   If neither of those ideas fixes the problem, could we arrange a Zoom session so that I can see what happens when you try to access the reading?
