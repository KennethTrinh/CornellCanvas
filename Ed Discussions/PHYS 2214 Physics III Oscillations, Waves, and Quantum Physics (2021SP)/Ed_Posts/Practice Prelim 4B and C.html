  I'm having trouble understanding how the phasor diagrams in 4b and c were obtained. What steps would I take to draw these diagrams?

  See also #218.  Phasor diagrams for sin(theta) = 0.2 or 0.4 must be consistent with zero intensity, which is zero electric field.  For a single slit, we imagine an uncountable number of extremely tiny point sources distributed across the slit width.  It is impractical to represent all the heads of the phasor arrows on our diagram, so instead of drawing a many-sided polygon that closes on itself to get zero intensity, a smooth circle that closes on itself is drawn to get the zero at 0.2.  The phase difference of the 'first' source to the 'last' source is 2pi, corresponding to going around a circle once on the phasor diagram.  At 0.4, the curve of phasor sources wraps around twice, corresponding to an overall phase difference of 4pi, which is going around a circle twice on the phasor diagram.  The net phase difference at 0.1 is half what is was for 0.2--a difference of pi between the 'first' and 'last source.  For 0.3, the phase is intermediate between 0.2 and 0.4, so this curve is one-and-a-half circles.  The feature that remains the same for all the phasor diagrams in this question, is the length of the arc/circle drawn.
