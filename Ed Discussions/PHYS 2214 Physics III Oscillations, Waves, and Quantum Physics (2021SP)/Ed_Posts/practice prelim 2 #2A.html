  I am having trouble solving for the index of refraction for question 2A. The only formula I can find that seems relevant is
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  v=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu\epsilon}}=\frac{c}{n}
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  However, I am pretty sure that it is incorrect to use the permittivity and permeability constants for free space as I'm assuming this is not supposed to be free space- so how do I find mew and epsilon?

  So I came up with another approach but it is not giving me a reasonable answer. I figured since we know omega and k, I could solve for frequency with f=w/2pi and wavelength with k=2pi/lamba Then I thought I could perhaps use v=lamba*frequency to find the velocity and then solve for n with v=c/n. Why doesn't this work?

  This is a correct approach.  If you evaluate the phase velocity $v = \omega/k = (7.5 \times 10^4 (1/s))/(2.5 \times 10^{-4} (1/m)) = 3 \times 10^8$ m/s.  This is the speed of light in vacuum, so with $v = c/n$ you would get simply that $n=1$.
