 "If you want to “scan” your beam in (d) between q= -90°and q= +90°, between what values should you vary phi?"
</p>
<p>
 From problem 2e, I'm not sure what "scan" means here.

  The angular direction of the principal maximum depends upon the phase imposed.  If the phase is zero, the angle is zero--perpendicular to the line along which the sources lie.  For a non-zero phase the angular direction will be some angle other than zero.  Suppose you had a phase 'knob' to vary the phase.  What range of phase choices would result in being able to choose any angular direction of your choice between -90 and +90 degrees?
