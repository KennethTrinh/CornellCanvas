 I am so stuck on the last question of Coop 9 and don't know where to begin. Does anyone have any tips?

  Total energy involves integrating an energy density over a pulse-width distance.  For our triangular pulses, the energy densities are generally constant values, so the integration can be done by multiplication of the energy density and the pulse-width distance.

 <p>
  The potential energy is more straight forward since the pulse dimensions allow slope calculation and tau is given.  Use u_p = (1/2)(tau)(dy/dx)^2
 </p>
 <p>
  Kinetic energy is a bit trickier.  Use u_k = (1/2)(mu)(dy/dt)^2.  The pulse equation permits dy/dt = v(dy/dx).  Even though wave speed v and mass density mu are not specified, the relation of wave speed to tension and mass density provides a useful equivalent.  v =SQRT(tau/mu)  -&gt;   (v^2)mu = tau
 </p>
 <p>
  The other tricky bit is to be sure to use superposition (where applicable) for the slopes and the string velocities to get the resultant slopes and velocity

  calculating the energy densities during overlap.  Slopes and velocities superimpose; energies do not superimpose.
