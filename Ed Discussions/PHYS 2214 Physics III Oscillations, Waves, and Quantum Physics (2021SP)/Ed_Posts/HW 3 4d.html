 I'm not completely sure why 4d (i) and 4d (ii) would have different wavespeeds since I thought wave speed was only dependent on tension and mass/unit length. Can someone help clarify the problem for me?

  You are correct.  In the cases we have considered so far, the wave speed $v= \omega/k$ is just a constant, depending only on the tension and mass density.  Later in the course, we will consider cases in which there can be dispersion dispersion, meaning that the quantity $\omega/k$ might not be the same for all frequencies.  In that case, the two velocities $\bar{\omega}/\bar{k}$ and $\Delta \omega /(\Delta k) \approx d\omega/dk$ that enter into our consideration of beats might not be the same, but we will come to that later.
