 Today (May 1st) is a nice and sunny day but I've tried this experiment with two different pairs of sunglasses and I do not notice any difference when turning my head looking perpendicular to the sun's rays.
</p>
<p>
 I was under the impression that all non-reflective sunglasses are polarized; does this mean that not all sunglasses are polarized? And in this case, should I just consult another classmate who did notice something (and properly credit them, of course)?

  An easy way to check if they are polarized would be to hold them up to your computer screen and see if you notice a difference at different angles (it should black out the screen at one angle if it is polarized). Not all sunglasses are polarized, it is a chemical treatment done to the lenses that usually increases the price of the glasses, so a lot of sunglasses are not polarized (just tinted).

  Very good answer from Andreea! If you are a camera buff -- or know one -- you can try a polarizing camera filter.
