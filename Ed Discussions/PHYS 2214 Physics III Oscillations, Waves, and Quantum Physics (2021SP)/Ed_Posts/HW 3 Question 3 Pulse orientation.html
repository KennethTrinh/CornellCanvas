  I've gone through question 3 and think I've done everything alright, but I've gotten a little confused.
  <break>
  </break>
  Because the question stated that both triangle pulses have the dimensions of +A for height and W for width I imagined them as both above the string.
  <break>
  </break>
  Thread #77 seems to suggest however that the pulses are on opposite (vertically speaking) sides of the string.
  <break>
  </break>
  This I think keeps most of the answers the same but I think would affect our sketches for part c, though am not entirely sure about this point....

  I wanted to come to office hours today about this question but I couldn't make it :/

  You are correct that the problem is set up so that the pulses are on the same side of the string.  In this case at the instant of complete overlap the displacements add up to a large value, but when you add the transverse velocities their sum is zero.  So the kinetic energy is instantaneously zero upon complete overlap for the two pulses on the same side of the string, not for pulses on opposite sides of the string.  (I suggest that you graph out the transverse velocities versus position before overlap to see how this works out for yourself.)
