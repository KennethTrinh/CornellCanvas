  Quick question -- just wanted to confirm that all lab sessions are online? I'm relatively sure this is true but was confused because I thought I remembered seeing somewhere that online labs were only for remote students. Thanks.

  All the labs in Phys 2214 are online this semester.  The first ones start tomorrow.
