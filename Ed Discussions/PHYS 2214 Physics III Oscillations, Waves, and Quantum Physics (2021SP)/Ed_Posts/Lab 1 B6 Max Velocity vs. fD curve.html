 I'm having some trouble visualizing this relationship. I know I can differentiate the expression for x(t) w.r.t. t in order to get an expression for v, and then I know what the max. v will depend on, but since there is an amplitude and a frequency in this expression, I am not sure what the shape of the resulting vmax vs. drive frequency curve will look like. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.

  Yes indeed,  vmax = A(omega) * omega.  Note that v_max is the product of the amplitude function (that depends upon the variable omgea) and the frequency omega.  Think about what happens when you multiply the 'A' and 'omega' curves together.  Can you do this qualitatively, or visually?
