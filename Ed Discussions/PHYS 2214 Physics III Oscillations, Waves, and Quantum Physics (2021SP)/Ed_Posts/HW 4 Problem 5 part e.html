 What computer program is recommended to solve part e of this problem? I know matlab has fft but that doesn't seem useful for expanding the given fourier series.

  Refer to page 9-8 in the Course Notes.  Equation 9-22 includes the requested coefficients.  Note that each coefficient has an integer n in it.  The question asks for values when n is 0 to 19.  Many spreadsheet applications (e.g. Excel) make it easy to enter an equation once and then evaluate that equation for different values of its parameters.  A Fourier transform calculation is not needed here, because that has already been done and outlined in the Course Notes.

   I'm a bit confused on what to do with the cosine term of Eq. 9-22 in the lecture notes for this question. I have an expression set to calculate for n=1,2... 19 but am not sure how to find the frequency or how the time of this oscillation factors in, since we are only given pulse width/fixed T.

    Nevermind I see now this was a dumb question, It's asking for coefficients
