 Clarification question on Quiz 4:
</p>
<p>
 For question 3, the question mentions that "In the first-harmonic mode of oscillation the compound string has a node at x = 0", but question 1 says that "When oscillating in its fundamental mode, the compound string has an anti-node at x = 0". As an answer to one of the previous threads on Ed, it was mentioned that the first harmonic is the same thing as the fundamental. I was wondering if the questions were referring to the same scenario or not, and if they are, wouldn't they be contradictory?

  Oops!  You are correct that question 3 in the quiz should be re-worded.  Question 3 is meant to refer to the next mode above the fundamental mode in frequency, not the fundamental mode.

   So question 4 is also asking about the next mode, right?

    Questions 3 and 4 refer to the same mode, the one for which the form of $y(x,t)$ is given in question 3.
