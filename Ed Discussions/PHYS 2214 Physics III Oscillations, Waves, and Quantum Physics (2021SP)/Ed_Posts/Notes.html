  The Physics Office plans to start printing the Course Notes Thursday, and they should be carried to the Cornell Store soon afterward.  But the Store doesn't have them yet, and there was no printed version of the notes last fall so I doubt the Store has any leftover older version.

  I'll post an announcement on Canvas when the printed notes become available for purchase.
