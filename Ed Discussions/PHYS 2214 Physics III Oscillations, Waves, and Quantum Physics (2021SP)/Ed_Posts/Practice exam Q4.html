  I'm a little confused on how the pink part was obtained. If i understand correctly, it is part of the transmitted wave, but why is it not also scaled to be 1/3 of the incident width? Also, if it is part of the transmitted wave, how is it to the left of the boundary point?

  The pink part you have drawn is on the incident part of the string, and it can be computed as the sum of part of the incident pulse and part of the reflected pulse.  The upper dashed line is the trailing edge of the incident pulse at t = 0.1 seconds.  The lower dashed line shows the leading edge of the reflected pulse moving from right to left.  You can calculate its amplitude as R x (incident pulse amplitude), where R is the reflection coefficient, which in this case is negative -- and the shape follows from its motion in the opposite direction compared to the incident pulse.  The pink line (and everything to the left of the junction with the second string) is the sum of the two dashed lines.  (Note that the reflected wave amplitude is negative -- corresponding to an inverted reflected wave, which is accounted for with a negative value of the reflection coefficient R.)
