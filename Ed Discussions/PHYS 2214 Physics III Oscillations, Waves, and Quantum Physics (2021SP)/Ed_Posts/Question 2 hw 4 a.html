 For C9, does that mean the 9th harmonic

  Pipe length is based upon the fundamental resonant frequency.

   So we should consider c9 to also be a fundamental frequency. I'm not completely sure who this comment answers my question about what harmonic c9 falls into.

   The question actually asks for 4 lengths.  First, for pipes open at both ends, what is the length needed for 16.35 Hz and what other length is needed for 8371 Hz?  Next, for pipes closed at one end and open at the other, what are the two lengths that correspond to the same two frequencies?

    I see, but I'm a bit confused on what the n would be for say a freq of 8371 since the n's are all odd in the first instance

     The fundamental frequency corresponds to the lowest possible resonance frequency in each geometry.  By the way we have defined the $n$'s, this always corresponds to $n=1$.

    No.  The 9th harmonic overtone would be a frequency 10x that of the fundamental 16.35 Hz of C_0, or only a frequency of 163.5 Hz.  Each subscripted 'C' represents a doubling of frequency from the preceding 'C.'  So there are nine factors of 2 (2^9) relating C_9 to C_0.  (16.35)x(2^9)=8371

     Then I'm a bit confused as to what the question is asking when it asks for 2 lengths
