  Why is the I_0 halved after the polarizer at 0 degrees? I thought it was halved when it entered as unpolarized?

  It is halved in both cases you mention.  For a circularly-polarized wave traveling in the $\hat{z}$ direction, you can write the wave amplitude initially in the form $\vec{A} = \hat{x} A_0 cos(kz - \omega t) \pm  \hat{y} A_0 sin(kz - \omega t)$ so that the total vector magnitude is always $A_0$ and the average intensity is proportional to $A_0^2$.  After passing through a linear polarizer along the $\hat{x}$ axis, the wave amplitude would be just $\vec{A} = \hat{x} A_0 cos(kz - \omega t)$, so that the instantaneous intensity would be proportional to $(A_0 cos(kz - \omega t))^2$ and the time-averaged intensity would be proportional to $A_0^2/2$ (from taking the time average of the $cos^2(kz - \omega t)$).  So the intensity is reduced by a factor of $1/2$ in this process.
