  I just saw that the requirements for the physics major have now added a new class PHYS1110 Intro. to Experimental Physics. If we already took a physics class in the past that had an in-person experimental lab, do we need to take this? Any help is appreciated

  If you have already completed (or received credit for) 1112/1116 and 2213/2217 in your studies, you need not take 1110.  This new lab course is for students who take the new versions of the first two semesters, which will not have lab components.
