  In accordance with the universityâ€™s policy of no assignment to be due the day immediately after wellness days (Tuesday, April 27), could the grade for the Lecture 22 reading quiz be excused (even though I know we get to drop a few reading quizzes)?

  If this does get excused could the people who already did it keep the grade? I would prefer to have more reading quizzes so that a larger number of my bottom 20% reading quizzes get dropped.

  The course policy is that we will count only the best 80% of your reading quizzes, which means you are already free to skip 5 reading quizzes with no penalty at all to your course grade.  Even if for some reason you have already skipped 5 quizzes, skipping one more will affect your course grade by only 0.2%.

  We supported the wellness days in terms of homework and quizzes, but it is an important part of a flipped course like Phys2214 that students prepare for each lecture by completing the reading beforehand.
