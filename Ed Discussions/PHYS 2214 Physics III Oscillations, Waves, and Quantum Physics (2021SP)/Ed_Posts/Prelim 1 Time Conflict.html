 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 I am writing to inform you that prelim 1 on March 25th at 8:30pm EST ends up being at 5:30am in my time zone. As this is a very inconvenient time for me to give an exam, I was wondering if there was another time slot to take the prelim for people in different time zones. Can you please let me know? Thank you in advance!
</p>
