 Based on the numerical answers, I can tell that 20Hz is the Note Frequency (Have this from my notes) and that 90Hz is the beat frequency.
</p>
<p>
 What is the difference between the note and beat frequencies? And why/how do we perceive both of them?

  Here is a good video that shows how I like to think about beats:

  </a>
  <break>
  </break>
  but in short, I think the easiest way to think about (for this question) is that the high frequency wave is the main "sound" you hear while the low frequency wave is what is modulating the volume/amplitude (you can see that very nicely in the video I linked above.
  <break>
  </break>
  A more proper physics way to think about it is that the main "sound" you hear is the average of the two frequencies while the amplitude modulation is the difference in the frequencies (by knowing the two original frequencies you can thus identify which is the main "sound" and which is modulating the amplitude).

  Hope that made sense!

  Addendum: in the video (and much like we saw in the reading quiz) the guitarist is trying to get the beat frequency as low as possible ==&gt; which indicates the the two strings are playing the same frequency ie their difference is &lt;&lt;1 ie and thus the amplitude pulsing you here is nonexistant ie the two strings are in tune with each other
