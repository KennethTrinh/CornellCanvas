 Should the z-component of the electric field equation have a negative exponent? I can't find how the electric field decays along z with this equation as is.

  Yes.  If the amplitude of the electric field decays as the wave moves in the +z direction, $\gamma$ will need to be negative.  You can also have solutions with positive $\gamma$ that correspond to an exponentially-decaying wave moving in the -z direction.

   Does the phrase "propagating in the z-direction" imply that the wave is strictly propagating in the +z direction, or is it a general phrase implying that the wave may be propagating either in the -z or +z direction?

    If the wave amplitude gets smaller when going in the direction of increasing $z$ then $\gamma$ is negative, and if the wave amplitude gets smaller when going in the direction of positive $z$ then $\gamma$ is positive.
