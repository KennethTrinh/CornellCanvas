  I think I remember someone mentioning that the lecture notes "textbook" for PHYS 2214 might be printed and sold at the Cornell store for students who prefer a physical version to read from. Is this still happening? And will it be available to purchase online from the Cornell store for remote students? Thanks!

  Yes, my plan is to try to get a rough count of students who want a printed copy of the Course Notes during the first day of class, and then they can be printed relatively quickly to buy through the Campus Store after that.  The department says that the price should be in the $70/copy range.

  I'm not absolutely sure about shipping to remote students, but the campus store does offer shipping on most items, so I am pretty sure the answer is yes.  I'll check on that after the store opens later this morning and post another response.

  Is there any update on this? Failing that, is there any reference book you recommend?

  My calls to the campus store have been going to voicemail, but their website talks about shipping, so I'm sure that shipping will be possible.
