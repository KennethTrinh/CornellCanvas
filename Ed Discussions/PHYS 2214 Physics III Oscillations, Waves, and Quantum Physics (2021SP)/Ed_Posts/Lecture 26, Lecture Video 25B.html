 There seems to be a discrepancy in the videos/lecture notes. This screenshot from the lecture video 25B says that deltaE ~ hbar/deltat but the lecture slides for class has a factor of 1/2 as well. Which one is the correct equation?

  The most precise inequality involves h-bar/2.  In the slide, the '~' symbol is meant to be interpreted as, "order of magnitude," in which sense the factor of 2 is not important.
