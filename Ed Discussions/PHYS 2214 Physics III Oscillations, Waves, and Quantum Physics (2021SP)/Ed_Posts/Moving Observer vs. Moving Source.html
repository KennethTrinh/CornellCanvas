  I understand why mathematically, using the equation
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  f_o=f_s\frac{v+v_o}{v+v_s}
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  a moving observer traveling towards a stationary source would produce a greater observed frequency than a moving source traveling towards a stationary observer at the same speed.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Mathematically, this makes perfect sense.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Conceptually and intuitively, however, I fail to understand why there is a difference at all. Why should it matter whether the observer or the source is moving when they are ultimately approaching at the same rate?

  The difference is that there is a medium through which the sound wave is traveling, and the velocities of the source and observer relative to the medium matter, and not just their velocity relative to each other.

  One example where you can see that this is true is when the source or observer is moving close to the speed of sound and the other is at rest.  As the source velocity increases to approach the speed of sound, the wavecrests moving in the forward direction relative to the source get closer and closer together, meaning that the frequency as measured by the observer increases and increases until it diverges to infinity when the source reaches the speed of sound.  (This adding up of wave crests corresponds to a huge pressure spike and a sonic boom.)  On the other hand, if the source is at rest and the observer approaches with a velocity increasing to near the speed of sound, the frequency that the observer sees is just $(v_{wave} + v_{observer})/\lambda$ (with a fixed value of the wavelength $\lambda$), which is an increasing function but which does not diverge to infinity when $v_{observer}$ reaches the speed of sound.
