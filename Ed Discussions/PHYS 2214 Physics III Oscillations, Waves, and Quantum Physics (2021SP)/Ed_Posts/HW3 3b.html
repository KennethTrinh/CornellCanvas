<p>
 when the two waves completely overlap, is it correct to say that the total kinetic energy is zero?

  Yes.  Alternatively, consideration of the potential energy due to slope at the instant of overlap includes all the original energy of both pulses.  Conservation of energy would then imply kinetic energy is zero.

   Yes.  There are multiple lines of logical reasoning that lead to this

    kinetic energy depends on the transverse velocity, so when the two waves overlap, the total transverse velocity is zero?
