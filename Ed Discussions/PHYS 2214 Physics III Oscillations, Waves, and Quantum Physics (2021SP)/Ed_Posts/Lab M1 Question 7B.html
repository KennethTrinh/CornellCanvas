  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I'm stuck on Question 7b from the Lab M1. I am not sure on how to approach it, even with my answer to 6c (which I've written below). Any hints would be appreciated

 <math>
  x\left(t\right)=A\cos\left(wt\right)e^{-\frac{t}{\tau}}

  The form of the differential equation for the RLC circuit is the same as the form of the differential equation that we were working on in question 6. So, the form of the solution will be exactly the same, too - the only thing that changes is the details.

  There are at least a couple of approaches that will work.  You can take the 2nd-order differential equation that you wrote down in part 7a and use the same mathematical approach that you used earlier in the lab: assume a complex valued charge $q(t) = q_0 e^{\alpha t}$ and find values of $\alpha$ that can satisfy the differential equation.  Alternately, you could examine how the differential equation in part 7a corresponds to the mechanical-oscillator differential equation you solved earlier by renaming some of the parameters (e.g., the list of "equivalent variables" on page 2-12 of the Course Notes might be useful) and make use of your previous solution by just inserting the appropriate renaming of parameters.
