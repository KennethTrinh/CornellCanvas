  When you say: "Express your answer in terms of h'(u) = dh/du" do you want us to write our final answer with actual u in the answer or do you want us to substitute our value for u into the final equation?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  i.e.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If u = (a+b+c), would you prefer
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <bold>
   h(u) = 20 * dh/du
  </bold>
  (and then we may leave a note saying u = a + b + c)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  or
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <bold>
   h(a+b+c) = 20 * dh/d(a+b+c)?
  </bold>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Or does this not matter?

  I think either answer should be acceptable.  The problem was phrased this way mostly just to guide you to use the chain rule in evaluating the derivatives.
