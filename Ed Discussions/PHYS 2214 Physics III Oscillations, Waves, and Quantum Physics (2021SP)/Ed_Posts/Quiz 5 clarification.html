 When you say: "Express your answer in terms of h'(u) = dh/du" do you want us to write our final answer with actual u in the answer or do you want us to substitute our value for u into the final equation?
</p>
<p>
 i.e.
</p>
<p>
 If u = (a+b+c), would you prefer
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  h(u) = 20 * dh/du
 </b>
 (and then we may leave a note saying u = a + b + c)
</p>
<p>
 or
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  h(a+b+c) = 20 * dh/d(a+b+c)?
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 Or does this not matter?
</p>

  I think either answer should be acceptable.  The problem was phrased this way mostly just to guide you to use the chain rule in evaluating the derivatives.
