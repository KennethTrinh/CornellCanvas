  I was reading the notes for Unit 7 and saw that the equation below had a square. Should phi go in the square?

  Curse Microsoft Word!  (The recent versions of the software are incompatible with the older version with which the Notes were originally written, and some of the symbols got garbled.)  I caught most of them, but likely missed a few in addition to this one.  I'll fix it in the electronic version of the Notes.

  If you see other examples of symbol corruption, please post on the discussion board and I will fix them.
