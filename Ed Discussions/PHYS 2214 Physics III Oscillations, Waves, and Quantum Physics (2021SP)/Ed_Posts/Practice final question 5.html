  There are different ways to recognize this.  The way I generally favor is to realize that if you have $n$ slits then there will be $n-1$ points of zero intensity between the principal maxima in the diffraction pattern.  In the diffraction pattern shown, there is only one zero (with no smaller peaks) in between neighboring principal maxima, so $n$ = 2.
