 The phi for the 4B would be pi right? And for c 3pi? But I am confused why the phasor diagrams have curves in them, I thought it was always a straight vector

  If you have infinitely many infinitesimal phasors, as you do in this situation, their phase will vary continuously so it is not so useful to think about the phase difference between adjacent phasors.  However, you can still think about the total phase difference between the first phasor and the last one.  At the first zero of the diffraction pattern (at sin($\theta$) = 0.2 in this problem) this total phase difference must be 2$\pi$, since this is the case where your chain of phasors wraps around a circle once back to the origin to give a vector sum of zero.  At sin($\theta$) = 0.1 therefore the total phase difference will be half as much, and the phasors will wrap half way around a circle.  At sin($\theta$) = 0.3 the total phase difference would be 3$\pi$, corresponding to a wrapping around 1.5 circles.

   That is a great way to think about it &amp; helps a lot - thank you!

    So the key word here is infinitesimal? So if we had a known N or something we would have straight lines because we would have a finite amount and would be doing adjacent addition?

     That really helps, thank you!

     One other question, why is the circle going clockwise vs counter clockwise?

      You will get the same answer either way, but it is conventional to start the phasor diagram at 0 degrees (pointing along the real axis) in which case the addition of phasors whose complex phases are increasing will bend the sum of phasors in a counter clockwise direction.

   When there are N point sources the phasor diagram will have N unit vectors ("phasors") in the complex plane. Their sum is rendered by drawing the N vectors end-to-end, forming a regular N-gon or N-sided star, etc. when the sum is zero (zero intensity). Diffraction from a
   <i>
    slit
   </i>
   can be modeled as the limit of infinitely many point sources (all points along the slit), and the corresponding phasor drawing will have infinitely many infinitesimal phasors. That's how you should interpret the smooth curves (winding around a circle) above: infinitely many tiny phasors arranged end-to-end.

    I understand how to draw the phasor diagram once we have phi. How do we find phi in this case? I'm just a little confused on where to even start.
