 When you linearly polarize a circularly polarized light, is the intensity of the transmitted wave the same as the intensity of the incident wave? I think that's what happens, but I just wanted to make sure

  It depends how you perform the linear polarization process.  If you set things up in a manner that you can use a quarter-wave plate to convert circularly-polarized light to linear there will be no change in intensity, but if you simply put circularly polarized light through a linear polarizer, the intensity will be cut in half.  To understand the details of the latter process, please see my response yesterday to "Lecture 12 Q
