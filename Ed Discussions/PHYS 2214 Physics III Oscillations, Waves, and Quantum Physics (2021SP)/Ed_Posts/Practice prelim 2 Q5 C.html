 I understand that total internal reflection can occur when n1 &gt; n2, but I'm not sure how the angle of 30Â° given in the solutions was computed. Can someone post an in depth explanation of how this was solved?

  I got 30 degrees because I had sin(theta)=1/2. I got this starting with n1sin(theta1)=n2sin(theta2), and then in part c, we swap which material is incident and what not, so the light was going from n1=2 to n2=1, and the theta2 would have to at least be 90 degrees, so sin(theta2)=1, so then I had 2sin(theta1)=1
