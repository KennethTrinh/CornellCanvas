  I understand that the phases need to match, but then why is it also okay for the wavefronts to be pi out of phase?

  The sum of the incident and reflected wave at the interface must be equal to the transmitted wave at the interface, so in this sense you are correct that there cannot be a pi phase difference for the total wave across the boundary.  However, it is possible for the incident and reflected waves to be pi out of phase at the boundary, and for their sum to nevertheless still be in phase with the transmitted wave.  We have seen examples of this happening, for example for an electromagnetic wave that is incident from a high-velocity medium to a low-velocity medium the reflected wave is inverted at the interface (so it has a pi phase difference) relative to the incident wave).
