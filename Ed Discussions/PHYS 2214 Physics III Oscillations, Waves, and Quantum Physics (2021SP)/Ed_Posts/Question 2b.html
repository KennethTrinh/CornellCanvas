 I'm having a lot of trouble with this question and was wondering if anyone has some hints? Currently, I'm trying to find T as a function of its wavelength from part (a) and then setting that equal to (n^(2/3)h^2)/(3mkb) to see if I can find a relationship with the wavelength, but that quickly got messy

  To points might help.  You can use the expression for the average kinetic energy from part (a).  For the average separation of 2 atoms, if you have a density $n$ for atoms per unit volume, the average volume per atom is just $1/n$.  If two neighboring atoms are in the middle of little neighboring cubes of volume $1/n$, what is their separation?

  <math>
   T_c=\frac{n^{\frac{2}{3}}h^2}{3mk_b}
  </math>

   For what I did, I started with the same equation (as above) as you and used knowledge from chemistry about the relationship between Kinetic Energy of Molecules (have to do some re-arranging of variables and numbers). I don't know exactly how much I am allowed to say but that should help you get to a spot where you should be able to relate it to equations we have learned in the course and hopefully get something which looks very clean in the end.  Unit 20 helped me while I was doing this problem.
