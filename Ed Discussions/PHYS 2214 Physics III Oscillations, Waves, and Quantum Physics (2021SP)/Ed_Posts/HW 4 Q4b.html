 I'm trying to express the ratio of velocities in terms of the impedances of the two media. Since Z = ρv, I get:
</p>
<math>
 \frac{v_2}{v_1}=\frac{Z_2ρ_1}{Z_1ρ_2}
</math>
<p>
 However, this gives me the wrong answer when I use it in part 4e. Instead, if I let the ratio of velocities equal the ratio of impedances (shown below), I end up getting the right answer. I don't understand why.
</p>
<math>
 \frac{v_2}{v_1}=\frac{Z_2}{Z_1}
</math>

  Based just on this information, it is hard to diagnose what you are doing.  What is the expression for the transmission coefficient $T$ that you are evaluating in part 4e?  One thing you should note is that your answer for $T$ should not be the same as what is listed in Table 8-1 in the Course Notes.  In that table, the coefficients $R$ and $T$ given describe the relative amplitudes of the reflected and transmitted pressure amplitudes, which will be different than the relative amplitudes of the reflected and transmitted displacement amplitudes that you are considering in this problem.

   Thank you for your response Prof. Ralph. It turns out I forgot to use the specific values of B (i.e. B_1 and B_2) for each fluid and instead canceled B out of all of the expressions.
