 Why is the 1E-6 with the y vector? I thought it would be with the x vector, and that the y vector would have 3E-6

  The magnetic field vector must be perpendicular to the electric field vector (and also to the direction of wave propagation).  There are different ways to get to the answer, but since the wave propagation is in the z direction, one way is to compute $\vec{B} = \hat{z} \times \vec{E}/|v|$.
