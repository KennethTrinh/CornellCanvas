 I don't have a ruler in order to do question 3 on the homework accurately. What should I do?

  I used graph paper with a known square width then just eyeballed it based on them to keep it relatively proportional.

   I am in no authority to answer here, but I would guess that you can sort of estimate. I am thinking it's more important that everything is proportional. Being that submissions are online, I am not too sure that they're gonna dock points if it's not a cm on their screen. A professor or TA should correct me if I am wrong here.
