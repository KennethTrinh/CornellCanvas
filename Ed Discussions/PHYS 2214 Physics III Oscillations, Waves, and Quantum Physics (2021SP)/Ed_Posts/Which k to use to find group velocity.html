  When we have a superposition of two or more waves, how do we know which k from which wave to use for calculating the phase and group velocities?

  We have considered cases where we form a superposition from two or more waves with closely-spaced values of the wave number k.  In this case, as long as the $\omega(k)$ is a smooth function of $k$ it doesn't much matter which value of $k$ you choose from within that closely-spaced bunch -- you will get pretty much the same value of the group velocity in any case.  So taking the average value of $k$ is certainly reasonable.

 <paragraph>
  If you form a wavepacket using wave numbers that are not closely spaced and you also have a dispersion curve for which there is strong dispersion (so that the phase velocity varies a lot between the different values of $k$), then the wavepacket will not even approximately maintain its shape as it moves as a function of time.  In this case the group velocity begins to lose its usefulness as a concept, because a wavepacket that distorts strongly as a function of time doesn't really have one reasonably-defined velocity any more.
