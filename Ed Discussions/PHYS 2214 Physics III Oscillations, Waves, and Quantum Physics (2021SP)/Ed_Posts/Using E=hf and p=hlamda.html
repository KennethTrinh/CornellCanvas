 I'm still a little confused when exactly we can't and can use these. If I'm trying to calculate speed of electrons, could I use p=mv=h/lamda, or does it not apply?
</p>
<p>
 Are these equations exclusively for photons?

  These equations are OK for electrons.  For photons, it is true that $p = h/\lambda$, but not $p = mv$, because the mass of a photon is zero but it can still have nonzero momentum.

  The equation that does

   not

  hold for electrons is $v = \omega/k$, because particles move at the group velocity, not the phase velocity.
