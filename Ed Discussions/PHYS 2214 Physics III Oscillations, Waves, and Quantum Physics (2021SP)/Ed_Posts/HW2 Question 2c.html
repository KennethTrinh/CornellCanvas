 For this one would I need to find the first derivative (dy/dt) and (dy/dx) and see how it satisifies the pulse equation (dy/dt = v(dy/dx)) to find v or is there an easier way. And since the wave speed is constant can we just sub in x = 0 to make the math easier.

  To find the wave speed v, I found it easiest to simply express y(u) as a function of (x +/- vt), since we know that for any ideal transverse traveling wave, the displacement must be a function of this factor. Since we already have u in terms of x and t, simply rearrange it to fit that form and you should have a nice expression for wave speed.

   Another way to say this is that we have a function which depends on $x$ and $t$ only through a combination of the form $k x + \omega t$ where $k$ and $\omega$ are constants.  In this situation you can always conclude that the wave velocity is $v = \omega/k$.
