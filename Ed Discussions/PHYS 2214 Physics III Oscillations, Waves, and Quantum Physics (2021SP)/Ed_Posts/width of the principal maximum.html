  For HW7 Q2d, I'm confused with the concept of the width of the interference.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I thought width is sin(theta) or 2(Lamda / dN), but the answer is the angular difference (theta).

 <paragraph>
  Could you explain more about this problem?

  The angular position of the first zero next to the principal maximum at $\theta = 0$ would occur at an angle $\theta_{min}$ determined by the formula $d sin(\theta_{min}) = 1 \lambda/8$, where $N = 8$ is the number of sources.  From this you could solve for $\theta_{min}$ and then the full width of the principal maximum would be 2 $\theta_{min}$.  The answer given in the solution is approximately equal to this when $N$ is large enough that the angle $\theta_{min}$ is small, but strictly speaking I think it is more correct to solve for 2$\theta_{min}$ rather than $\Delta \theta$.
