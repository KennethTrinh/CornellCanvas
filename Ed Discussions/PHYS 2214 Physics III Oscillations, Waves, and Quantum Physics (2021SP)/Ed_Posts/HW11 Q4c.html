 Could I have some help approaching this problem? I have the wave function= e^(-x^2/2o^2) and that probability would be integral from the x in part b to infinity for the wave function squared, but I'm really confused how this is suppose to get me a number in the end? We don't have the m or k values

  The "x in part b" (written in terms of m and k) can also be expressed in terms of the "sigma" that appears in the wave function.  See Course Notes equation 24-17 on page 24-5.
