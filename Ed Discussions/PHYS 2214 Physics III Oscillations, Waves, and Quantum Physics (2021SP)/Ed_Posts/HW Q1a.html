 In question 1a, i'm confused on how to find the T_D for the integral/ the period for one cycle. Is this just 1/frequency or is it a different value for the period of driven oscillations?

  In driven oscillations, the driver and oscillator always have the same frequency (in steady state).  That frequency is determined solely by the driver.
