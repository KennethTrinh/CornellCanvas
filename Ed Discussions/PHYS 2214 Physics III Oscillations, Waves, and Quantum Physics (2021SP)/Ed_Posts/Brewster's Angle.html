 Can someone explain what Brewster's Angle represents? I'm having trouble understanding it just from reading the course notes.

  Brewster's angle is the angle of incidence for which the reflection coefficient goes to zero for incident light with the polarization component for which the incident magnetic field is parallel to the interface.  The other polarization component does nothing special at Brewster's angle.

   Can you elaborate on how this differs from the critical angle?

    The critical angle is the angle at which you first get total internal reflection when light is incident from a material with a larger index of refraction to one with a smaller index of refraction.  You can determine the critical angle simply using Snell's law as $sin(\theta_c) = n_2/n_1$.  This is a different concept from Brewster's angle -- at Brewster's angle there is no
    <i>
     reflection
    </i>
    for one polarization of incident light, whereas for the critical angle there is no
    <i>
     transmission
    </i>
    of light no matter what polarization.
