  In the lecture 12 notes, the slide about quarter wave plates says that the o component picks up an extra +/- pi/2 phase shift relative to e. Just to make sure, but if no&gt;ne, then does that mean that the velocity along the o axis is slower than the velocity along the e axis, and so there's a -pi/2 phase shift for the o component? Sometimes I get mixed up with when to add/subtract the phase shift because for L 12-11, I thought that if phi(o) &gt;phi(e), then that meant that phi(o) had a +pi/2 phase shift for the quarter wave plate, and so no&lt;ne, but the lecture notes say that no&gt;ne.

  I think the confusing point here has to do with how one understands the sign of the phase difference.  We've defined $\Delta \phi_{oe} = (k_o - k_e)d = (n_0 - n_e)(\omega/c)d$.  This means that when both components of the wave have traveled the same distance $d$, if the polarization along the o axis has the larger value of $k$ (meaning slower velocity) then our $\Delta \phi_{oe}$ is positive.  But this means that it takes longer for the component with polarization along the o axis to reach the far side of the plate, so this component is trailing the other component by this amount of phase.  A positive value of the phase difference does not mean that the component in question is leading the other component as a function of time -- it actually means the opposite.

  The way that I remember all this is that the component of the wave with the larger index of refraction is delayed in time.
