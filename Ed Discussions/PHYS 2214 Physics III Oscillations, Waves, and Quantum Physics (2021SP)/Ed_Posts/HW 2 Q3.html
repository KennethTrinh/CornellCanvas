 Hi. I’m not 100% sure how to get the direction of travel of the pulse in this question. I’m using the pulse equation to get the pulse speed, but I’m not sure how I can use the graph to determine the direction of travel. Do I even need the graph for this or does the sign of v determine the direction of travel?
</p>

  The graph alone, showing displacement of the medium at an instant in time, is by itself insufficient to determine the direction of wave propagation.  However, the graph along with the specified information about what the piece of string at 6 m is doing at that instant in time, allows determination of the direction of travel.
