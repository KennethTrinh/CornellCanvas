 Once one of the fans makes an upward sweep, do they do a downward sweep or do they simply leave it up there. Additionally, what is the direction of the downward sweep is it: Downward one (in the oother way of the upward motion, or in the same way the hands were brought up. Im pretty sure its downward version 1 since thats a more common wave sequence but the question is somewhat confusing and unclear as to how the motions are done and in what way they are going.

  Each fan follows the motion of their -x neighbor in both the upward and downward sweeps.  I don't believe the solution depends on which way you visualize the problem (either Downward 1 or Downward 2) as long as $\theta$ goes up during the upward sweeps and down during the downward sweeps.  However, typically the wave is done with arms tilted upward and downward in the forward direction, rather than to the side, so your picture of Downward 2 is the more physically accurate.

   "Downward 2" is the right interpretation. The arm angle is always between 0 and 90, and your "downward 1" looks like the arms end up at angle 180 (very uncomfortable).
