  In this question, n=3 can be valid for the antisymmetric and symmetric boundary condition so How were we able to make the assumption that we were dealing with a a symmetric boundary condition instead of the antisymmetric case?

  Generally, standing waves on strings need to have two fixed ends, and therefore symmetric boundary conditions.  When we talked about reflection from the end of a string, we did imagine that it might be possible to rig up a free boundary condition with something  like a frictionless ring on a pole that can move up and down while maintaining tension in the string, but this is not really something that is possible to implement in practice.
