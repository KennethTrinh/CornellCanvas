  I am having a hard time figuring out how to find the values of R and T. Is it the ratio of the areas of each side?

  The areas under the curves are the important items to consider.  Think normalization.  The electron exists exactly once, with different probability depending upon location.  The total area under the curves thus represents 100% of the probability.  The probability for transmission is the ratio of the forward-moving distribution's area to the total area of both curves.  For the probability for reflection, compare the backward-moving distribution's area to the total area of both curves.  Naturally, you should find R+T=1.
