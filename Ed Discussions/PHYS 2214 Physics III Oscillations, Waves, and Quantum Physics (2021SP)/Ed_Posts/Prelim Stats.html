  I expect that the grading will be finished during the day on Monday, and I will send an announcement when we are done.  I plan to discuss the overall results and their meaning during Tuesday's lectures.   In the mean time, Canvas does not appear to be reliable in keeping the scores for partially-graded tests hidden before they are released.  As we grade, only the points for the graded problems register, so you may see some apparently-low partial scores during the grading process if the hidden-grade feature malfunctions.

  So please relax and think about other things until I let you know that the grading is finished.
