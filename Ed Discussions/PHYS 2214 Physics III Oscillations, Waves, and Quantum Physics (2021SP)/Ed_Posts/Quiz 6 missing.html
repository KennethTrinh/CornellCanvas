 It seems like the assignment is up, however it lists "No Content" instead of a download button like there usually is.

   Quiz is posted and active.  I suggest restarting browser, computer, whatever it takes, to access the content.

    The quiz is posted and available but no pdf has been attached.... unless both of our computers are faulty
