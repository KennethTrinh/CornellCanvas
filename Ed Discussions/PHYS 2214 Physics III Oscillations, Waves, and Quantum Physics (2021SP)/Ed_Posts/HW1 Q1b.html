  I'm stuck on how to calculate omega using quantities given by the graph. I know the net force acting on an object at stable equilibrium is 0, and, from reading the position axis, that the stable equilibrium point is at x = -1.5m. As a result, I though I could use the formula:
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  \text{F}_{net}\left(x_{eq}\right)=-m\omega^2x_{eq}
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  However, it falls apart due to the net force being zero. Am I missing something here?

  "... if the grapefruit is displaced a small amount and released" is the key phrase here.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Essentially, if you imagine that this grapefruit is in between two hills and you displace it from equilibrium a little bit such that it is up one of the hills. Assuming no friction, this grapefruit will "oscillate" by rolling down the hill, past the equilibrium point, and up the other hill. When it is up one of the hills (i.e. the initial displacement), there is a net force and a displacement from equilibrium.

  The formula you listed says that near a stable equilibrium point the force is equal to a negative constant times the displacement from the equilibrium position.  I think the key point that you may be missing is that the negative constant corresponds to the slope

 <math>
  \frac{dF}{dx}

  evaluated at the equilibrium point, not the value of the force at the equilibrium point.

  I am attempting to use
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  \omega=\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  but I am unsure of what k represnts in this case since this is not a spring problem so it can't be the spring constant. My best guess is that it would be the slope of the force at the equilibrium point because I rearranged F = -kx to get -F/x = k and the grapefruit is displaced a small amount. But again I am confused because k is the spring constant.

  It can be thought of as a spring problem though since it is an oscillator, with $k$ as the effective spring constant, even though there is not literally a spring. You are on the right track with rearranging to get F/x=-k, but from Prof. Ralph's comment, you should use the slope instead of just F/x.

  I think I understand now. The slope is simply the constant from
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  ^{-m\omega^2}
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  Using that it should be pretty easy to solve for omega. Also, there is no need for the equation ω=sqrt(m/k) ​since there is no spring or spring constant.

  You are right until the last sentence. Setting $m\omega^2$ equal to the slope is using $m\omega^2=k$. The spring constant is an effective spring constant; there isn't literally a spring in the problem, but because it is a simple oscillator, we can say that it behaves as if there were one.

  I still do not understand. If you set the right side of the given equation equal to that derivative times the displacement and grind out the calculus, you would still end up with the same equation and have the right side equation set equal to 0. Am I missing something?
