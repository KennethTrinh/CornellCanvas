 I was watching the alternate reading videos through Panopto (thank you for providing that!) when panopto stopped working. I have been unable to actually see any new videos when I click on the provided links. To be clear, they were working fine, and now I cannot open any of them. I have tried changing networks and such. Not sure if the problem is on my end or Panopto, but I thought I would ask if anyone knew any solutions anyway.

 Thanks!

  The videos, accessed via our course Canvas page, play fine when I try them.  Perhaps contacting it.cornell.edu would be helpful.
