  The period of the signal is 1 second, so the frequencies that are possible in the Fourier series are $f_n = n/(1 s)$.  You should be able to recognize that the periodic signal shown represents a beat pattern, like the one in Figures 6.4 and 6.5 of the Course Notes.  A beat pattern is formed from the superposition of two sinusoidal waves of the same amplitude and slightly different frequencies, $f_a$ and $f_b$.  The frequency of the beats (1/(time between the maxima in the beat pattern)) is is $f_b - f_a$.  For the example shown this gives $f_b - f_a = 1/(1 s)$.  The frequency of the fast oscillation within the envelope function of the beats is $(f_b + f_a)/2$.  For the example shown this gives $(f_b + f_a)/2 = 9.5/(1 s)$ (corresponding to a period slightly more than 0.1 s).  From these two equations you can solve for $f_a$ and $f_b$.
