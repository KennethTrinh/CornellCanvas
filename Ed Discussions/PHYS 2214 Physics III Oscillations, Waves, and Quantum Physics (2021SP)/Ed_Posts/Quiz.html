  Yes, the quiz opens with the following paragraph,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  "The main purpose of the quizzes is to help both you and your teachers to assess how well you have mastered the material covered in the homework and coops. Please take this quiz after completing the homework and coops, and take it by yourself, without discussing it with anyone else. It is open-book, open-notes. There is no time limit for this quiz, but on the prelims and the final you would be expected to answer a group of questions of this sort within about 10-15 minutes. Each quiz will also have a “For your consideration” question that is not graded and features a real-world application."
