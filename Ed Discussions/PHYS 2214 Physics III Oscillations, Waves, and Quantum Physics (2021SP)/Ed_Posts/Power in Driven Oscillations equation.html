 In the lecture slides the equation for average power delivered by the drive force is written as (1/2)F_0v_0cos(phi_v) but in the pre-lecture videos associated with the readings, the equation omits the 1/2 from the equation, and I could not find the equation at all in the lecture notes. Could someone clarify which one is the right one?

  Good catch.  The correct answer is the one that includes the factor of 1/2.  You can check this by considering the case where the force and the velocity are in-phase, so that the power averaged over one period is
 </p>
 <math>
  P_{av}=\frac{1}{T_D}\int_0^{T_D}F_0\cos\left(\omega t\right)v_0\cos\left(\omega t\right)dt=\frac{1}{2}F_0v_0
 </math>

  because the average value of (cosine squared) is 1/2.
