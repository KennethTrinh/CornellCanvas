  I think N is the number of sources and little n is simply an integer (i.e. ... -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...)

  I know that little n in other contexts usually refers to the "n-th" maxima. This is the same n here, however, I am also having a little difficulty imagining the physical interpretation of little n in this context.

  My best guess is that resolvance changes with regards to which maxima you're looking at, and resolvance becomes greater when you reach maxima farther and farther from theta = 0 (i.e. the absolute value of n becomes greater and greater). This might be because maxima far away from the central one are easier to resolve.

  I could be entirely wrong though :)

  The lower case 'n' refers to the 'order' in the diffraction pattern.  First order refers to the maximum closest to the central maximum.  Second order refers to the maximum at the next larger angle away from the central maximum, and so on.  Resolvance is improved in higher orders for which the angular separation of maxima always increases.
