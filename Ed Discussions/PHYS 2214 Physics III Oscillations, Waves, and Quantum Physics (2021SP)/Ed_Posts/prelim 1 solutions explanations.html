 Are there explanations for prelim solutions? I am a bit confused on how the answer was found for questions 4, 6, 7, and 8.

  The correct answers are listed within the Module "Prelim 1 Solutions" (currently the next-to-last module on the Modules page), but there is not much explanation given there.  For more detailed explanations, I suggest dropping by one of the office hours today (1-7 pm) or tomorrow (1-5 pm) and talking with one of the teaching staff.  Links to the Zoom sessions for the office hours are at the top of the Canvas home page and under the Zoom tab.
