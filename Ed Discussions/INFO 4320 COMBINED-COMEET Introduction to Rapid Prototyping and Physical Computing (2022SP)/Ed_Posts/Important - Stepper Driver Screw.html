 As mentioned in class, turning the little screw on your stepper motor driver (purple board) will affect the amount of current flowing through the motor. Even if your motor is running well, the current setting may still be too high, causing your motor to overheat.

  If your motor becomes hot to the touch (warm is fine), unplug the 9v power supply immediately!
 </b>
 A good common practice whenever setting up a stepper motor is to turn the driver screw GENTLY and slowly, until the motor stops spinning. Then slowly turn the screw in the other direction until the motor is spinning smoothly. You can turn up the current a little bit past the point the motor starts spinning, but not too much.
