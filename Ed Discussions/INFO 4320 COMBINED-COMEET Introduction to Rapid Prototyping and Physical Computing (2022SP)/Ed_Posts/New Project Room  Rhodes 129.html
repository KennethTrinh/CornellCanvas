 To address the need for project space in the final week, we are allowed to use Rhodes 129 (across the student space) until the end of the semester. Rhodes 129 has a huge space that can allow many teams to work on the same project.
</p>
<p>
 All of you should have already received access to Rhodes 129. If not, please let us know. The space is first come first serve:
</p>
<p>
 Here is how we plan to use the rooms:
</p>
<p>
 <b>

 Only use this room when you need to do 3D printing and laser cutting.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Rhodes 129:
 </b>
 where your project team can work together and also store your team project hardware.
</p>
<p>
