 I noticed while performing the Logic Analyzer sampling for our magnetometer project that my MISO transfer reading is significantly shorter compared to the readings provided in the lecture slides.

 My analysis:

 Should our SPI MISO transfer readings be as long as the ones seen in lecture? If so, how do we get our SPI MISO transfer readings to match the format seen in the lecture?

  I think your screenshot on SPI communication is accurate.

  Your recording does not have to be the same as the slides.
