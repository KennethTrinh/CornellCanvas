 Hi! I was wondering whether some additional explanation could be made for what exactly you mean by 'An analysis of discrepancies between the two and what should be done to address them;'? I am a little confused about what is asked to be described in this part of the presentation. To which 'two' does it relate? Thanks for the help!
</p>

  The two are "your original design " and "your actual implementation " of the functional blocks.  If your implementation is not exactly the same as your design, please explain why and how do you plan to address the differences to achieve your design.
