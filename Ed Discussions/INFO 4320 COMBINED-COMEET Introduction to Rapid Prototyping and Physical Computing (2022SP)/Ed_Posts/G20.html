  If we are using G20 as the demo space, are we allowed to keep our team projects in there until the demo date? Or do we still need to clear it out completely before Thursday? What is the procedure on Thursday like? Should we bring our projects back on Thursday morning before the demo time?

  Based on what I know, we can keep G20 to demo projects in our class.  I was told that we need to clean G20 for the demo setting.
