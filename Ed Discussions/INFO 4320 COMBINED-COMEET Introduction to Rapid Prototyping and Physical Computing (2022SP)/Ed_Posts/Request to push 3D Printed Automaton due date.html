  With the final demo session being so close to the 3D Printed Automaton project deadline, it is very difficult to complete everything on time. On top of this pressure, the broken printers have made it even more difficult, especially because this is many of our first times 3d printing.

  Would it be possible to push the 3D Printed Automaton due date to allow us more time to complete both this project and the final project to the best of our abilities?
