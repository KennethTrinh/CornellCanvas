  Hi Everyone,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  We will use tomorrow's class as a workshop session, where we can help you with your projects.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If you have not finished your mini-project this week, feel free to continue working on it. Our goal is to help you to finish the mini-projects as much as possible in the class so that you can spend more time on design project 3 and team projects after class.
