 In the description of the mini-project, the slides showed using the light intensity, as described below:
</p>
<p>
 "–absolute (Current light intensity – target light intensity ) &lt; = 50"
</p>
<p>
 This was an error. We do not measure light intensity in this assignment.  You should use the "distance " set by the potentiometer and measured by the range sensor in this assignment.
</p>
<p>
 Sorry for the inconvenience. I have updated the slides on canvas.

   You can do it by millimeters or cm. Either way it should be fine.
