 <paragraph>
  tomorrow each team will present their cardboard prototypes. Please come

   5 minutes early

  to class to set up your cardboard prototype, since time is limited. Each team will have
  <bold>
   6 minutes
  </bold>
  total to present (4 minutes presenting, and 2 minutes Q&amp;A). Teams will be divided into 2 groups (see table below). If your team is in group 1, set up your prototype on a table in the

   first half of the classroom

  <bold>
   far side of the classroom
  </bold>
  , farthest from the door. Here is the table assigning teams to group numbers:
