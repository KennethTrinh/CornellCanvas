 Hi everyone,
</p>
<p>
 tomorrow each team will present their cardboard prototypes. Please come
 <b>
  5 minutes early
 </b>
 to class to set up your cardboard prototype, since time is limited. Each team will have
 <b>
  6 minutes
 </b>
 total to present (4 minutes presenting, and 2 minutes Q&amp;A). Teams will be divided into 2 groups (see table below). If your team is in group 1, set up your prototype on a table in the
 <b>
  first half of the classroom
 </b>
 , closest to the door. If your team is in group 2, set up your prototype on a table on the
 <b>
  far side of the classroom
 </b>
 , farthest from the door. Here is the table assigning teams to group numbers:
