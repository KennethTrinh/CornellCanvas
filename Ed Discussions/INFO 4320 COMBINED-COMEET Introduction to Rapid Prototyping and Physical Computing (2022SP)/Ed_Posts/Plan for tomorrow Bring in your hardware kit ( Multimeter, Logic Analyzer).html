  Hi Everyone,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Follow-up from the last msg: I just realized that we have not distributed the Lego Kit. We
  <bold>
   will not
  </bold>
  work on Lego Kit tomorrow. I am sorry for the confusion.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The updated plan  for tomorrow is :
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1. Continue working on this week's mini-project.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. Help every student to practice using the
  <bold>
   digital multimeter
  </bold>
  and
  <bold>
   Logic Analyzer
  </bold>
  .
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Please make sure you bring the above hardware to the classroom tomorrow.
