 Hi Everyone,
</p>
<p>
 Follow-up from the last msg: I just realized that we have not distributed the Lego Kit. We
 <b>
  will not
 </b>
 work on Lego Kit tomorrow. I am sorry for the confusion.
</p>
<p>
 The updated plan  for tomorrow is :
</p>
<p>
 1. Continue working on this week's mini-project.
</p>
<p>
 2. Help every student to practice using the
 <b>
  digital multimeter
 </b>
 and
 <b>
  Logic Analyzer
 </b>
 .
</p>
<p>
 Please make sure you bring the above hardware to the classroom tomorrow.
</p>
