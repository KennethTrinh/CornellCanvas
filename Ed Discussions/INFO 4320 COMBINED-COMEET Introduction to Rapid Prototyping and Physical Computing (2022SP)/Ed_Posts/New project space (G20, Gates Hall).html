  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  We can use G20 at Gates as the project space from tomorrow (Apr 28).  The department has set up tables and chairs in G20.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The plan to use G20 and Rhodes 114 are:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1. G20: You can put your hardware box in G20 and do group projects and discussions in G20.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. Rhodes 114: try to use Rhodes 114, only when you need to do 3D printing and laser cutting.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  3. Rhodes 100: We should move our stuff out from Rhodes 100 and
  <bold>
   stop using it.
  </bold>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The lab clean mini-project can also apply to G20.
