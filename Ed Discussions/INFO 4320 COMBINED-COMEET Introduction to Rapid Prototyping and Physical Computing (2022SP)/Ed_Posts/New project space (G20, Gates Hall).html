 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 We can use G20 at Gates as the project space from tomorrow (Apr 28).  The department has set up tables and chairs in G20.
</p>
<p>
 The plan to use G20 and Rhodes 114 are:
</p>
<p>
 1. G20: You can put your hardware box in G20 and do group projects and discussions in G20.
</p>
<p>
 2. Rhodes 114: try to use Rhodes 114, only when you need to do 3D printing and laser cutting.
</p>
<p>
 3. Rhodes 100: We should move our stuff out from Rhodes 100 and
 <b>
  stop using it.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 The lab clean mini-project can also apply to G20.
</p>
