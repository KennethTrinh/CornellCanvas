  How am I able to submit both the link and the code file under one submission type? I could not drag the code file to the text box.

  You can add the video link as a comment and the file under file upload. Or simply include a text file with the link to your video.

  Oops, I literally just saw this thread. Is it okay that I just commented my code under the fan control assignment now? I was originally wondering the same thing but just assumed uploading the video link by itself would suffice since it would only allow for one submission type.
