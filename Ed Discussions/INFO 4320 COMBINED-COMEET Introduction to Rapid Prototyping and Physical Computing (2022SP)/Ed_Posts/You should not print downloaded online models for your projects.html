  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Just a reminder, as for design project 3, you are allowed to reuse others' design ideas.
  <bold>
   But you can not directly download files online and use them to 3D print for your project
  </bold>
  .  You need to design the 3D model by yourself using CAD software, print them out and assemble them together.

  Ideally yes.  having multiple parts identical may impact the creativity and complexity of the project.
