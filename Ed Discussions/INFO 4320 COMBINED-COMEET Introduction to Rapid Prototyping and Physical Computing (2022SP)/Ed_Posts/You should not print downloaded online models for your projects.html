 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 Just a reminder, as for design project 3, you are allowed to reuse others' design ideas.
 <b>
  But you can not directly download files online and use them to 3D print for your project
 </b>
 .  You need to design the 3D model by yourself using CAD software, print them out and assemble them together.

  Is this with the exception of gears that do not count as one of the six pieces?

   Do the six parts have to be different from each other?

    Ideally yes.  having multiple parts identical may impact the creativity and complexity of the project.

    yes. If the gears are just a small part of the project, and do not count as one of the six pieces .
