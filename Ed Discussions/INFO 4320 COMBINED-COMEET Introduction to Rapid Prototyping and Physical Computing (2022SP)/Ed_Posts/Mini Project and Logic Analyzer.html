 In terms of submission for this week's mini project, do we submit the youtube video, code, and the screenshot of our logic analyzer or just the screenshot?
</p>
<p>
 Also, I have asked in class already about the Windows issue with the logic analyzer and was told to re-install the app and try to run it a couple of times. I have also tried instructions that I found on one of the Ed posts. I was unsuccessful in getting the logic analyzer up and running, and I heard that there are several students who experienced the same issues on Windows. Is there any solution for this? Thanks
</p>

  Screenshot for the logic analyzer (pulse view).
 </p>
 <p>
  Can you come to the OH so that we can take a closer look at this issue?
 </p>
 <p>
  I only saw one student having this issue.  If there are more students have these issues on windows, please let me know. It can be the version of the pulse view that is not compatible with certain version of windows system.

   Following up on this, do we need to submit any video or picture of the LCD screen?

    As always, a demo video of the LCD screen is required.

     Is a screenshot of Pulse View sufficient or does it have to be a screen recording?

      Screen shot of pulse view is enough.
