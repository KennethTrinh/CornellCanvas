  For the first prototype parts list, should it be in the same format as last time (excel sheet) or would a written list on an extra slide suffice?

  According to Canvas, you do not need to show the parts list in the presentation (but you can if you think it explains some other parts of your presentation). You should include an excel sheet like last time in the submission, with all parts you need ordered to complete the prototype.
