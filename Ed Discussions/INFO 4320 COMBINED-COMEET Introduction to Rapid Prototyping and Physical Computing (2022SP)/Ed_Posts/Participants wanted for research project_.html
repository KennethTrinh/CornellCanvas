 Hi all, I'm looking for volunteer participants for a research project in our lab led by my labmate Ke Li. You won't get credit for this course for participating, but the project is very interesting and also hardware-related. We would really appreciate it if you are interested and could participate in the study. Just let
 <b>
  Ke (kl975@cornell.edu)
 </b>
 or
 <b>
  me (rz379@cornell.edu)
 </b>
 know!
</p>

 Recruitment info:
</p>
<p>
 <i>
  Our SciFi Lab group are currently recruiting study volunteers for our current project. In this project, we aim to explore using wearable speakers and microphones around ears to recognize facial expressions (e.g., positions and shapes of mouth, eyes, and eyebrows).
 </i>
</p>
<p>
 <i>
  The experiments will ask participants to wear an ear-mounted device, like an earphone and perform a given set of facial expressions multiple times following a video instruction while sitting and/or walking. The estimated time for the user study will be
  <b>
   around 1.5 hours
  </b>
  each time you come (maybe you will be required to come twice). The compensation for each participant taking the study once would be
  <b>
   $15
  </b>
  . If you come twice, you will also be paid twice. This study will be conducted at
  <b>
   Gates Hall
  </b>
  .

 <i>
  We will strictly follow the instructions published by Cornell University and local health administrations to mitigate the viral transmission risk, including keeping contact record, minimizing human-to-human interactions, disinfecting any device and furniture used in the study.

  If you or someone you know are interested in participating in the user study, please let the IS PhD student who leads the project,
  <b>
   Ke (
   <a href="null">
    kl975@cornell.edu
    )
   </a>
  </b>
  know via email. It would be best if you can participate in the study during
  <b>
   this week or next week
  </b>
  .
