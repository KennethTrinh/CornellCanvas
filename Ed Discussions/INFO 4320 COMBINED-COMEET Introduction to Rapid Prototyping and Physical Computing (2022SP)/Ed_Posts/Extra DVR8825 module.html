 My current DVR8825 module is running incredibly hot regardless of how I set the trim potentiometer. Are there any extras in the lab that I could use to replace the one I am currently using? Also, my circuit ran fine for a while before the module began running extremely hot. Thanks.

  This can apply to any driver module. using the potentiometer to use the minimal current to drive it can help. but if the motor continues running for an extended period of time, this can still happen to other drivers too.

  We may have a few extra ones left. Pls, talk to your TA about this.
