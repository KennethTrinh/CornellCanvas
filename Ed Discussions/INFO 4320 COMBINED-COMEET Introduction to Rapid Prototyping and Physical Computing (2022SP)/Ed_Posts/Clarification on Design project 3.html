  I got a question on whether you can import and use online gear design in your 3D design project.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The answer is yes. You can use and import the online design of gear in your project.
  <bold>
   However, the imported item will not count as one of the 6 parts which are required for this project.
  </bold>
  In other words, besides the imported gears, you need another 6 parts of your design to satisfy this requirement.

 <paragraph>
  Please let me know if you have any further questions.
