 I got a question on whether you can import and use online gear design in your 3D design project.
</p>
<p>
 The answer is yes. You can use and import the online design of gear in your project.
 <b>
  However, the imported item will not count as one of the 6 parts which are required for this project.
 </b>
 In other words, besides the imported gears, you need another 6 parts of your design to satisfy this requirement.
</p>
<p>
 Please let me know if you have any further questions.

  Are there any example projects from past semesters we could look at?
