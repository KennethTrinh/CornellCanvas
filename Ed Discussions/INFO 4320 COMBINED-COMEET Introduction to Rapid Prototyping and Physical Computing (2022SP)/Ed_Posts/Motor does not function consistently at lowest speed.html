  When I try to set the motor to a speed of 1 (i.e. analogWrite with value 1/9 * 255), the motor fails to spin 90% of the time and instead makes a high pitched noise. Every other speed setting functions as intended. I believe this may be an issue with the motor. What should I do about this?

  Did your motor work well before?  Please bring your hardware to OH tomorrow. We can help you check on that. If it is a faulty motor, we can replace one for you. If you have a classmate whom you can borrow their motor, you can also use their motor to test.

  Did you get it solved? Feel free to come to OH today to get some help. Usually, it was caused by wiring.

  It happened to me too. The weird thing is if I first set speed to 5 then back to 1, speed 1 spins fine. But if I directly set the motor to speed 1 after speed 0, most of the time it won't spin, just producing a high pitch sound.

  Do we have a solution for this now?
