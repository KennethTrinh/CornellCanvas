 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 Given you have design project 2 due tomorrow,
 <b>
  We will not teach any new content in tomorrow's class.
 </b>
 Our last mini-project will be taught next week, which will be about using LED Matrix+ KeyPad.
</p>
<p>
 In tomorrow's class, we will use it as a workshop session, in which we will:
</p>
<p>
 1. Help students who are working on individual assignments, including design projects 2 or 3.  or mini-projects.
</p>
<p>
 2. Answer any questions you may have on your team projects or the feedback we gave during Monday's presentation.
</p>
<p>
 See you in class.
</p>
