 Hi ,
</p>
<p>
 I am trying to get more project space for our class, as we clearly need more space to work on group projects in the next couple of weeks.
</p>
<p>
 As for now, In addition to Rhodes 114, we can also use Rhodes 100 with the following rules:
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  1. Do not leave any hardware in Rhodes 100.
 </b>
 When you finish working on projects, pls move the hardware back to Rhodes 114. Rhodes 100 is shared with another class.
</p>
<p>
 2. Pls only use the
 <b>
  Rectangular
 </b>
 and
 <b>
  Round shape
 </b>
 tables in the room.  The other tables are occupied by students in another class.
</p>
<p>
 3. Do not touch other tables' materials, which belong to another class.
</p>
<p>
 I will hear back from the department next week on what other rooms we can use for our class. Pls stay tuned.
</p>
