  Hi ,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I am trying to get more project space for our class, as we clearly need more space to work on group projects in the next couple of weeks.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  As for now, In addition to Rhodes 114, we can also use Rhodes 100 with the following rules:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <bold>
   1. Do not leave any hardware in Rhodes 100.
  </bold>
  When you finish working on projects, pls move the hardware back to Rhodes 114. Rhodes 100 is shared with another class.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. Pls only use the
  <bold>
   Rectangular
  </bold>
  and
  <bold>
   Round shape
  </bold>
  tables in the room.  The other tables are occupied by students in another class.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  3. Do not touch other tables' materials, which belong to another class.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I will hear back from the department next week on what other rooms we can use for our class. Pls stay tuned.
