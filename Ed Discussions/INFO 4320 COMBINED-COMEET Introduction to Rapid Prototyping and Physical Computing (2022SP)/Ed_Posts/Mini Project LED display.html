 Hi, I had a question about the LED display requirements for this mini-project. I am pretty sure my code is correct and the numbers are shown correctly on the LED screen as well. However, there are issues because (I assume) some wires are touching each other due to so many of them, and then the numbers show up shaky sometimes and not 100% clear all the time. Is that correct for the video for this week's mini-project, or do they need to be perfectly displayed? Thanks
</p>

  If you believe that the issue is caused by wires touching each other, then you should try to separate them. For instance, you can use short wires, cut excessive lengths that does not have the plastic insulation, cut the legs of resistors, etc. Also, using Dupont wires may result in fewer connection issues.
