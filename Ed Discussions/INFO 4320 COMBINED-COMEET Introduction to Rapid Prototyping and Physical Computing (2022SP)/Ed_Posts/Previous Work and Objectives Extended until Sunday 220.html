  Since many teams have not yet met with their assigned TA to discuss their initial design sketches, we have decided to
  <bold>
   extend the paper submission deadline to this Sunday 2/20 at 11:59 PM
  </bold>
  . Be sure to include all items under the
  <underline>
   deliverables
  </underline>
  section of the assignment, as well as your sketches both before and after receiving feedback from your assigned TA.
