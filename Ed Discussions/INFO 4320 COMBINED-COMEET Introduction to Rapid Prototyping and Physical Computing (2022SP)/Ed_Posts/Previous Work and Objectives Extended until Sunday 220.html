 Since many teams have not yet met with their assigned TA to discuss their initial design sketches, we have decided to
 <b>
  extend the paper submission deadline to this Sunday 2/20 at 11:59 PM
 </b>
 . Be sure to include all items under the
 <underline>
  deliverables
 </underline>
 section of the assignment, as well as your sketches both before and after receiving feedback from your assigned TA.
