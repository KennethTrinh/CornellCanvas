  Hi Everyone,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  We will continue working on more hardware-related assignments in the coming week. More specifically, we will show how to read sensor readings and use the LCD screen via I2C and SPI communications.

 <paragraph>
  Please do not forget to bring in your full hardware box (except the Lego box) to the classroom tomorrow.

  See you tomorrow.
