 Hi Everyone,
</p>
<p>
 We will continue working on more hardware-related assignments in the coming week. More specifically, we will show how to read sensor readings and use the LCD screen via I2C and SPI communications.
</p>
<p>
 Please do not forget to bring in your full hardware box (except the Lego box) to the classroom tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
 See you tomorrow.
</p>
