 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 Please try to set up your demo today early (Tables will be available in G03 /05 now).  It will take time to set up the system and moving the hardware from Rhodes to Gates can also cause problems.  Moving your project to Gates early would give you time to debug any potential issues.
</p>
<p>
 Looking forward to your demos!
</p>
