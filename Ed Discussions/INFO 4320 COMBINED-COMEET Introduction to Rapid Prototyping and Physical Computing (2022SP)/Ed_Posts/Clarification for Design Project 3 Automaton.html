 The assignment description says "you have to build the model yourself from scratch" but does this only concern physically connecting components or is this saying we need to make a CAD from scratch? It also says that "The mechanical automaton could be a copy of an existing design" so does this mean that we are allowed to find an existing CAD online and print/assemble it ourselves?
</p>
<p>
 Furthermore, the deliverables include the Fusion 360 file of the model, but if we are allowed to use an existing design should we just submit the CAD file we found online?

   You can not use any online CAD files.

  You need to do your own design. If you want to copy an existing design, you need to design them from scratch on Fusion 360.
