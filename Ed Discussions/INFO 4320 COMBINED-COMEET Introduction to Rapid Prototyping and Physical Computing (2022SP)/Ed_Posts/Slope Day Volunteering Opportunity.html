  HI All, completely outside my TA role in the class, I wanted to mention that Slope Day is calling all volunteers! Volunteers are key to making the event a success, and we need your help to ensure the event is safe and fun for all! Do you want to know the best part? Slope Day volunteers can volunteer for as little as 2 hours, and in return will receive a free tshirt, slope day branded reusable water bottle, and lunch on us! If you volunteer for 4 hours, you will also receive a slope day fanny pack and be entered for a chance to win a Nintendo Switch! If you are interested in volunteering, head on over to
