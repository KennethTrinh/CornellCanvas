 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 When I try to run the Processing Sonar file it gives me this error and the system dialogue says that Java has crashed. Anyone know what's going wrong here?
</p>
<p>
 Some Stack Overflow responses have said this error might be caused by running macOS &lt; 10.12, but I'm currently running macOS Catalina 10.15.1 so I'm really lost on how to navigate this issue.

  did you install processing IDE? Was this error directly from the Processing IDE?

    This is probably a setup issue. Can you try to install an older version of Processing?
