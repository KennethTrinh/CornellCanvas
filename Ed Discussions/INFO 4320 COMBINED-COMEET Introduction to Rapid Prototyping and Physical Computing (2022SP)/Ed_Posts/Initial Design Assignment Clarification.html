  There are a lot of questions circulating on the deliverables of the Initial Design Assignment, below are some clarifications.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1. You do not need to have two cardboard prototypes. Instead, create a prototype with cardboard, and take pictures of it. Then meet with your TA and test the device on your own, documenting your testing process. Then, improve the cardboard design. This shows iteration, but does not require you to have two separate prototypes. Document this entire iterative process in your paper.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. Make sure you meet with your TA next week and present the cardboard prototype. We have two TA meetings until this is due, but only if you meet Monday or Tuesday, otherwise you only have one meeting, so use it wisely!
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  3. Your cardboard design does not need to have ANY automatic moving parts or electronics. Of course, you can implement these if you want, but it is not required (nor recommended unless it directly is useful to the initial design). Instead, show how your parts will move by moving them manually (with your hand) and show where the electronic components will be placed and how they will operate.

  4. Over the course of creating your cardboard design, you will develop your parts list as well. Don't do these portions separately, instead do them together to improve both parts.
