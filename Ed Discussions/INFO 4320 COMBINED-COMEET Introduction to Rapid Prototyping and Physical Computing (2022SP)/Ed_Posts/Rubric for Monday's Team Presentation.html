  Looking at the syllabus and the Canvas in general, I wasn't able to find a rubric for next Monday's presentation. The syllabus states that it is graded on the 0-100% scale and that this part is worth 15% of our total grade. I was just wondering since there's not writeup nor any official Canvas submission, how will this be graded? Is it mostly based on the feedback that was incorporated, progress that has been made, and overall presentation explanation/ slides? Or is there any way in which the grade/percentagess will be given for this? A bit more clarification about this on Canvas could be helpful, I believe. Thanks for the help!

  Thank you - can you make it available now (before the class so that we can work on it during the class as well)?
