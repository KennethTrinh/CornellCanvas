  HI,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Just a reminder that we will not teach new content tomorrow. Instead, we will use the 2.5 hours to work on your team projects.
  <bold>
   Therefore, you still need to attend the class.
  </bold>
  You can bring your hardware to the classroom and work from there.  TA and I will be there to support you.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Given we are 11 days from the demo day, this is a great opportunity to make progress on your projects and get feedback.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <bold>
   All of your hardware orders should have arrived. If you are still missing hardware components, you need to inform me and your TA by tomorrow's class.
