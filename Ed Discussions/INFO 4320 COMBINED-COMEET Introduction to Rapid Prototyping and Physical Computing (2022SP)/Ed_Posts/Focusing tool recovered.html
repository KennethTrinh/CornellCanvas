 The focusing tool for the laser cutter has been recovered. We would like to remind you that please be considerate and responsible while using the laser cutter and make sure to
 <b>
  put it back in the container
 </b>
 on the right immediately after focusing. Please remember that
 <b>
  the focusing tool should be removed before cutting begins
 </b>
 .
