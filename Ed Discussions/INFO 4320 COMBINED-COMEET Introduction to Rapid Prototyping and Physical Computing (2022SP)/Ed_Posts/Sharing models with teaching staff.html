 The first assignment says to share models with the teaching staff. I believe we need to invite people by entering their email, so is it possible to get a list of emails that we need to share with?

  There are easier ways to submit the assignment. You can download the files and upload them to canvas, or put them in a Google Drive folder and link it (a link in a text box when you turn in the assignment). Sharing the Fusion folder is (in my opinion) more work than the other options.

  Additionally, I believe canvas has our emails listed (in the "teaching staff and office hours" page)
