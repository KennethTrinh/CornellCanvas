 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 Please bring both your
 <b>
  hardware boxes and Lego kit
 </b>
 to the classroom together.  We need these to work on the mini-project.
</p>
<p>
 In addition, we will also distribute a wooden wheel (needed for mini project) and plywood (design project) in class.
</p>
<p>
 If you can not attend the class, pls contact your TA on picking up the materials.
</p>
