  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Please bring both your

  to the classroom together.  We need these to work on the mini-project.

  In addition, we will also distribute a wooden wheel (needed for mini project) and plywood (design project) in class.

  If you can not attend the class, pls contact your TA on picking up the materials.
