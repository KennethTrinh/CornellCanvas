  Hi Everyone,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Our demo session will be held on
  <bold>
   the ground floor at Gates hall
  </bold>
  with three other courses. The session will
  <bold>
   start at 2 PM and finish at 4 PM
  </bold>
  .  IT is open to the public.  So feel free to invite your friends.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Our projects will be placed in the atrium, G03/05, and G20.  We will try to avoid G20, as it is hidden in the corner.  The tables will be labeled with our class's name. Each team will get a table for your project.  Power strips will be provided.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  TA and I will arrive by 1:30 PM to help each team to set up.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Here is the to-do list for you:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1.
  <bold>
   Move all your hardware to the location by 1:35 PM
  </bold>
  .  Based on our experience,
  <bold>
   it takes 20-30 mins
  </bold>
  to set up and debug the hardware at a new location.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. The tables are first to come and first serve.  You can have more options for tables and locations if you come early.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  3. The teaching team will stop by every table to see each demo, which will be used for grading.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  4.
  <bold>
   If your projects are in G20 now,
  </bold>
  you do not need to move the project back to Rhodes.  The staff member will move some tables out of G20. So your projects may need to be placed on the floor to empty the table.  If you do not want this, you can move your projects to G03/05 tonight or tomorrow.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Looking forward to your demo. Let us know if you have any questions.
