 Hi All, I will be offering an additional office hour this week as well as moving things around slightly. My OH schedule for this week is below...
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Thursday (4/14) 6 PM - 7 PM
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Friday (4/15) 4:45 PM - 6:45 PM
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 Note that these are some of the last times to get help with your final project or design project before they are due so I suggest stopping by if you need any help! Have a great week.
</p>
