 for our current project. The study will ask participants to wear a pair of earphones and speak silent commands following the instructions on the screen. The estimated time for the user study is about
 <b>
  1 hour
 </b>
 . The compensation for taking the study would be
 <b>
  $15
 </b>
 . This study will be conducted in an experiment room on campus.

 We will strictly follow the instructions published by Cornell University and local health administrations to mitigate the viral transmission risk, including keeping contact record, minimizing human-to-human interactions, disinfecting any device and furniture used in the study.
