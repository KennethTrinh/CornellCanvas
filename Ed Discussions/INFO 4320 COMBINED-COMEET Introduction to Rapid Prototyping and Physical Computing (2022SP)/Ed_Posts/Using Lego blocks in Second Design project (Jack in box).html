 I got questions on whether you can use the lego block in the second design project today.  The original requirement only mentioned using gears and axles from the lego kit as shown below. After some discussions,
 <b>
  I think it is fine to use some Lego blocks in your Jack in a Box project, as long as the box was cut using a laser cutter.

 I hope this helps.

 This is the original requirement in the assignment on Cavnas:
</p>
<p>
 For this assignment you are asked to design and build a Jack in a Box toy with the following constraints:
</p>
<list style="unordered">
 <li>
  <p>
   The box and all the mechanisms must be build using a laser cutter (but you can use gears and axles from your Lego kit);
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   The animation mechanism should be inside the box;
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   The animation mechanism must use the motor, the servo, or the stepper provided in the kit;
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   The system must be controlled by your ESP32;
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   The mechanism might be triggered by opening the box or detecting an attempt to interact with the box;
  </p>
 </li>
</list>
