 Motor continues to run at full speed even after fully rewiring my board according to the schematic and running the LEDBreathing code given to us in class. Any help would be much appreciated.

  Did you try to use the LED Breathing code? Does this code change the speed of the motor?
 </p>
 <p>
  If yes, then it's likely a code issue.
 </p>
 <p>
  If no, then it's more likely a hardware wiring issue.
