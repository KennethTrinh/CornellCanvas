 I got asked about how to play sound on ESP32.  The short answer is that it is hard to play complicated sound (music) on ESP32 without adding new hardware.  There are two solutions:
</p>
<p>
 1. Play simple sound (pitches) using ESP32 and the speaker we have.
</p>
<p>
 2. If you want to play complicated sound/music using ESP32, you can use your laptop as the speaker and revised the Processing program we gave you on Lidar project.
</p>
<p>
 In"LiDar" mini-project, we communicate data from ESP32 to a visualization program (written in Processing) on your computer.
</p>
<p>
 You can simply revise that Processing program (we used in LiDar), to play sound (mp3) on your computer when receiving the targeted command of your choice from ESP32.
</p>
<p>
 Here is the sample on how to play sound using Processing:

</p>
<p>
 You just need a few lines to play the mp3 file .
