 For the automaton design project, for the new deadline of 11:59 PM on the 15th, are we still allowed to use slip days on the deadline? E.g. if we havenâ€™t used any slip days previously this semester may we submit as late as the 19th?
</p>
<p>
 Thank you!

  You can only use one slip day (if you have not used them up by now) on this assignment. Because when we allow the students to submit on May 15, we have already taken this into consideration.

 <p>
  TA will grade everything on May 19th.
