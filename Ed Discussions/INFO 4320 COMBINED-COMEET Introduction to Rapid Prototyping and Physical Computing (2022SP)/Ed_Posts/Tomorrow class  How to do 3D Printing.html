  Hi Everyone,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I hope you have enjoyed your break so far.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  In tomorrow's class, we will show you how to transform the files from Fusion 360 to do 3D printing using our printers.  This part only requires you to bring in your own computer.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I will use the rest of the class to answer any questions you may have on your individual design project 1 as well as the first cardboard prototype on your team project.
