 1. The last two paragraphs are saying very similar content in the description. Are we supposed to write it into distinct parts?
</p>
<list style="unordered">
</list>
<blockquote>
 (20%) An initial version of your design to be presented to your group TA about one week before the deadline. It should include: An overview of your design; A sketch of each feature you are considering, showing how it will work and how it will fit in the overall design; The sketch should be detailed enough to understand how the system will work. Your priority ranking of each feature indicating clearly which feature will be included in the basic implementation, and which feature will be considered as optional. Note that it is important to include optional features in your report since it will help us provide you feedback about the match between your ideas and expected complexity for class projects.

 3. What is defined as a feature? Is the plant dancing with music a feature? Is a proximity sensor sensing the distance between user and an object a feature?

  You should follow the description the best you can. The main points you want to hit for those sections is an overview of your design, all of the functional components, how each functional component fits into the design at large, and the priority/details of each component.

   Adding to this point, the reason why you see two sections is that we want each team to present the design with iterations.  You can first show your initial design with sketches before getting feedback from TAs. Then showing the revised design with sketches after adopting the suggestions from TAs.

   Adding onto this post, I am confused about whether the the report details listed under Deliverables are describing the final report to be submitted later and we just need to submit the "one to two columns 'Related Work' section", or whether we need to submit everything listed under Deliverables for this assignment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Could you please clarify this?

    Everything under deliverables should be included.
