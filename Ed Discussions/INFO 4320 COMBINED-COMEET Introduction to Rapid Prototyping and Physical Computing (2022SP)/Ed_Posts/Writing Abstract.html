  Are we supposed to write the abstract part in our assignment 'Previous Work and Objectives' (since it is a part of the CHI ACM template in most of the cases)? I know that this isn't listed in the deliverables so I wanted to make sure that we can potentially delete it completely? Thank you!

  You do not need an "Abstract", just use the format of the CHI ACM as a guide, not the content. However, remember that you still need the Introduction.
