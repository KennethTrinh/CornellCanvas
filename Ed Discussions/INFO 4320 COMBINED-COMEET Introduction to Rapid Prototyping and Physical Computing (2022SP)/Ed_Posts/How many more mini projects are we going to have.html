 Do we also have mini projects due during the week where our individual assignment is due, and the group milestone is due ?

  We will have a mini-project every week where we have a Monday class.
 </p>
 <p>
  The best way to manage different assignments in class is to
  <b>
   start early
  </b>
  . Although mini-project only has a few days to finish, we usually have several weeks for the design project and team project.
 </p>
 <p>
  For instance, we will not have any mini projects due next week after the break.  This is a great time for working on design project 1 and the team project.
