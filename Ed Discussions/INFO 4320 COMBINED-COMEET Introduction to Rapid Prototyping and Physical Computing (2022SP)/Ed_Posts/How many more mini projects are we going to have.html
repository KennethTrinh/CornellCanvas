  We will have a mini-project every week where we have a Monday class.

  The best way to manage different assignments in class is to

   start early

  . Although mini-project only has a few days to finish, we usually have several weeks for the design project and team project.

  For instance, we will not have any mini projects due next week after the break.  This is a great time for working on design project 1 and the team project.
