  My 3d model has multiple bodies and animated joints, when I export it to an stl, Prusasliver shows them as one single body. Is there a way to export an stl with all the bodies laid out flat, without having to undo the joints?

  I do not know a way to do that.  Usually, you need to print the body pieces separately.
