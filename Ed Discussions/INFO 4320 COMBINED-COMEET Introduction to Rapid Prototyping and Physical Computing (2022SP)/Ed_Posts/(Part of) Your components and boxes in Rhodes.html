 Hi all,
</p>
<p>
 Part of your orders have arrived and we have sorted them out and distributed to different boxes with each team's team number on it. Feel free to check them out but please keep the room clean and organized. Please let the TAs know if you find items in your box that you did

 purchase (it's OK if some parts are not there because not all components have arrived).

 We only have limited amount of space and big boxes, so we assigned them based on the size of components we have received. The box is usually used to store the components (not your prototype itself unless it's very small). Please let the TAs know if you believe that your team needs a bigger box.
</p>
<p>
 Have a great spring break!
