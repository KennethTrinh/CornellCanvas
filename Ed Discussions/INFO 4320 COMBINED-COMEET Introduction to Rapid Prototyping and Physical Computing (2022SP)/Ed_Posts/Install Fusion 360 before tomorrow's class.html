  It asked me for a picture of my student ID and would not let me download it after I've uploaded it. Is anyone else having the same problem?

  I didn't need to send a picture of my student ID, after the link I went to "Get Started" &gt; "New to Autodesk? Create Account" &gt; and then I put in my school credentials and then let me download it

  For some reason Autodesk can't verify my identity even though I uploaded my transcript. Is anyone else having the same problem?
