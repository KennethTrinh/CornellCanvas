 Hi Everyone,
</p>
<p>
 We will start working on 3D Design using Fusion 360.
</p>
<p>
 Please install the software before the class. We will need the software in class.
</p>
<p>
 You should be able to get a free license as a Cornell student as detailed below:

  For some reason Autodesk can't verify my identity even though I uploaded my transcript. Is anyone else having the same problem?

   It asked me for a picture of my student ID and would not let me download it after I've uploaded it. Is anyone else having the same problem?

    I didn't need to send a picture of my student ID, after the link I went to "Get Started" &gt; "New to Autodesk? Create Account" &gt; and then I put in my school credentials and then let me download it
