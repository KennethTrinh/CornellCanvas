 Hi Everyone,
</p>
<p>
 I hope you have enjoyed your spring break.  A quick reminder, pls bring both the
 <b>
  Lego box
 </b>
 and your
 <b>
  hardware box
 </b>
 to the class tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
 As we said last week, we will work on using H-Bridge to control the direction of the motor which is driving the Lego gears you assembled last week.
</p>
<p>
 See you in class.
</p>
