  Hi Everyone,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I hope you have enjoyed your spring break.  A quick reminder, pls bring both the
  <bold>
   Lego box
  </bold>
  and your
  <bold>
   hardware box
  </bold>
  to the class tomorrow.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  As we said last week, we will work on using H-Bridge to control the direction of the motor which is driving the Lego gears you assembled last week.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  See you in class.
