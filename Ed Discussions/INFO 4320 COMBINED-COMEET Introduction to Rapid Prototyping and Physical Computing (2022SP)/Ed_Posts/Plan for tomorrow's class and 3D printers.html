  Hi Everyone,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  We will continue using tomorrow's class time as the workshop sessions to work on your projects (team projects or individual design projects).
  <bold>
   Please take advantage of these class times to get feedback from the teaching team on your projects.
  </bold>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  To address the massive need for 3D printers in the coming days,
  <bold>
   we will move two 3D printers to Rhodes 114 today or tomorrow.
  </bold>
  They can only be used via SD card printing ( we have 3D cards in the room). Please let us know if you have any questions.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  We also need to stop using Rhodes 100 for project space, as we get exclusive access to Gates G20 as our new project space.
