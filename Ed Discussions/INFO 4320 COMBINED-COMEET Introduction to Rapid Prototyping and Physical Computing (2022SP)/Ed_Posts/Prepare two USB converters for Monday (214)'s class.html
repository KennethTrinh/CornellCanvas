  Hi Everyone,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  We will work on a logic analyzer and digital/analog IO next week.  We need two USB ports on your computer to connect to the logic analyzer and microcontroller at the same time.

   If your computer has two onboard USB ports, you are fine.

   If your computer needs a converter for each USB port, please bring in two converters, so that you can use the two components together in class.

  We will also need two breadboards ( one large and one small) for this assignment.
