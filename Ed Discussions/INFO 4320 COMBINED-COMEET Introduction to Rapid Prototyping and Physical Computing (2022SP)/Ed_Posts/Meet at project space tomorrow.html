 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 We will not meet in Rhodes 114 tomorrow. Instead, please use the time to work on your team projects.
</p>
<p>
 We have three rooms for working on projects :
</p>
<p>
 1. Rhodes 114.
</p>
<p>
 2. Rhodes 129.
</p>
<p>
 3. Gates G20: please note that G20 will be used for the poster/demo session on Thursday. Thus, we need to clean this space by the end of Wed.
</p>
<p>
 The teaching team will be split into these rooms to support you on your projects.  See you in the project space tomorrow.
</p>
