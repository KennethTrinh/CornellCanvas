  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  We will not meet in Rhodes 114 tomorrow. Instead, please use the time to work on your team projects.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  We have three rooms for working on projects :
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1. Rhodes 114.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. Rhodes 129.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  3. Gates G20: please note that G20 will be used for the poster/demo session on Thursday. Thus, we need to clean this space by the end of Wed.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The teaching team will be split into these rooms to support you on your projects.  See you in the project space tomorrow.
