 Hi Everyone,
</p>
<p>
 As I said in last Monday's lecture, we will work on an advanced 3D design using fusion 360 in tomorrow's class.  I will also spend some time showing how to connect your ESP32 microcontroller to WIFI.
</p>
<p>
 Given the coming deadlines this week, this coming Monday's lecture and mini-project are intended to be light-weighted.
</p>
<p>
 I expect there will be plenty of time left, which you are welcome to work on your 1st design project or team project.  As always, the teaching team will try their best to answer any questions you may have on any of the projects.
</p>
<p>
 See you tomorrow.

   Yes. Pls bring them in.

   We will show how to connect ESP32 to WiFi which will use the micro controller.

    The new ones are expected to arrive tomorrow. Not sure whether we can get it before class.
   </p>
   <p>
    I found an extra one, which I will bring to the classroom tomorrow.  I also asked TA to find more to bring into the classroom as well.
   </p>
   <p>
    If there is not enough board for replacements, I will encourage the students who have submitted their mini-project to share their boards.
   </p>
   <p>
    I will replace them once new ones arrive.
