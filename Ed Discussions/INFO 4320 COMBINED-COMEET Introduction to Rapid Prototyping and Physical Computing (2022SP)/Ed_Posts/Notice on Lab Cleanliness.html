  Hi All, I wanted to remind you that our Lab (Rhodes 114) is a shared space, and it is up to all of us to keep it clean. The below image is very disappointing, and I have already on two separate occasions have had to clean up the lab due to it being unusable by other students (work materials covered all counter surfaces). Please do try and clean up after yourselves, it is vital towards making sure everyone can build their prototypes in a semi-clean lab space.
