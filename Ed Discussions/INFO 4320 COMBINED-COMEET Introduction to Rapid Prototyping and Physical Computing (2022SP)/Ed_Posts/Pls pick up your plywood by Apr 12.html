  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Most of you have picked up the plywood for your design project. If you have not done so, pls contact your TA and arrange for pick up by
  <bold>
   Apr 12
  </bold>
  .
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  After that date, we can start using the rest of the plywood for team projects. So there is no guarantee that there is plywood in stock for you to use on design projects.
