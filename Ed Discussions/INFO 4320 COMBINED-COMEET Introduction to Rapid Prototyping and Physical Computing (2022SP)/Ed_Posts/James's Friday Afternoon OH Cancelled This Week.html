  Hello all, I will be leaving Ithaca on Thursday afternoon and thus will have to cancel my OH this Friday afternoon. If this is a major issue for you, email me and we can schedule a time prior to Thursday, but we have many other OH times so maybe just find one of those. Have a great week and spring break!
