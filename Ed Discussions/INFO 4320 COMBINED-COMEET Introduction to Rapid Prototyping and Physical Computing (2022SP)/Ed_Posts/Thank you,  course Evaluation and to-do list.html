  Hi Everyone,

  Thank you all for a great demo session today.  I really enjoyed it and feel very proud of what you have achieved.   This is one of the best demo sessions I have attended during my time at Cornell!

   You should have received a course evaluation form.  if you can take a few minutes to fill out the form to provide feedback to me, I would really appreciate it.   If you really enjoyed the course, please let us know. If you think there are things the course can improve, we would love to learn as well. The course evaluation is critical for us to continue improving the course for the future.
