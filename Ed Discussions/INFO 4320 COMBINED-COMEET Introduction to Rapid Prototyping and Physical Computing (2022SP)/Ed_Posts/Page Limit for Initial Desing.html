 How strict is the page limit? The assignment writeup says 3-4 pages, but I am wondering whether, with all the images for initial and final designs, as well as the evaluation for each functional block, this might be a bit over the limit. Just wondering whether the page limit is strictly followed and if the points will be deducted if we're over it? Thanks!

  Yes. you can be longer than 3-4 pages. Your grade will not be impacted negatively for a longer writeup.
