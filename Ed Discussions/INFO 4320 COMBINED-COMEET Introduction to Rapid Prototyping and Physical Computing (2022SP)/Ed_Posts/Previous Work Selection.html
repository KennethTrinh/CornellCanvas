  Hi, I am a little confused about what kind of previous work we should choose. For example, should we only select the relevant Arduino projects, or can we also include the relevant commercial products? I am asking because the Arduino projects usually provide detail instructions on how to recreate; while commercial products will be too complicated to create, they have more features and look more attractive.

  Any project you can draw ideas from (pros/cons/etc.) that have previously worked to solve a problem similar to the one you are trying to solve, or accomplish the task you are trying to accomplish in your design. You are not going to follow a tutorial on how to build what you are trying to build, but take inspiration from these previous implementations. Your project should be entirely your own.
