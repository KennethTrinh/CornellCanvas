 My code currently converts the input from the serial monitor into an int and stores it into a variable. I'm trying to insert that int into an array so that each individual number is it's own element in the list. Ex: 123 -&gt; [1, 2, 3] so that I can refer to each individual number in a specific index and then create the morse code that way. Is there a way to do this?
