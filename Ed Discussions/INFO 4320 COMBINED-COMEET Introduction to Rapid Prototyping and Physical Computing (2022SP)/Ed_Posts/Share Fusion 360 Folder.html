  If we have shared the fusion 360 folder with the entire teaching staff, do we still need to upload the model files? I have already uploaded the screenshots of the models in the Canvas assignment.

  I changed the requirement. Sharing the folder creates a lot of issues.

  You can just submit the f3d file and the screenshots.
