  For the project description, it says "the automaton should have at least 6 parts", does this include the gears/cranks as well as static objects? Or does it need to be 6 parts of the automaton that are moving by gears?
 </paragraph>

 <paragraph>
  Also for printing gears, are we required to design the gears ourselves in Fusion 360? Or are we allowed to use files from the internet for gears?

  1. 6 parts include static objects.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. You can use files to design and print your gears (only gears).
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  3. Any imported components will not count in the 6 parts.
