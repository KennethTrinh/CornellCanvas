  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  In light of the coming spring break, I decided to make adjustments to the teaching schedule by lowering the complexity of the mini-project this week.   I hope you can finish the project in class.

  As a result, you only need to bring your hardware box to the classroom today.  We will do the lego-related mini-project when you come back from spring break.

  Sorry for the last min change.
