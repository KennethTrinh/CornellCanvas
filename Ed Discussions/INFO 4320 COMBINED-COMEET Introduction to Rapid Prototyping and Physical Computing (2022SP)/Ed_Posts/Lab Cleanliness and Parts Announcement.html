 Hello Class! Ben and I just spent 2.5 hours arduously cleaning up the lab in preparation for y'all to start building your projects. We plan on distributing your parts in your boxes (which will be labeled for you and ready by Thursday morning), which live on the metal rack in the middle of the room. Please
 <b>
  <i>
   keep your box in that spot and return it there when you are done working on your project
  </i>
 </b>
 .
</p>
<p>
 Also, please
 <i>
  <b>
   place any items you use back where you found them
  </b>
 </i>
 , always. Finally,
 <b>
  <i>
   if you create trash when you are working on your project,
  </i>
 </b>
 <b>
  <i>
   clean it up
  </i>
 </b>
 ! These are simple common sense rules of common courtesy, but despite our efforts, the lab continues to return to an unusable state. Help us help you, and help each other have a successful build process. Thank you!
</p>
<p>
 Enjoy the rest of your week and have a wonderful spring break.
</p>

 Note: All cardboard prototypes have been moved to Rhodes 100. Feel free to keep them in there, take them home, or throw them away, you won't need them physically again (although they may help you in the build process so I recommend against throwing them away for now), but definitely take lots of pictures!
</p>
