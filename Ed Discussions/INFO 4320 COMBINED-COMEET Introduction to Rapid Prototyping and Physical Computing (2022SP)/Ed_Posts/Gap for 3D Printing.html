  I am designing a structure in which one part needs to be inserted into another part. I learned from experience in laser cutting that if the gap is exactly the same as the part, they actually cannot fit together in the real world. How much more room should I leave for the gap so that they can fit together?

  For most cases you shouldn't need more than 1mm clearance. It's often better to air on the side of too tight because you can use a rasp or file to widen the hole/slot.
