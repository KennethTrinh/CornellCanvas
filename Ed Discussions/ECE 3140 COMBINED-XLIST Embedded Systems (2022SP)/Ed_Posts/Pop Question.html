  Hello,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If we push LR on to the stack, what are the possible ways we can pop it off the stack? I know that pop{LR} is illegal.

  When a register value is pushed onto the stack it means that 4 bytes are added to the stack. These 4 bytes do not inherently belong to a register as they are just data somewhere in memory. However, in general when you push a register's value onto the stack you will later want to pop that value off the stack into the same register.

  So, to answer your question, you can technically pop into any of the registers that the POP instruction allows for (i.e. R0-R7 or the PC, see page A6-165 of the manual). That being said, in general you will want to POP the address into the PC register.

  So, instead of two instructions--POP {LR} and BX {LR}-- you only need POP {PC}?

  If you look at the documentation, POP {LR} is not possible. Instead you need to do POP {PC}. I suppose you could POP the memory address into a different register and then use BX with that register but you might as well just use the POP {PC} since it would be quicker.

  Ok so push{LR} and POP{PC} go together, but say I don't need to push LR due to the program flow. Is BL &lt;lable&gt; and BX LR sufficient?

  As long as you don't have any function calls in the subroutine that you BL to then that should work. You only need to PUSH {LR} and POP {PC} if you make calls to subroutines
