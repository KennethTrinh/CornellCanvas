 Hello,
</p>
<p>
 If we push LR on to the stack, what are the possible ways we can pop it off the stack? I know that pop{LR} is illegal.

  When a register value is pushed onto the stack it means that 4 bytes are added to the stack. These 4 bytes do not inherently belong to a register as they are just data somewhere in memory. However, in general when you push a register's value onto the stack you will later want to pop that value off the stack into the same register.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, to answer your question, you can technically pop into any of the registers that the POP instruction allows for (i.e. R0-R7 or the PC, see page A6-165 of the manual). That being said, in general you will want to POP the address into the PC register.

   So, instead of two instructions--POP {LR} and BX {LR}-- you only need POP {PC}?

    If you look at the documentation, POP {LR} is not possible. Instead you need to do POP {PC}. I suppose you could POP the memory address into a different register and then use BX with that register but you might as well just use the POP {PC} since it would be quicker.

     Ok so push{LR} and POP{PC} go together, but say I don't need to push LR due to the program flow. Is BL &lt;lable&gt; and BX LR sufficient?

      As long as you don't have any function calls in the subroutine that you BL to then that should work. You only need to PUSH {LR} and POP {PC} if you make calls to subroutines
