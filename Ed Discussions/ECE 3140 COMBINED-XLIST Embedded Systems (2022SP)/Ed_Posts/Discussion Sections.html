 Are the discussion sections meeting at the scheduled times? During lecture Dr. Napp said that the lectures are basically flipped, but I'm not sure if he talked about how discussions work. Also, are there separate zoom links for the discussion sections if we are supposed to go?

  Discussion NEXT week will be online, and after that in person. I'll get the zoom links for next week later today so that they show up on your schedule.
