  We used Aaron's LCD stuff, and to facilitate that we just moved our project files into the frdmkl46z_slcd example project. Can we zip this and upload a zip to our git as our project submission?

  If you know you to use git, please upload the the source code as .c .h .s files. It makes it easier for us to inspect.

  If you have not used git and it is easier to upload a zip, that is fine too.
