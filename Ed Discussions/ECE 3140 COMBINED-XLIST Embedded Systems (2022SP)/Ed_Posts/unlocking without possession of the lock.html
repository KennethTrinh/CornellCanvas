  If a process calls unlock on a lock without currently having access to the lock, should the lock unlock and give ownership to the next waiting process? Is this how we 'force' infinite processes to give up a lock?

  I believe we can assume unlock(l) is only called by processes that currently hold the lock.

  I mean you can implement unlock(l) with that assumption, but you have to ensure that unlock is only called by a process that has the lock wherever you use it.

  I don't think that's possible - consider a process that does nothing but unlock the lock (without first obtaining it).

  thats what i mean by you have to ensure unlock is only called by a process that has a lock "wherever you use it", like correct usage of unlock() is guaranteed by the user/client, not the implementer

  If a process tries to acquire a lock that is already in use, it is blocked and should be added to the associated blocked queue.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  An infinite process that acquires a lock and never releases can never be compelled to release that lock.
