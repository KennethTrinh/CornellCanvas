  Do we know the clock frequency of the board? I was just wondering because I wanted to calculate how many cycles the LED should be on for.

  You can look up the clock speed in the board's documentation. That being said, we only ask for the length of a dot to be within a certain time range. The range is large enough where you can experimentally determine a suitable number of cycles that falls within the time range
