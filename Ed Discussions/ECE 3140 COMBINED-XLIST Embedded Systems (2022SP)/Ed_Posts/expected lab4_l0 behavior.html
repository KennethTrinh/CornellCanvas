  Each process is defined by a delay, acquiring a lock, blinking the red and green LEDs (in sequence, not simultaneously), and then releasing the lock. This occurs for three iterations.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since two identical processes are defined and only one can hold the lock at a given point in time, you should expect to see the red LED blink and then green LED blink 6 times in a row.

   I get that the red light is lit up for slightly longer in some blinks. Is that incorrect behavior?
