 In my lab, I got my basic functionality between my two LED lights to work. However, I never really touched the process blocked /ready functionality of the lab? Within my own code, I think I just assumed the current process block was always ready as soon as it was in the front of the queue. Am I thinking of this correctly or should it be something else?

  Correct, in this lab our processes are always ready and never blocked by locks on shared variables. We will implement locks and blocking in lab4.
