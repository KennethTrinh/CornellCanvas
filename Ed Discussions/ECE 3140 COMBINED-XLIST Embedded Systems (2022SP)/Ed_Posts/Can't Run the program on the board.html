  Hi, after I built my program, I still could not run the code on my board.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The "Run.." button is not lit up. What should I look into? Thanks.

  It happens occasionally, I am wondering what can be causing it.

  I had a similar problem. I opened the debugger (blue button), stepped through the program a few lines, then closed all debugging sessions (red box), and it allowed me to run the program again. I think the IDE just sucks.
