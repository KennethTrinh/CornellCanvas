  I didn't quite catch the part of our lecture today about time conflicts for discussion. If I'd like to add a class that conflicts with my discussion, is there a way to be added to the online discussion/a full discussion?

  Can you try to find a section that fits with your schedule?

  The conflicts with lecture time are not an issue, but the discussion sections will be in person and often very helpful for the labs.

  Having a regular "online" discussion section is more of a Plan B, and there is no official section you can sign up for. You'll officially be in a conflicting session and need to fill out a time conflict form. In the justification for the time conflict you need to mention that you'll be able to get the material you miss online.
