 Hi, I was compiling for the tutorial but I ran into errors on these lines. It is on my MKL46Z4.h file and states that "expect ')' before '(' token" and "expected identifier or '(' before 'PORT_Type'" I am not sure why I am getting this error when I didn't change anything on the file.

  Can you post the entire error message in the console? The screenshot you shared looks normal so either you have some other problem in your project or you accidentally changed something above or below these two lines. You can also try to make a new project in case you did accidentally change the file
