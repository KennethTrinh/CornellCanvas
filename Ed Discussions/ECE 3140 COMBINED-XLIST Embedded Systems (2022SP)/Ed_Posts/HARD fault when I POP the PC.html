  I tried to pop the PC like previous posts suggested, now I am getting a hard fault.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I determined it when i popped the PC because I stepped over lines 1 by 1, and it takes me here when I try to step over the POP PC line:

  I dont ever push the PC, infact I actually push LR earlier; should be using BX LR?

  Most likely you are pushing a different number of times than you are popping. Look at the stack as I did in the factorial demo to make sure that what you push onto the stack when you do PUSH {LR} is the same as when you do POP {PC}. My bet is that you accidentally push more or less times than you pop, and/or you push/pop out of order so the wrong value is loaded into the PC

  If you are pushing LR then you'll need to pop that value into the PC (don't use BX LR)
