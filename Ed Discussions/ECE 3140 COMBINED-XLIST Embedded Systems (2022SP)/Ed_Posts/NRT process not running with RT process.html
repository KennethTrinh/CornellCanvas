 In the example test case, the RT process runs but the NRT process never does. If we comment out the RT process so that there is only the NRT process, the NRT process (red blinking) successfully runs. What could be the issue?

  Try stepping through and possibly put a breakpoint somewhere inside of process_select to see what exists in all of your queues/current_process, that could help
