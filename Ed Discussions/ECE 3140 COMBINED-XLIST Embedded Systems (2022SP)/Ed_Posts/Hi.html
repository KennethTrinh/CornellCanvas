  From the header file, it appears as though PORTD is used to reference the port in general, but PTD allow for additional functionality specific to GPIO. We use the first command to use the port as a GPIO, and the second to set the direction (it wouldn't make sense to set a direction on a port in general if it wasn't a GPIO)
