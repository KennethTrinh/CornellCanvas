 Someone else made a post with a similar issue. When I run through the given test case in debug mode, I can go through it line by line and it works perfectly exactly as I expect it to, I see the processes run and LEDs turn on and off, but when I flash the board, it does nothing. Any ideas on what is going or how to fix this.

  If you have any print statements, comment them out before building and flashing to the board

   Maybe it's an issue with the speed? It's possible that everything runs on the board so fast outside of debug mode that you can't see it

    How does one go about fixing that?

     Probably just trying different LDVALs, although I'm not sure how much that would really help if the issue is with the shortDelay and mediumDelay since those have nothing to do with it
