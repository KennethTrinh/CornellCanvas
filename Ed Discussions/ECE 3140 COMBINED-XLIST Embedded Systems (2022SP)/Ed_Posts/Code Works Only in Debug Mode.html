  Someone else made a post with a similar issue. When I run through the given test case in debug mode, I can go through it line by line and it works perfectly exactly as I expect it to, I see the processes run and LEDs turn on and off, but when I flash the board, it does nothing. Any ideas on what is going or how to fix this.

  Maybe it's an issue with the speed? It's possible that everything runs on the board so fast outside of debug mode that you can't see it

  Probably just trying different LDVALs, although I'm not sure how much that would really help if the issue is with the shortDelay and mediumDelay since those have nothing to do with it

  If you have any print statements, comment them out before building and flashing to the board
