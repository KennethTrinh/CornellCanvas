  My lab3 code compiles with no errors or warnings and it functions properly when I run the test cases on the board. However, if I step through the code with the debugger and look at the heap and stack usage, the stack usage will eventually show up as overflow. If I don't check this until the end of the test when we're in the infinite while loop, the stack doesn't show up as overflow. Is this something I need to be concerned about, or is this just the IDE being weird?

  You should ignore the stack usage percentages as we are switching stack pointers to addresses on the heap, confusing the IDE a whole lot.
