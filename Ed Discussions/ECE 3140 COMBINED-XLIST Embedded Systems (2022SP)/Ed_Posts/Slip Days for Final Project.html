  Can we use our slip days for the final project or is lab 5 the last time we can use them? Do we also choose our own partners for our final project and how many partners are we allowed to have?

  Slip days can only be used on labs, not for the final project. As said before, you are allowed to select your own groups for final projects (but are allowed to stay with your current partner if you both agree). Final project groups are a maximum of three students.
