 Hi, I just wanna double check whether we are allowed to use external resources like open source python code for a game interface/ website templates for the final project. Additionally, are there any specific requirements of how many lines of code we have to write/which languages we can use? Thanks in advance!
</p>

  You can use whatever external resources you wish, as long as you cite them and do not violate Academic Integrity. For the programming portion, only C written for the KL46Z will be graded. There is no guideline for "number of lines of code", only that "you have to use the board from class in some significant way." (Should be comparable to a lab)

   Do we have to cite code given to us in previous labs and SDK examples? Also, would this be good enough for a citation in the code:

    The references section on your website should include any relevant information (code used and purpose, original author, link, etc). See past project websites for examples.
