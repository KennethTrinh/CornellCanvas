<p>
 Should all the code for part 2 and part 3 go in the respective main functions? Would it be better coding practice to factor the code out into helper functions that I call in main, similar to switch_demo.c  from this week's discussion?
</p>
<p>
 For example, in main body of Framework2.c, I see
</p>
<p>
 NVIC_EnableIRQ(PIT_IRQn);
</p>
<p>
 /* enable PIT Interrupts (for part 2) */
</p>
<p>
 /* your code goes here */
</p>
<p>
 Would it be ok to replace the above three lines with a call to a helper function, say it is called operate_LED_interrupts() and within this function I have NVIC_EnableIRQ(PIT_IRQn);
</p>

  You may use helper functions, as long as your code is still clean, readable, and does not impact the performance of your program.
