  The global variable in global in for all the functions in mylab.c, and certainly in label!

  What I was trying to get at is that,  if you wanted to use it in a different .c. file, by including mymath.h, the compiler would complain that the variable is not defined during compilation. And myvar would be a label in the .o file but the linker should not use it for linking to other compilation units. If you wanted to make the variable available to other c-files you would need to somehow define it in mymath.h.
