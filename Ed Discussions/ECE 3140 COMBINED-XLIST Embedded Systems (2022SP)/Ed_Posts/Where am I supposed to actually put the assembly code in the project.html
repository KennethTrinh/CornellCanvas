 I tried to run what I had on the board but I realized i never  put the file into an actual project and that is probably messing things up. But when I made a new project I don't know where Im supposed to put .s files, do I just put it in the source as well?

  Yep, put the .s file in the source folder. I found it helpful to follow the project setup and instructions outlined in Lab 0.
