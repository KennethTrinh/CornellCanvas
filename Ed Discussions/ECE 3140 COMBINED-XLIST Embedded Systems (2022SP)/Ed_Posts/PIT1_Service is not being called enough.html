  We noticed that our current_time is not being updated fast enough. PIT1_Service is only being called a few times during each delay() call. The load value is not causing the expected behavior. We have the same setup for PIT channels 0 and 1 and give PIT_IRQn priority over SVCall_IRQn.

  Did you calculate the load value by doing:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Load_value = 0.001*clock_frequency_in_Hertz
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Notes:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  0.001
  <bold>
   second
  </bold>
  = 1
  <bold>
   millisecond
  </bold>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1
  <bold>
   Hertz
  </bold>
  = 1
  <bold>
   1/second
  </bold>
 </paragraph>

  Also, finding out the clock frequency can be a little tricky after some suggestions and a little testing I found mine was around 10.8 MHz (i.e. 10,800,000 Hz)

  Yes, we used this formula to calculate the load value. We also confirmed the clock speed.
