 I did lab0 perfectly fine and the application opened. However this came up when when as I was trying to start lab1. I restarted my computer but still get the same thing. Is there any fix?

  One method is to downgrade to an older version of MCUXpresso (11.3 or 11.4).

    You can uninstall / delete v11.5 and download an older version from the NXP website.

     When I went through lab0 tutorial, my mac installed SEGGER, and the IDE. Should I just delete the files from the applications directory? That's enough to uninstall the whole thing?
    </p>
    <p>
     After, I just follow the directions again and install the IDE + Board?
    </p>

     I still dont understand why it was working before and not now. Kinda weird

      You should be fine only uninstalling the MCUXpresso IDE from Applications. If you did start any work on lab1, you should make sure those files are backed up (even though they should be saved in a separate workspace folder).
