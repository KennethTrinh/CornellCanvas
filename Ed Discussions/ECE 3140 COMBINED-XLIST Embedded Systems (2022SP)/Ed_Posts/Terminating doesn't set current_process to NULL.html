  Instead, what it does is set cursp to NULL.

  Looking at what happens when a process terminates, the only variable that changes is that we set R0 to 0. This is the argument we're passing in to process_select. Nowhere does it change current_process to NULL. Should we design our code based on this? Just worried about failing autograder

  i thought this was expected and current_process is only NULL at the start?

  I understand that the lab3 document is slightly confusing. I did not write it but I will attempt to clarify. The support code
  <code>
   3140.s
  </code>
  and
  <code>
   3140_concur.c
  </code>
  has no reference or notion of
  <code>
   process_t* current_process
  </code>
  .
 </paragraph>
 <blockquote>
  This variable is set to NULL when a process terminates, and should also be NULL until process_start() is called.
 </blockquote>
 <paragraph>
  This should be interpreted as "you should set it [the process pointed to] to
  <italic>
   NULL
  </italic>
  when a process terminates, and [the pointer
  <italic>
   current_process
  </italic>
  ] should be set to
  <italic>
   NULL
  </italic>
  until
  <italic>
   process_start()
  </italic>
  is called."
 </paragraph>

  Obviously, the current process consists of various bits of
  <code>
   malloc
  </code>
  'd data so you will need to deal with that appropriately to avoid memory leaks.
