  The first couple of "rounds" of toggling work fine, but after that, the red LED toggles twice in a row and the green LED toggles twice in a row. In total, each LED still toggles six times, but they don't exactly go back and forth at the end. What might be causing this to happen?

  It's hard to say in general, but it sounds like your locks aren't guaranteeing safety - take a look at your l_lock() function and process_select(). How are you making sure that a blocked process isn't scheduled again?

  Thanks for your help! If anyone else has the same issue, it is worth looking at l_unlock() too and ensuring that the lock is locked after being passed to another process.
