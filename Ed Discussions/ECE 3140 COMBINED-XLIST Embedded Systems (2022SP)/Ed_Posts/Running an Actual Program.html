  I stepped through my program completely just to make sure it was branching and adjusting registers correctly. However, I don't know how to run the whole program. When I click the "run" button (green circle with white triangle in it), it asks me about run configurations, which I could not find anywhere in Lab0 or Lab1.

  You can use the GUI flash tool to run the entire program. It's the blue chip icon.

  Also when you're using the debugger, if you click the play button (yellow rectangle and green traingle), the program will run from where you are currently at in stepping.
