  Can someone explain what exactly is happening here (as in how the LED turns on and off)? I am still a little confused after watching it a few times. I don't know where =five is coming from and PCOR and PSOR are doing or if they're mixed up. Thank you!

  I think the constants for five and PCOR/PSOR should be defined somewhere within the source code, but we don't really need to worry about how it works as far as lab 1 goes.
