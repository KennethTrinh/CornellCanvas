 We're trying to get our SPI code to work, but we're having a lot of trouble. The example code imported from MCUExpresso doesn't work for us. We flashed the project containing the slave code to the slave board, and flashed the project containing the master code to the master board, and ran, thinking that the template projects would be set up so that even the bare minimum would work. But we can't see anything happening on ours boards or on either of our consoles. We can't figure out what is going on, and we're getting worried that we won't have a finished project by the deadline. What can we do?
</p>
<p>
 Any help would be appreciated. We're desperate to the point of thinking of an entire backup project just in case this doesn't pan out.

  If you are unable to debug/decipher the example code, you have two options: read the SPI chapter in the processor manual and set up the registers (similar process for figuring out GPIO in prior labs), or switch projects.

  SPI (and other communication protocols) is very tricky when you are unable to visualize the transmitted signals. If you do not have access to electrical equipment like an oscilloscope, I would recommend going to a different project.

   Thanks for the information. Given that it's so late in the timeline to go back to the drawing board, how likely would it be that the other TAs looking at basically a completely new project from scratch would be lenient in grading? I feel responsible since the original idea was mine to begin with; I shouldn't have been as ambitious with the plan.

    So far we've figured out that we soldered the wrong pins for spi, but we can't do anything about that until office hours on Monday.
