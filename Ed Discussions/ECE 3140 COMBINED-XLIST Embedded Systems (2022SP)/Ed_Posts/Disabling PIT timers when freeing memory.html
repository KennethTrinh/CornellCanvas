 When freeing memory from a process that is no longer running, we disable PIT interrupts temporarily in order to replicate an atomic action (for example in process_select funciton).
</p>
<p>
 However, now that we are using PIT_1 as a timer to maintain current time, would we want to disable both PIT timers briefly or just PIT_0?
</p>
<p>
 If PIT_1 is disabled while freeing the memory, it will not be as accurate of a timer, but if it is not disabled it may interrupt the memory freeing operation, so we are not sure which route to take

  We've only been disabling timer *interrupts*, not the timers themselves. Â The timers continue to tick when the interrupts are disabled, as they should.
 </p>
 <p>
  That said, in `process_select` interrupts are already disabled (by 3140.s) so that's two counts of don't worry about it.
