  Hi our group is trying to use a distance sensor. We need to trigger an input pulse and read from the pulse returned by the sensor. It looks like we need to use PWM to do that, but I am very confused about how to configure it. I wonder if there are any examples on using common external sensors? Thank you!

  This website gives example Arduino code based around a generic ultrasonic sensor.

  Thank you! But I am wondering for the digitalWrite part, do I just write to a GPIO output? And what should I do for reading the pulse in?
