 I'm having trouble determining which registers the arguments for the recursive Fibonacci calls will be stored. I would think the n-1 and n-2 arguments need to be stored in different registers and then their results could go in those respective unique registers. However, there is only one function, so in the function body I wouldn't know which register to access. is there a better way to think about this?

  I did it this way (not sure if it's correct though):

  First move n - 1 to the input register, call the fib function, then save the result in a register like R4 that is guaranteed to be maintained properly. Then store n - 2 to the input register, call the fib function again, and add the result to the value in R4 to obtain the final answer :)
