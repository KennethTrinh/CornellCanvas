 Hi!
</p>
<p>
 I was wondering if we'd received partial credit for the extra credit section. For example, if we write just the ec test cases, or write the ec test cases and do part of the first ec task, how much partial credit will be assigned?

  Fair enough lmao. May Napp grant me some good will and bump my grade up if it's on the edge even though I didn't finish the extra credit
