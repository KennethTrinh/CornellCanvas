  How should we display test cases? Right now I have them set up in main, ex: mov r0, #0 BL fib. However, since my implementation of morseDigit ends in the forever loop, only one test case can be run on each debug to the board. So I can have multiple test cases in main, but only actually execute one of them. Should I leave it like this or change my implementation of morseDigit so I branch to the forever loop after executing all of my test cases?

  example of change:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  main:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  test case 1
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  test case 2
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  test case 3
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  BL forever

  Why does your implementation of morseDigit end in the for loop? That's equivalent to calling a function that gets stuck in an infinite loop which would not be desired behavior
