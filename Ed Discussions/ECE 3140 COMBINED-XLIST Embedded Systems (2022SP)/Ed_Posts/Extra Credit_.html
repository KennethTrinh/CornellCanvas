  For the extra credit for Lab 1, should our code be able to handle the Morse code for only two-digit numbers, or should it also work for arbitrarily large numbers? Thanks!

  Your code should be able to work for arbitrarily large numbers (that fit into 32 bits).

  Should we also assume that we display the numbers from most significant to least significant?

  Yes. The digits should be flashed with the most significant digit first (e.g. the number 3140 should be flashed in the order 3, 1, 4, and then 0).

  Since it's arbitrary, can we store returned values in the stack?

  No. You cannot return things via the stack. It has to follow the calling convention:
 </paragraph>
 <list style="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    The SP has to be in the same location before and after the function call.
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    The  only possible return value should be in R0.
    <break>
    </break>
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
 </list>
 <paragraph>
  (A technical exception is if you were to pass the address of a local variable into the function and use it store the result there).  Then, the computed value is technically stored on the stack (because it is a local variable), but it is not accessed via push/pop, and the SP is still in the same location before and after the function call.

  Ah, right! I think I worded it poorly - I meant once we returned, storing the value that was returned on the stack (so that we could store an arbitrary number of values) - so some function would return a value in a register, and we would "store" the returned value by pushing the register to the stack once it returned

  No. The SP, has to be in the same location before and after the call. You can't leave anything on the stack.
