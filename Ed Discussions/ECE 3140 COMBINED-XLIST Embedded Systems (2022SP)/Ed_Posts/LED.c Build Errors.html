  I'm getting these errors when I try to build my LED.c file, but they go away if I add an empty main function. However, I know we're not supposed to have one, so how would I go about fixing this?

  The main function is always the entry point to a program and must be included somewhere for your project to compile. Just having your completed LED.c file (along side LED.h) will not compile. You can add some tests to Framework1.c to test the functionality of your LED functions.
