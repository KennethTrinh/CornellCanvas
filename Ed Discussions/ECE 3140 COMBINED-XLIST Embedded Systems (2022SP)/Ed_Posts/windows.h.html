 Hi, I am wondering if we can use "windows.h" since it has many built-in functions that we want to use like playSound(), Beep(), etc.

  I fail to understand your question. Do you mean in the context of the KL46Z? It does not make sense to
  <code>
   #include "Windows.h"
  </code>
  as the board does not run on Windows... (or any OS for that matter as our C programs are "bare-metal")
