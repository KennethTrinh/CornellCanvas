 As I browse through the projects from previous years, I found this on one's website saying that the py_serial.py was provided by Prof. Napp. I wonder if this can also be the case this year?
</p>
<p>
 Maybe also the accelerometer code?

    . For the accelerometer example code, you can checkout the Bubble SDK example. There's a picture of which example that is in this post:

   . Just a heads up though, I don't know if the accelerometer has been working for everyone or not.
