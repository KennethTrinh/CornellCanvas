 In lab 1, I am using a conditional branch BLE to execute a function. However, I have seen that BLE doesn't save the memory position as BL does. Is there any conditional branch that saves the memory position? If there isn't, how can I save the memory position of the program in order to come back to that point in "main" when I do BX in the function?

  BL is Branch with Link. BLE is Branch Conditional (signed less than or equal to). There are no conditional versions of BL. You will need to chain branches to get the effect of conditionally calling a function.
