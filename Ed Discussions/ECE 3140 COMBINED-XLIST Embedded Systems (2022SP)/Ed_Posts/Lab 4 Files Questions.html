 I was looking at the util and 3140_concur files that are included in the lab 4 zip folder versus the ones provided in lab 3. I noticed they had #include &lt;MKL25Z4.h&gt; instead of #include &lt;MKL46Z4.h&gt; which I think is based on the old board. In addition, the files in lab 4 includes functions for the blue LED whereas they were not included in the lab 3 files. Should we just use the same files from lab 3 because the rest of the files are the same except for the differences mentioned above?
