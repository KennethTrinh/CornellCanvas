  Hello Everyone,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  There was a scheduling conflict and Rhode's 310 is hosting a test, so our office hours for the rest of the night are canceled. I will be in Rhodes 380 for a little bit longer if you have immediate questions (Please do not go into Rhodes 310 they have a test). If you have any other questions you can put them here on Ed. Sorry for the changes.
