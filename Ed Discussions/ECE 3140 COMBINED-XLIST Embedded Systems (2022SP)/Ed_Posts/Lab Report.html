 For the lab report, do we describe in separate sections the design, coding, and review/testing for each LED.c, part1.c, and part2.c? Or should a description for each file be combined into one section (ie 9 sections or 3 sections)?

  Either is fine. Make sure you have all design, coding, and code review and testing sections, and they should contain specific details involved in implementing your lab2, like how to find timer values, the strategies used in the interrupt handler, long-short for LED, what the tested cases are, and how they were tested, and so on.
