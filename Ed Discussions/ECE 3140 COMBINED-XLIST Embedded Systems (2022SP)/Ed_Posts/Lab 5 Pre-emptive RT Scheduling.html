 Is EDF for this lab pre-emptive, and is there a possibility that processes will be created AFTER process_start() is called?

  EDF is pre-emptive, otherwise the scheduler would not be optimal.
 </p>
 <p>
  All processes will be created before
  <code>
   process_start
  </code>
  is called.

   If you know when the deadlines of every process are, when would a realtime process ever be pre-empted? Not sure if I'm misunderstanding the idea of pre-emption in RT

    We are acting as if the scheduler is not aware of all of the processes at play. It only knows when a process becomes available due to its start time, and schedules accordingly.

    We could technically analyze all processes in advance and perform EDD, but that is not the goal of this lab.
