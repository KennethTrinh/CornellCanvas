 Hi,

 Participation in Week 1, i.e. watching the lectures, will not count toward you grade, but  I posted the results so you can see that it is recorded correctly. The best way we found to automatically upload this information in bulk in a way that we can upgrade is as comment in CMS.  There is an new assignment on CMS called
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Lecture Video Participation
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 with no submission that is worth 1 point that is marked as graded. If you'd like to see how much of the lectures you completed click on it and then click on comments. You should see how much of the lecture you completed.  CMS wont allow me to make 0 point assignments, so everyone's will display a 1, no matter the completion grade.

 We will update this once a week after the lectures are due.
