  We are trying to run lcd demo (with the SDK) and it currently has no warnings but when I run it, random segments turn on/off and nothing is coherent.

  Have you read through #757? If you are having issues, I would recommend commenting there so Aaron can help you out.

  When I've seen this behavior it's because the correct support files and their content aren't included from the demo. Make sure you have all of the files and make sure that their contents are carried over properly. Some of the files (the ones in the board directory for example) have methods with the same name but the method bodies are different (since different demos need different pins set up)
