 How can we decide on a finite number n for an individual process's allocated stack space? If a process is something like fib calling itself recursively a bunch of times, wouldn't that end up overlapping in memory with another process at some point/run out of its own memory space?

  Correct, there is not a single
  <i>
   n
  </i>
  that satisfies calling
  <i>
   fib
  </i>
  with an arbitrarily large input. In terms of the prelab, it asking you to think about what values of
  <i>
   n
  </i>
  you will need to satisfy specific function calls such as
  <i>
   fib(5)
  </i>
  .
