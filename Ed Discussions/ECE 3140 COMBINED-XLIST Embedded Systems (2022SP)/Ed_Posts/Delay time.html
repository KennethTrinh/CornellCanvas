  I am confused about how to calculate the time delay. If the clock cycle of the board is A, will the time to go through the loop for one time be 1/A? In this case, do I just need to run for 0.3/A loops to delay for 0.3s? Thank you so much in advance.

  That is one way of doing it (make sure you keep your units straight though) Or you can experiment until you find a value that works (which is what I recommend doing as it most likely will be quicker).
