 There are several mentions of the report in different places throughout the project. The structure given to us on GitHub Pages is:
</p>
<list style="bullet">
 <li>
  <p>
   A Descriptive Project Name
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Introduction
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   System Overview &lt;--- Draft for Web Check In
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Project Video Demo (~3-4min)
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Detailed Technical Description
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Additional Resources Used
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Work Distribution (skip if you work by yourself)
  </p>
 </li>
</list>
<p>
 It also mentions that it should be similar to the lab reports. This structure, however, is missing key sections of previous lab reports. For example, do we not need to discuss our approach to testing?
</p>
<p>
 Additionally, on the project overview page, it's mentioned that "The final project webpage template will also include a section that is specific about what ideas from class you used in class". Is this an additional section?
</p>
<p>
 It would be useful to have a complete and/or slightly more descriptive specification for the report and demo.

  A testing section is required. Also, somewhere on your website you should include a section discussing what you used from the class and what you learned.
 </p>
 <p>
  See previous years' projects for examples. (Links on Final Project Overview page on Canvas or Final Project Megathread post on Ed)
