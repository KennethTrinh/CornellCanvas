 I am trying to use Morse Code with the button on the board, but I am having trouble creating interrupts for both button press and button release so that I can determine how long the button is pressed (and then whether it is a dot or a dash). I have the below line of code from switch_demo.c and see how to enable interrupts for one or the other but not both.

 Thanks!

 As well, I am having trouble finding in the manual how to access SW3 (the other button). I know SW1 used in switch_demo.c is accessed through PTC3, but cannot find how to access SW3.

  "Interrupts on either edge," It is already set up.
