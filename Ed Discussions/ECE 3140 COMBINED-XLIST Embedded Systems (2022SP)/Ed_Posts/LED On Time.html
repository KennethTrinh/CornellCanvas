  Is it fine if my LED stays on for longer than 1 second rather than the time it says on the handout for a dot?

  Is there a way to find out exactly how long the LED stays on or are we just trying to eyeball it?

  yes, you can just eyeball it. If it helps you can have it blink for a known amount of time (e.g. 15 seconds), then divide the number of flashes/pauses you count by the number of seconds

  I think eyeball - you should be able to certainly get it within the range of 0.3-0.8s
