 Is it fine if my LED stays on for longer than 1 second rather than the time it says on the handout for a dot?

  No, you need to follow the specs outlined in the lab handout

   Is there a way to find out exactly how long the LED stays on or are we just trying to eyeball it?

    I think eyeball - you should be able to certainly get it within the range of 0.3-0.8s

     yes, you can just eyeball it. If it helps you can have it blink for a known amount of time (e.g. 15 seconds), then divide the number of flashes/pauses you count by the number of seconds
