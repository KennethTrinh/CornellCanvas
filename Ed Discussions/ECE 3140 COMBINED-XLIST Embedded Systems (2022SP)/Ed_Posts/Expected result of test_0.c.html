  I understand that this file should make the red and green LEDs blink concurrently, however, in testing my partner and I were wondering if the fact that our interrupt period is relatively long (0xA50000) would mean that in concurrent execution both LEDs should never be on at the same time?

  Your interrupt period should be sufficiently short to give the illusion of concurrency between the LED's. If your test_0.c results in a fairly noticeable difference between the LED's, then you should go back and change your interrupt load value to avoid this

  Correct, this means that your load value should be in the order of micro/milliseconds, not on the order of seconds.

  ok thank you. so just to clarify, should the LEDs be blinking together or at different rates?

  The LED's should appear (from a human perspective) to blink at the same time. They won't be

   exactly

  together (on the order of milliseconds), but the idea is that the processes switch off at a rate fast enough that the LED's toggling appears simultaneous to a human observer
