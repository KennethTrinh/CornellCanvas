 Hi
</p>
<p>
 Just wondering what peer programming and naming conventions in the Code Review and Testing section of the report means? Can we have some examples? Thanks in advance.

  Peer programming or also pair programming is a technique for coding with 2 people. You might have done this technique unknowingly (feel free to look it up to see what it is).

  In programming there are some generally accepted naming conventions for things like functions and different variables. Did you follow any of those conventions? It is okay if you didn't, this is just the place to mention it if you did. Or mention how you decided to name things.
