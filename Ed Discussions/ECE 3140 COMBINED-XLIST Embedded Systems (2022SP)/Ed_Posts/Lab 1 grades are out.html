  We haven't uploaded the prelab score to CMS yet. Your prelab score on Canvas will be counted.

  My function for part 2 was called Morse_Digit instead of MorseDigit (naming convention error) and I got 10 points off out of the 20 points for part 2. Besides this, I followed all specifications correctly. My code follows this naming convention everywhere and all code runs correctly. Can I appeal this?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I don't think a naming difference warrants taking 50% points off when we are being tested on caller-callee convention on part 2.

  I got off for the same thing, -10 for a misunderstanding of how a method is supposed to be named is ridiculous, especially when the method works correctly

  Same issue. I named my label morse as I didn't even realize that the label was required to have the name MorseDigit (shown in C code).

  No, extra credit points aren't directly added to the lab grade. All extra credit during the semester will be taken into account when assigning final grades.

  If we submit regrade requests for the issue Vinita pointed out will we possibly get points back or no (the misnamed function being 10 points off)
