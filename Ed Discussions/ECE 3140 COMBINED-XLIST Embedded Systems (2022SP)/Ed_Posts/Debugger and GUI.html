  If I run my code in debugger mode, the LED blinks well. However, If I run my code using the GUI Flash tool, the LED doesn't blink at all. Does it mean that there are some errors in my code? If it does, how can I fix it? Thank you so much in advance.

  This is most likely the same problem as #126
