 When I build my project with the little hammer icon, I'm getting a standard message that says 0 errors, 0 warnings. But when I attempt to use the GUI flash tool to download the project onto the board, It says that I cannot run it because there is 1 error detected. Is this a problem anyone else has experienced, or knows how to fix?

  I have also tried undoing any changes I've made since I was last able to run it, but it still is not working even though the code is identical to what I had earlier when I was able to run it. My thought is that it isn't an error with the code, but rather with something else, but I don't know what else it could be because I haven't (intentionally) changed any settings or anything else since I was last able to run the code.

  Update: Turning my laptop off and back on again seemed to do the trick
