 I notice that the Lab 4 Team Evaluation is due on Wednesday, April 6. When can I expect this to go live on Canvas?

  The eval should be available on Canvas now.  Aloso, apr 6 is also a mistake! We don't make anything due during the break. The evaluations will receive full credit if you fill them out by the Wednesday following the April break.
