  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For today's lecture time, we will have Greg Malysa from Timesys talking about security in embedded systems. The talk will be about security in general and also what his work as an embedded engineer looks like, he will be around for a Q&amp;A afterward if you are curious.

  The talk is remote and the zoom link is here:

  While lecture time attendance is not mandatory, I will take attendance and use this to make up any missing attendance (lecture watching) for the course.

  Hope you can make it!
