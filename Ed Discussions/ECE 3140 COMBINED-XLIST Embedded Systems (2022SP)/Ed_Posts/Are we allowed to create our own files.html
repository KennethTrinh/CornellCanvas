  In addition to the files specified by the lab, we also have files shared_funcs.h and shared_funcs.c where we have our enqueue() and dequeue() functions as well as some global variables. Is it okay to turn in these files too, or must we have everything in only the provided files?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If we can't turn in these extra files, are we allowed to just move it to shared_structs.h(/.c) ?

  After asking in lecture, Professor said that it's difficult to grade with extra files (as they don't know the structure), so I think he would prefer if not. You should just be able to define the functions/variables inside the files where they're used (see #574)
