 After we run our project on the board, the green LED just stays on after doing the expected behavior. Is this supposed to happen?

  This can be answered by looking at your code. What state does your code leave your LED in? (Keep in mind that an odd number of toggles will leave it on). After your processes are done completing, what does main() do?
