 I know that the lab handout for Lab 5 states that "This file is modified compared to the previous labs to handle the second PIT channel,
 <b>
  but is compatible with previous lab handouts.
 </b>
 "
</p>
<p>
 However, I just tried going back to Lab 3 and swapping out the original Lab 3 3140.s file for the Lab 5 3140.s file and got a hard fault as depicted by the sequence of debugging screenshots below. On second thought, I don't know if it's the stack overflow as depicted by the IDE, since I would assume that the stack would just expand into the memory originally saved for the heap.

 Regardless, when I switch back to the original 3140.s file from Lab 3 the program runs smoothly as usual. I was wondering if we needed to take extra steps relating to the new 3140.s file in Lab 5 to prevent this issue?

   NEW SOLUTION:

 </p>
 <p>
  <underline>
   Replace your current 3140.s file with the new updated 3140.s file that the TAs posted today as Scott said in the comment below.

   OLD SOLUTION. DO NOT USE. IF YOU ADDED THE 2 LINES HIGHLIGHTED BELOW TO YOUR process.c FILE REMOVE THEM AS INSTRUCTED BY SCOTT IN THE COMMENT BELOW:

 </p>
 <p>
  A temporary fix found by the TAs in the Help Session was to add the following 2 lines highlighted below to the top of your process.c file. They said they would probably be implementing a fix later on.

   We've updated 3140.s to fix this! If you've added the two lines for my temporary fix, please remove them as now with the permanent fix it'll cause a multiple definition error.

   Due to the nuances of the different labs, the two 3140.s files are slightly different - you can see this if you open them up. My guess is the hard fault came from the fact that 3140.s from Lab 5 tried to access PIT Channel 1, when it wasn't initialized in Lab 3
