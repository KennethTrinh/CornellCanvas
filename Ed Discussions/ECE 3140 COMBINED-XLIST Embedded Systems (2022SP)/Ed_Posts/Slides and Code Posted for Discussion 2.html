 Hi all,
</p>
<p>
 The slides and demo code have been posted for discussion 2 under the Discussion module. There is a set of review slides for assembly and a set of slides that detail how to do the demo yourself and questions to help your understanding. During discussion this week you will be receiving your boards so if you prepare a project with the demo code beforehand you can follow along in section.
