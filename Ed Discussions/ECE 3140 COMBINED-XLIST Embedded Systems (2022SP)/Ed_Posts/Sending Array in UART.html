  An array of what? There are many different ways to do this depending on your needs.
 </p>
 <p>
  Let's say you have some array of
  <code>
   uint8_t
  </code>
  of unknown length (8 bit unsigned integers). Your data transmission could be sending the raw data of the entire array, ending with some type of terminator (
  <code>
   '\0'
  </code>
  or other). When you receive the data, you can store a buffer of all the data received up to the terminator, and then split by byte to get your array back.
