  When do lectures become available for the week? I was trying to get ahead on lectures but the next section on canvas seems empty.

  I finished the lectures in the wee hours of the morning and they should be there now. I'll get next week's lectures earlier (Sat, morning) so that you have a little more time to watch them before the Lecture times.
