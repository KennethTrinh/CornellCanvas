  How precise does the interval have to be? My LEDS are blinking, but not synchronously, the green LED turns on a tiny bit after the red. I can't tell if this is due to my PIT timer interval, or just issues with my process_select. I've also tested several values for the PIT timer

  What if you're like 100,000 off in decimal, would that affect it a lot?

  Due to the limitations of human vision, there is a wide range of valid time intervals. While running
  <code>
   test_0.c
  </code>
  , the processes should look concurrent.

  If you can see that they are not running concurrently, you should probably change your interval.
