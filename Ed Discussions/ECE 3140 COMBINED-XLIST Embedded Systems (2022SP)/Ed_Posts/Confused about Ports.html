 Why does Port D represent the green LED? How do I figure out which port to represent the red LED?

  Port D itself does not correspond to the green LED. It is Pin 5 on Port D (PTD5) that is electrically connected to the cathode of the LED. The schematic on page 5 of the lab 2 document shows the connections between the red and green LEDs and the corresponding pins and ports.
