 Hi!
</p>
<p>
 I'm trying to do PID control on our motor and I need to read analog inputs from a potentiometer and write analog PWM outputs to the motor. I'm not too sure how to do it. I looked through the ADC and DAC samples but they seem to use buffers? I just need to read and write values of 0 to 255. Are there any suggestions on how to go about doing this? Thank you!

  Did you get the analog read to work? I'd love any advice!

   I got PWM to work using the TPM (chapter 31), although I'm not sure what exactly you mean by analog PWM.
