  Hi!
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I'm trying to do PID control on our motor and I need to read analog inputs from a potentiometer and write analog PWM outputs to the motor. I'm not too sure how to do it. I looked through the ADC and DAC samples but they seem to use buffers? I just need to read and write values of 0 to 255. Are there any suggestions on how to go about doing this? Thank you!

  I got PWM to work using the TPM (chapter 31), although I'm not sure what exactly you mean by analog PWM.

  Did you get the analog read to work? I'd love any advice!
