 Hi there!
</p>
<p>
 I'm confused about the functionality of &amp; can I get a clarification?
</p>
<p>
 Are you only supposed to use it if you have double pointers???
</p>
<p>
 Thank you! :)

  &amp; means "address of" so if you had some variable x, the expression &amp;x would be the address of x. if you have a pointer and want to turn it into a double pointer, you would put &amp; before the name of the pointer. for example, y is a pointer and for some function c you need to input a pointer to y (thus a double pointer) you could do c(&amp;y)
