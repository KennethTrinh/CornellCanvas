  Hi, I believe that in the discussion when we talked about the linked lists, we used a double-pointer to keep the track of the first node right?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  But in lab3, process_queue is just a pointer. My understanding of the process_queue is that it is used to keep track of the first process right?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thanks a lot!

  Exactly! process_queue is just a pointer, but in some cases, you may want to create a pointer to it. This comes up if you are defining functions that take this in as a parameter - see below:
 </paragraph>
 <pre>void list_function(process_t* process_queue, process_t* process_to_append)
{
    &lt;some code that updates process_queue&gt;
}

list_function(process_queue, process_to_append)</pre>
 <paragraph>
  Here, if we update process_queue as passed in, we will only be updating the local variable inside the function, not the variable outside of a function. Instead, we would want to pass in a pointer to process_queue:
 </paragraph>
 <pre>void list_function(process_t** process_queue_pointer, process_t* process_to_append)
{
    &lt;some code that updates process_queue&gt;
}

list_function(&amp;process_queue, process_to_append)
// &amp;process_queue gets a pointer to process_queue</pre>
 <paragraph>
  Now, we can change the variable process_queue outside of the function by dereferencing process_queue_pointer. In general, if you want to edit a variable outside of a function, you need to pass a pointer to it, or else you'll only be editing a local copy inside of the function
