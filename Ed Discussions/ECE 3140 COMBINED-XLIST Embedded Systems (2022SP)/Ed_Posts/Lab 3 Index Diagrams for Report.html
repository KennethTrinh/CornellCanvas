 Hello! My partner and I wanted to double-check our diagram ideas because this lab didn't specify which diagrams they wanted to be drawn for the index section of the lab report. Also to see if it was necessary?
</p>
<p>
 Ideas:
</p>
<p>
 1. Our board modeling the test cases
</p>
<p>
 2. PCB Stacks from lectures for our processes

  You won't lose points for not including drawings or diagrams in your report
