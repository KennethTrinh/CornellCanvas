 Hello,
</p>
<p>
 A few  students have run into some hardware issues with their computer or were unable to successfully install the IDE on their operating system.  For students who cannot use their own computers for whatever reason, we installed MCUXpresso on some of the computer lab computers the computer lab
 <b>
  Phillips 318.
 </b>
 The front row (
 <b>
  Computers 1-5
 </b>
 ) should have the IDE and board SDK installed. If there are any issues with these computers please reply to this thread.
</p>
<p>
 If the board SDK is not installed follow the "manual installation" steps in Lab 0. Since you don't have administrator privileges on the lab computers, the GUI way of installing the board SDK will fail.
</p>
<p>
 Hope this helps!
</p>
<p>
 Best,
