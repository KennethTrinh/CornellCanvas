  Hi, we want to monitor variables in c with python, but the methods we found online seems to be incompatible with mcuxpresso's ide. We also tried writing data to an external .txt with c and then reading the data with python, though the 'fprintf' function only worked on c files created elsewhere, but not within mcuexpresso's ide. Do you know how we can achieve this or is there any ways to get around it? Thank you!

  I am confused about your set up. Are you trying to send data from your board to your computer (UART) and then parse it with python? If so, just use the example UART .c file and serial python script. Otherwise, please explain your set up and what you are trying to accomplish.
