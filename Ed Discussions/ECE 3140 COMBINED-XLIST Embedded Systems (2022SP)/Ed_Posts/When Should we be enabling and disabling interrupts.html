  They already disable interrupts when they call your
  <code>
   process_select
  </code>
  and
  <code>
   PIT1_Service
  </code>
  functions in assembly (and re-enable them afterwards). So you don't really need to there. I don't really think you have to do it anywhere yourself for this assignment.
