  Will we get points deducted if we didn't find the inner logic of Morse code, but simply case match against 10 different cases?

  No but try to find the inner logic. It will make your code a lot easier to write and debug.

  Hint: take the binary value 11111_00000_11111 (a dash is 1 and a dot is 0) and shift it by R0. Notice what you get in the 5 least significant bits.
