 How do we get this goofy function to trigger? I thought the
</p>
<p>
 NVIC_EnableIRQ(PIT_IRQn);
</p>
<p>
 line makes it trigger automatically but my code is just never going into the IRQ. I know it is never going in there because currently I'm only turning the LEDs on. The LEDs are not turning on. Never. They are always off. Therefore I never enter the interrupt handler. Is there anything else I need to do? I'm using the same setup code as I did for part2 which works, so I know my timer is working correctly.
</p>
<p>
 So why is it never entering the interrupt code????

  Are you setting the Timer Interrupt Enable correctly (see page 593)? This is an additional thing you have to do in your setup code in addition to what you have for part2.
