  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  There are a few questions about return the boards. There are two places:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  You can either drop them off at:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  In Phillips Hall 224 (Patricia Clark)
  <break>
  </break>
  Hours: 8:00a12p, 1p-4:30p M-F
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  or
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  In Rhodes Hall 314 (Kim Budd)
  <break>
  </break>
  Hours: 8:30pm - 4:30pm
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  Both places have a  box with a list of NetIDs and you should cross of your name if you drop off your board.  (You can drop of boards for friends too if that is easier).
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  If these times don't work or you leave early you can also get them back to me next semester or leave them by my office door (Rhodes 334) after hours. If you go that route, please leave a note with you NetID inside the box.

  You can drop them off with Kim Budd in Rhodes 314 once you get back. You don't need to contact us beforehand.
