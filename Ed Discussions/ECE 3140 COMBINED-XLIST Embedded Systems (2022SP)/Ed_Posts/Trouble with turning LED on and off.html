  When I step through my lines of code I can see my green LED turning on and off when I want it to (although it turns on during setup?) but when I run it normally I only get the LED on. Is this because Its moving through the code too fast to be able to see the setting on/off? I tried adding NOPs in between to take more time but that doesn't seem to be helping at all.

  Please see #95. If you are off by a few orders of magnitude, it will be impossible to see the LED change state.
