 How do I set up port D pin 5 as an output? I've looked at page 193 and 838 of the manuals but none of the diagrams translate to code that I understand how to write. I know I need to set the PDD for pin 5 to 1 (general-purpose output), but I'm not sure how to do this.

  Have you taken a look at last week's demo in discussion? We set up the red LED from start to finish

   Ok, I think I got it. Thank you.

   I have another question: in the lab handout it says to set PTB18 to toggle the LED, but in discussion we are told that PTD5 controls the green LED and PTE29 controls the red LED. Additionally, the example code we are given only sets up PTD5. Where/how do we modify PTB18?

    I think this is a mistake from last year's board. Use the PTD5 and PTE29 to toggle the LEDs
