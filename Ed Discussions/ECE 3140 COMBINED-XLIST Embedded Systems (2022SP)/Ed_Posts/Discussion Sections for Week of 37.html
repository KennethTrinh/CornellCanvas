  This week in discussion section you will get a chance to meet with your lab partner for labs 3-5. Additionally, be sure to bring your laptop and board as we will have an interactive live demo.

  Will we be told who they are before discussion? Is there going to be something due in the next week or week and a half? I just want to make sure that if I need to be doing work with a partner before my discussion on Friday, I know about it ðŸ˜› .

  How do we know which section to attend, since lab partners are randomly assigned based on this post #65 ?

  We have changed to assigning partners based on discussion section. Sorry for the confusion.
