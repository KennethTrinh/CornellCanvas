  For the polling, when we are checking the  PIT TFLG, do we check if the value is equal to 1 or some other value? Then we toggle the LED?

  You can find the answer to this in the documentation on pages 593-594 or in the discussion slides from last week. Additionally, this week's discussion slides how to do polling (but with a switch). Let me know if you're having problems finding it or have more questions

  Yeah, I think the documentation was confusing me because the 31st bit is a 1 but the way they ordered the bits from left to right, they started at 0.
