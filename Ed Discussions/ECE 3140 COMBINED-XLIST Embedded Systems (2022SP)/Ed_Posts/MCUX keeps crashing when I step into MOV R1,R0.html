  I'm trying to write the fibonacci function for the lab and it works fine when I click resume (albeit the numbers are slightly off). When I try to debug this issue with the calculations, MCUX crashes every time I step into the MOV R1,R0 command.

  I had problems with the debugger crashing on certain instructions too. Maybe try setting a breakpoint after the instruction and "resume" the debugger to that point.
