 The demo only does it for GPIO, I cannot find the bit we are supposed to set to 1 in order to clear for the PIT. I control f'd the pdf and the MKL46Z4.h and found no line of code where "PIT" and "ISF" both occur. Hello what is it called. Where am I supposed to set the bit. Where am I supposed to set the bit. Answer quickly, hurry, monster from underneath my bed is chasing me. If its in the pdf what page is it on. Please tell me. PLease hurry. quickly.
