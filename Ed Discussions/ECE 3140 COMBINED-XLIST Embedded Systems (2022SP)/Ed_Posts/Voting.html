  We assigned everyone teams to vote on so that we get a good distribution of votes. Originally voting was part of the project, but on reflection it is not fair to make anything required after the last day of finals. Several students have already left campus etc.  The points for voting will be treated as extra credit and added to your score after all the other grading / curving is done.

  There are a bunch of cool projects! The winners will be announced on Thursday, so you need to vote before then in order to have your vote count.
