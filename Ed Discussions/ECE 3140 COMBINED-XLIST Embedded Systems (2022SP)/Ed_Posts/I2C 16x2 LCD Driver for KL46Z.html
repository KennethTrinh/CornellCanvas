 Are there any board-compatible I2C drivers for a 16x2 LCD? We're looking to use a 16x2 LCD display (HD44780 compliant) to display multiple digits.

 It seems that there is a lot of I2C documentation for the LiquidCrystal_I2C library on Arduino but it's very hard to find something similar for the KL46Z.

  It is extremely unlikely that you will find a software package to help you drive an LCD display since we are running on bare metal with very little support. If you want to use a display, your best bet is to write your own driver. (I had to write my own SPI driver for a ST7735R based display when I did my final project). You can always reverse engineering the Arduino library and adapt its digital communications to your I2C setup.
