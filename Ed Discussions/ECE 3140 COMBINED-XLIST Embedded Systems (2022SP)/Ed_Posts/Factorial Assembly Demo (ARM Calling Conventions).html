 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 I just published a video on Canvas in the Discussion Sections folder going through a demo of the ARM calling conventions. In the video I use a factorial function to highlight why we need the ARM calling convention and demonstrate two ways to properly implement it. I highly recommend watching it when you get a chance and going through the example on your own board to learn more about the calling conventions and how to properly debug code.
</p>
<p>
 I hope you find this useful for Lab 1!
</p>
<p>
 Aaron

  This video was absolutely revolutionary to my learning experience. Previously, I had no clue what calling conventions meant in practice and felt completely lost on how to start the assignment. With this video, I've just completed the lab without having to wait in office hours. I would give this video five stars on Yelp if I could. Thanks very much for making this!

    I am trying to access this video and it says I do not have permission. Could you fix this? Thanks!

     I double checked with another Cornell student's account and I could see the video. Are you using your Cornell account? You'll need to use the SSO login option
