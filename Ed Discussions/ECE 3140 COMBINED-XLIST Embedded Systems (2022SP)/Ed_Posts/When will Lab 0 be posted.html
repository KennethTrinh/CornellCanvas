 I was trying to access Lab 0, but canvas says  "This assignment is part of an unpublished module and is not available yet." I was wondering when we will be allowed to access it.

  I'll try to get that up today. If you want to get started, you need to install the MCUXpresso-IDE. Lab 0 is will go over some of the specific settings for the board.

  Here is the link from NXP.
