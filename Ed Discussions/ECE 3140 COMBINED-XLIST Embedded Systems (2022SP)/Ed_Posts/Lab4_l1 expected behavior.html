  Hi! This question was asked three days ago with no response, but would someone be able to help me understand the expected functionality of lab4_l1? My processor toggles the red LED twice and then toggles the green LED 10 times, but I am unsure if that is the expected functionality. I am wondering if this process should then repeat since there are other processes queued after it.

  I would advise you to watch lecture 9.1 and then try again to read through and understand the functionality of
  <code>
   lab4_l1.c
  </code>
  . Feel free to reply or make a new post if you still are having trouble.
