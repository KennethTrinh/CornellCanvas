  It says "Describe how non-realtime and realtime processes interact." , but I don't think this is covered in the 11.1 and 11.2 lectures. Also, what does "How will you implement the behavior of no available non-RT processes and an RT process that has not yet started? " mean?

  "Implement a real-time scheduling queue that has higher priority than the normal queue used for ordinary concurrent processes."

  2) They want you to think about the case where there are no processes ready to be scheduled.
