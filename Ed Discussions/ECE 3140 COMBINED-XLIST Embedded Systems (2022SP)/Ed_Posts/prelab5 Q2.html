 It says "Describe how non-realtime and realtime processes interact." , but I don't think this is covered in the 11.1 and 11.2 lectures. Also, what does "How will you implement the behavior of no available non-RT processes and an RT process that has not yet started? " mean?

  1) It is not, but you should be able to determine this from the task in Part 2 of the lab handout:
  <break>
  </break>
  "Implement a real-time scheduling queue that has higher priority than the normal queue used for ordinary concurrent processes."
 </p>
 <p>
  2) They want you to think about the case where there are no processes ready to be scheduled.
