 Hi, it seems that the video for Lecture 9.1 cannot be played on Panopto. Is there some other way to access the recording? How will participation be calculated for this lecture?
</p>
<p>
 The other lectures appear to be working fine. Thanks!

  Just for reference, I'm accessing the site right now, and I have no issue with playing this lecture. Maybe fuss around with your browser (refresh, relaunch, re-sign-in to Panopto) and see if it's anything on your end?

   Yeah, I tried it out but unfortunately can't get 9.1 to play still :/ Like the slides are visible but there's no video/audio playback.

   Thanks for the suggestion though!

    Are you looking at
    <a href="https://cornell.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=2b114d57-ec23-409a-b8ab-ae6600fdd453">

    ? I can reproduce this issue when I access the recording through the video shown on the page in Modules instead of the Panopto Recordings section. You could also hit 'Close' at the upper right of the slides on that page.

     Hmm... I don't know why it picks the wrong default stream.  The video should show up if you press the "x" button and close the PDF slides in the module. Accessing 9.1 through the panopto interface as suggested above should also work.
