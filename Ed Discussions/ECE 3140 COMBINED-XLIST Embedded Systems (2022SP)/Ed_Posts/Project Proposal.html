 I have submitted a project proposal for my team. However, I did not save a copy of what I wrote before I submitted the proposal (I was typing directly into the Canvas assignment).
</p>
<p>
 I was wondering whether the course staff could unmute the responses made to this assignment or simply structure this Canvas assignment like the pre-labs where all responses are still visible even after submission.
</p>
<p>
 Thank you for your help.
