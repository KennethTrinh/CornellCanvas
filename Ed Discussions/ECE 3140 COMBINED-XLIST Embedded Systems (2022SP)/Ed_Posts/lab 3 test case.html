 When there is only one call to process_create() using a function p1, its expected behavior is should be the same as a normal function call without using concurrency right? Is there any additional thing we need to check in this test case?

  For a single process_create() call that would mean that there is only one process. What would the queue look like in that case? Look at your logic and try to trace what might happen with only the one process. I can't tell you what the expected behavior is, but there is a slight difference from when there is no concurrency, what is it?
