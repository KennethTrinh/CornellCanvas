 The Spring Prelim schedule found on the University Registrar
 <a href="https://registrar.cornell.edu/exams/spring-prelim-schedule">
  website
 </a>
 states that there are 2 prelims for ECE 3140.
</p>
<p>
 However, the class syllabus does not include any scheduled prelims. Could we clarify if there will be prelims for this class? Thank you!

   Correct. No exams. We had originally scheduled prelims, which is whey they still show up on the official Registrar information. But we need to decide those logistics way in advance and before Omicron. With some uncertainty of how well the in-person instruction will work, and what fraction of students might need to isolate, we decided against doing exams.
