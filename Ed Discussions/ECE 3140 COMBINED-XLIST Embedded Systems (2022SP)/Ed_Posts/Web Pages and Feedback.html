  Hi Everyone,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  We generated the webpages for all the teams that filled out the proposal form and left feedback on them. If you log into
  <link href="https://github.coecis.cornell.edu"/>
  https://github.coecis.cornell.edu as your user you should see it as one of your repos now. The repos are all part of the ece3140-sp22 organization, so the link (for a two person team) of repo once you are logged in should be:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/netid-netid
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  where the NetIDs are in alphabetical order. One and three person teams follow the same pattern.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Each repo has two branches:
 </paragraph>
 <list style="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    main: We uploaded the proposal there and left comments, you can edit this and use it for your project code
    <break>
    </break>
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    gh-pages. This branch is for your project website. You can use the page-generator from github to make you webpage, or use some sort of other mechanism to generate the page an upload here. It's up to you, but we do want you page to be hosted here.
    <break>
    </break>
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
 </list>
 <paragraph>
  The README.md file in main has some instructions on how to find your page. We left comments on most of the projects and will finish the rest later today. Please send us a private message if it does not show up by the end of today. There are a lot of really fun ideas, and we are looking forward to seeing them in action!
