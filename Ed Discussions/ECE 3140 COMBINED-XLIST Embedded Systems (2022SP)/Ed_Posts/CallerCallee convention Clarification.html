  I watched the factorial video, and I have read the other ED questions regarding this. I am still confused on a couple points. I have been told by a couple TAs that we shouldn't modify the values of R0-R3 within a function in order to respect the Caller/Callee convention. However, from my understanding, these registers are caller saved, meaning that the callee should be free to modify them as it sees fit.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  One particular case is a function (say f1) that calls another function (say f2). If f2 expects an argument in R0-R3, then f1 must necessarily change the values of R0-R3 so it can pass the arguments to f2. But if f1 is restricted to only R4 and up, there's no possible way it could do that.

  Can somebody clear up my misunderstanding?

  Not sure what you mean "we shouldn't modify the values of R0-R3 within a function". Functions are expected to modify e.g. R0 for the output.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  From what I understand, R0-R3 are caller-saved, meaning the caller has to save those registers and cannot expect the callee to keep them the same. The callee can do whatever it wants with R0-R3, including using them as local variables. The important thing is if you are using values in R0-R3 and call a function, you have to push R0-R3 onto the stack beforehand because there is no guarantee the callee will preserve them.

  If they only use R0-R3 in f2 as described above and not in another function after execution of f1-&gt;f2, then I thought R0-R3 doesn't have to be saved/preserved. Is that wrong?

  I meant if you are in a function and call another function (f1 calls f2). f1 might be using R0-R3 for a bunch of things, and the call to f2 has no guarantee of preserving them. In this case, you save on the stack.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If f2 itself does not call any other function (f2 only acts as a callee), then it does not have to save R0-R3.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The case you are describing is f1 -&gt; f2 and f2 is the only one that uses R0-R3. Here, there is no reason to save R0-R3 in either function. You should save them as needed, and since no one is using R0-R3 AND is at risk of losing their values, no one needs to save.
