  Another student had a similar error, and I think it might have been a problem with how the project was created. Could you try to first create a project for the FRDM46z and then see if the default files compile? If they do, then try to switch them out for the lab0.s file.

  You should create a "New C\C++ Project".

   In the source folder, make sure you delete any of the .c files that are auto-generated by the project.

    I have done this; only the lab0.s and original project file remain. But the error is still there.
