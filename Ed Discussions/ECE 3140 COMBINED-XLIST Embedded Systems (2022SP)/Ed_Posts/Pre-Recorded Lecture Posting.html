 Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe in class that it was mentioned that the pre-recorded lectures for the week would be posted on the Monday of that week. If this is currently the plan, I was wondering if they could maybe be released the Friday or Saturday before the week instead. That way, if we happen to have time on weekends, we can use it to get ahead on the material, and for those who would rather not they can just wait until the Monday. If I misunderstood, then that's my bad; I just think it would be helpful to have additional time to view them.

  Ok. That is a fair point and good a idea.

  I still need to finish up the recordings for next week. But after that I can try to post them earlier so you have at least part of the weekend.
