 When executing programs on the KL46Z, what's the best way to end the program (assuming it does not terminate on its own)? Is disconnecting the board from the computer a safe way to halt program execution?

  There are no issues with turning off the power or resetting the board, as there would be with a desktop. Feel free to do that for stopping execution.

  When the debugger is still responding you can also press the "stop" button.
