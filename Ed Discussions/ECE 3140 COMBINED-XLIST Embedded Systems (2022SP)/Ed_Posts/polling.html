 When polling, do we need to configure NVIC and write an ISR, or are those steps only for interrupts?

  Those steps are only for when you're implementing interrupts. Configuring the NVIC allows the interrupt to actually trigger. And if you were to have an interrupt then you would need to write the handler for the interrupt, i.e. the ISR. If you're just doing polling though then that's not necessary
