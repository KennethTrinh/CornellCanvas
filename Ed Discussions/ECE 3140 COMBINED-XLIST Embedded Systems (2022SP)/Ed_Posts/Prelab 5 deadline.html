  Hi, looks like prelab 5 depends on next week's lecture but is due next Tuesday. Can the deadline be pushed back so we can finish learning the contents before working on it?

  This! I realize that prelabs don't need to be correct but I don't have background information or context for any of the questions being asked :(.

  We will be releasing the next set of lectures shorty and will adjust the deadlines accordingly.

  I was under the impression that the deadline would change, but as that deadline passed Monday night and nothing was annouced prior, I do not believe it did.

  I believe lab 5 is due Monday and you can submit till two days later using slip days.
