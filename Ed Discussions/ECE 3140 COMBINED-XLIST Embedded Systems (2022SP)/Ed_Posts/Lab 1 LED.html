 I'm confused about which LED to use in Lab1. The handout states to use the red LED, but I've just been using the LEDON and LEDOFF methods, which turns the green LED on and off.
</p>
<p>
 Do I have to worry about which port to use for the LED?

   The lab doc is wrong, we are indeed using the green LED.

   You do not need to modify the provided LED functions (LEDSETUP, LEDON, LEDOFF).
