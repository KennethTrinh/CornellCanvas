  The following is found in
  <italic>
   3140_concur.h
  </italic>
  :
 </paragraph>
 <pre>struct process_state;
typedef struct process_state process_t;
   /* opaque definition of process type; you must provide this
      implementation.
            
            To do this, write code similar to the following in your process.c:
            
            struct process_state {
                int var1;
                struct process_state* some_pointer;
            };
   */
</pre>
 <paragraph>
  As stated, you will be implementing the struct
  <italic>
   process_state
  </italic>
  in
  <italic>
   process.c
  </italic>
  .
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The fields of
  <italic>
   process_state
  </italic>
  are up to do you decide based on several factors: the implementation of your linked list, the process stack, and anything else that you may find helpful to store alongside each process.
