 My Windows computer is clearly detecting the board, everything is connected, yet the IDE does not pick up on it. What should I do?

  Have you checked if you are using the USB-B mini port with SDA printed next to it?

    Make sure the USB is fully inserted into the port on the board. Then make sure you have a project set up, as just having a .s file open is not enough. If that continues, try closing and re-opening the project (right click on project folder in MCUXpresso -&gt; Close Project).

     I think something strange was going on with the cable, I switched to a different one and it worked fine. Thanks!
