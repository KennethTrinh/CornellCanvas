 I'm trying to debug my code but the printf function doesn't print to console. How do we print to console?

  the printf's come out in a terminal window not the console one- near the console tab, switch to the terminal tab. then click "open a new terminal", choose "serial terminal" from the dropdown. the default settings are good. your prints should show in the new terminal tab. worked for me at least
