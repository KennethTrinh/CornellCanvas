  If so, how can we distinguish where an interrupt came from? Is it that we have two interrupt handlers?

  as a follow up, is the lab handout suggesting that we modify the code for
  <code>
   PIT_IRQHandler()
  </code>
  that's found in
  <code>
   3140.s
  </code>
  ?

  Yes, multiple timers can cause interrupts. Please read through 3140.s to see how the IRW handler to see how the interrupt sources are distinguished.

  You will not need to modify the provided assembly files, but you will need to implement a new C function. See #615
