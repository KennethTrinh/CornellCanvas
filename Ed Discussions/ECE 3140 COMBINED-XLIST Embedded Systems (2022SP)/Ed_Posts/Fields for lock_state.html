 We were confused with what should be the fields of lock_state. We have an unsigned int to represent if it is locked (1) or unlocked (0). But should we also have a field for struct process_state so we know what process is being locked? Is there anything else we should be considering?

  Hint: save some information into the current_process data structure before calling process_blocked()
