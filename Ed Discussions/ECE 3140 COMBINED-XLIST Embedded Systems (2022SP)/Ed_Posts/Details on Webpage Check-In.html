  The only information provided about the webpage check-in is this
 </paragraph>
 <blockquote>
  check that you made page and give short progress report
 </blockquote>
 <paragraph>
  The webpage is already made for us, so that part's trivial. I'm assuming this progress report should be put on the webpage itself? Does our project code need to be on Github at that point? Also, when is the check? Do we have until 11:59 on Tuesday to create the progress report and push it to Git? Is there a requirement of about how much progress we need to have made? Thanks.
