  Should we be aiming to switch out RT processes in the millisecond interrupt?

 <paragraph>
  To my understanding, this would give allow the RT processes to start on time more accurately. Since process_select is only called when PIT Channel 0 generates interrupts, if we do RT switching in process_select, it may only occur after the time has incremented past the start time.

  Nope - this would cause the context switches to take up a significant amount of time

  While you are correct, we would then be adding a lengthy process to our global timer which would offset our timing. Also if we did that, there would be no point to using two district timers.
