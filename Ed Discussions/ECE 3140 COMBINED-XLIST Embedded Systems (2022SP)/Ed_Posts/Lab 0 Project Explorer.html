 On step 3 in lab 0, I am told to find my new project in the project explorer. However, I cannot find the project explorer. Are there office hours for issues with lab 0?

  Project explorer should be the icon on the left sidebar that looks like a text document with a folder in front of it. I think you can also access it from the top menu bar by going to window -&gt; show view -&gt; project explorer.

  I'm not sure if it's the same across all platforms though (I'm using a macbook).
