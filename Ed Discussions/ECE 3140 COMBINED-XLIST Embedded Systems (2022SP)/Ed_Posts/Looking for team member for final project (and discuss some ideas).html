  Looking for a team member for the final project and discuss potential ideas for the project proposal. Some of the ideas I'm thinking of are: detecting errors when playing an instrument, stats and crash detection for cycling, password protected lock using a keyboard/keypad peripheral. You can reach me at vs339@cornell.edu!
