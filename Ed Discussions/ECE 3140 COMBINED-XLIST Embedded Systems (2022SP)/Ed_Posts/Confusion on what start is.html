 The discussion slides say that start is an absolute time. If start were an absolute time, wouldn't a process only be ready when current_time is later than start?

 The lab handout implies that start is relative to current_time.

  The wording in this slide is a little confusing. Say your start time is 1 second, the process would not be ready if the current time was 0.5 sec.  But if current time is &gt;= 1sec then the process is ready and could actually begin processing any time (not necessarily at 1 second).

   There is no contradiction.
   <code>
    start
   </code>
   is always a measure of absolute time (which is expressed by the first image and the first line of the second image).
   <code>
    deadline
   </code>
   is a measure of relative time with respect to
   <code>
    start
   </code>
   .
   <break>
   </break>
   <break>
   </break>
   If a process is created using
   <code>
    {1000, 500}
   </code>
   , it starts at 1 second and has relative deadline of 0.5 seconds after it starts. This means its deadline (in absolute time) is at 1.5 seconds.
  </p>
  <p>
   The wording about being relative to
   <code>
    start
   </code>
   and not
   <code>
    current_time
   </code>
   means that if your scheduler does not actually begin running this process until 1.25 seconds, its deadline would still be at 1.5 seconds and not at 1.75 seconds.
