  The discussion slides say that start is an absolute time. If start were an absolute time, wouldn't a process only be ready when current_time is later than start?

  The lab handout implies that start is relative to current_time.

  There is no contradiction.
  <code>
   start
  </code>
  is always a measure of absolute time (which is expressed by the first image and the first line of the second image).
  <code>
   deadline
  </code>
  is a measure of relative time with respect to
  <code>
   start
  </code>
  .

  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  If a process is created using
  <code>
   {1000, 500}
  </code>
  , it starts at 1 second and has relative deadline of 0.5 seconds after it starts. This means its deadline (in absolute time) is at 1.5 seconds.

 <paragraph>
  The wording about being relative to
  <code>
   start
  </code>
  and not
  <code>
   current_time
  </code>
  means that if your scheduler does not actually begin running this process until 1.25 seconds, its deadline would still be at 1.5 seconds and not at 1.75 seconds.

  The wording in this slide is a little confusing. Say your start time is 1 second, the process would not be ready if the current time was 0.5 sec.  But if current time is &gt;= 1sec then the process is ready and could actually begin processing any time (not necessarily at 1 second).
