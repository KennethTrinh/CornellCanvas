  Hi all,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  We've had several questions from students who think the debugger is stuck when implementing polling so I wanted to post this to help others. Consider the following lines of code with an infinite loop with an if statement inside (as is the case from the switch demo):
 </paragraph>

 <paragraph>
  When you run this with the debug and hit the step over or step into buttons it will appear that nothing is happening.
  <underline>
   In reality though, it's executing the if statement, determining that it's false, and then since it's in an infinite loop it goes back to the same line
  </underline>
  . This is expected behavior (as long as the if statement is false).
 </paragraph>

  I hope this helps!
