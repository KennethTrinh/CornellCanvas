 Hi all,
</p>
<p>
 We've had several questions from students who think the debugger is stuck when implementing polling so I wanted to post this to help others. Consider the following lines of code with an infinite loop with an if statement inside (as is the case from the switch demo):
</p>

</figure>
<p>
 When you run this with the debug and hit the step over or step into buttons it will appear that nothing is happening.
 <underline>
  In reality though, it's executing the if statement, determining that it's false, and then since it's in an infinite loop it goes back to the same line
 </underline>
 . This is expected behavior (as long as the if statement is false).
</p>
<p>
 I hope this helps!
</p>
