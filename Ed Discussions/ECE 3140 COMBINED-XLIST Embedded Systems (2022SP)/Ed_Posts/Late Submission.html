 I know that the syllabus says that we have two slip days to use for the first two labs, but on cmsx it says that it allows late submission until today at 3pm. When looking over my code just now I realized I have a one line mistake on one of my functions, and I am wondering if I can still resubmit something today and still having it be within the two slip days limit.

  I would assume that this is outside of the two slip day deadline. If it's only a one line mistake, it should not have too much of an impact on your grade.
