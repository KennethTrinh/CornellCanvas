  Is there an easy way of figuring out what files are different or new from the SDK examples? I am trying to add the bubble example code to my final project, but I cannot get it to work after I transferred all the new files. It seems like even when files have the same name, they have different content. Any help?

  I'm not sure this is relevant, but two files can be compared by running
  <code>
   diff &lt;file1&gt; &lt;file2&gt;
  </code>
  on most Unix-style command lines.
