  Hi, I tried running the debugger this morning, but it says no probes available when I try to debug as PEMicro Probes. I'm not sure if this is because I'm using a Mac since I have the board plugged in, but it's still giving me this error. Thanks!

  There is sometimes a bug with MCUXpresso where this can happen. Unplug and replug the board, if that doesn't work restart MCUXpresso and if that still doesn't work then restart your computer. Usually one of these fixes the problem
