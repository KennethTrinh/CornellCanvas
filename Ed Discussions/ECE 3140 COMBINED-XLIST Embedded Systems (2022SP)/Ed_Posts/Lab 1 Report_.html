  How should we represent the stack during the recursive call on fib? Do we need to show what elements are in the stack at every stage in the program?

  I'm just a little confused as to the "Design" requirement in the report.

  We are looking for a clear description of the different activation records of the recursive fib call. It would be helpful to put in some actual values for the stored registers to show how fib is working on different call levels. You can show the recursive call to fib (3) or fib(4), and discuss how this can be generalized to other cases.
