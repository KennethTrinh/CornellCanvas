 How could we divide a value by another and save both the quotient and remainder? For example, if we want to divide the value stored in R0 by 10 and store the remainder in R1 and store the quotient in R0, how can we achieve this?

  The ARMv6-M ISA does not have a DIV instruction, so you'll have to be clever about how you figure this out! :)

  The extra credit is designed to be a bit more challenging so you may have to think about this for a while. A tip I'll give you is how would you divide one number by another by hand?
