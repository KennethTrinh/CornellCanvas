 Since the content of the demo isn't specified, can we get points off for not including something? Or is it just meant to demonstrate the code? I'm worried our demo isn't detailed enough.

    The rubric stated in the other comment is ridiculous, we made a short video literally demo-ing our project. It is a short video showing how our project works but in no way encompasses all the details as mentioned. Myself and both my partners have already left campus, unless an extension is given, we will be uploading our video as is and do not expect it to be graded under this rubric.

     Even an extension has issues - the finals period ends tomorrow morning, and many people have commitments or only short periods of time to spend with their families before summer jobs.

      Also I was unaware that a schematic and block diagram were necessary until 2 hours before the deadline. I will also assume I will be held do the standard that I was aware of.

     This is way to late to complete the video and block diagram.

     </p>
     <p>
      <break>
      </break>
      - Describes briefly what their system does

     </p>
     <p>
      <break>
      </break>
      - Give a brief overview of the project.
     </p>
     <p>
      <break>
      </break>
      - Show the system working.
     </p>
     <p>
      <break>
      </break>
      - Describe some of the technical details.
     </p>
     <p>
      <break>
      </break>
      - What would be the most interesting piece of information for your fellow students?
     </p>
     <p>
      <break>
      </break>
      - Was there a super tricky bug?
     </p>
     <p>
      <break>
      </break>
      - Something surprising you learned during the implementation?
     </p>
     <p>
      <break>
      </break>
      - Did you come up with some supre clever tests?
     </p>
     <p>
      <break>
      </break>
      System diagram
     </p>
     <p>
      <break>
      </break>
      - Includes block diagram of system showing how components interact. This diagram could potentially be replaced by very clear writing
      <break>
      </break>
      System description
     </p>
     <p>
      <break>
      </break>
      - Explains how their system/software works
     </p>
     <p>
      <break>
      </break>
      - Should be at an appropriate level of detail to allow you to evaluate their design decisions
     </p>
     <p>
      <break>
      </break>
      - Projects with additional hardware must include a schematic
     </p>
     <p>
      <break>
      </break>
      Testing
     </p>
     <p>

     </p>
     <p>
      <break>
      </break>
      - Some projects may not have traditional test cases (e.g. tested the system by human interaction with it), but all projects must be tested
