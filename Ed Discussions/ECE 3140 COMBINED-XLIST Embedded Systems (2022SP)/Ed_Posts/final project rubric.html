  Would it be possible to repost last year's lab manual for the final project. I know some of the material on the reference sheet won't be relevant, but my group wanted to get started over spring break.

  For the final project we ask you to implement an embedded system of your choice.

  The logistics for this final portion of the class will be somewhat different. We won't have any new (required) material or quizzes so you can focus on the project and your other classes. I will still post lectures about some extra topics that I would like to cover, or specific questions that you might have and want to hear more about.

  The main output will be a webpage and a short video.

  You have to use the board from class in some significant way, but you can network it or interface it to other devices or boards. For the final competition, there will be two categories: projects without any additional hardware, and projects that use additional components. That way you have a fair shot at winning even if you don't have an electronics shop at home or access to fancy components.

  MCUXpresso has code examples for most of it's peripheral devices and you are welcome to use them in your project. For example, if you want to use your computer figuring out how to use the serial port over USB might be helpful.

  We will try to give you quick feedback on your project proposal and indicate whether or not it fits the project parameters and if we foresee any implementation issues. We'll also try to give you pointers on how to go about some technical issues we foresee. If you have a specific question on how feasible something is, you can put it in your project proposal form. If you submit the form early, we will start giving feedback before the due date.

  Good luck!
