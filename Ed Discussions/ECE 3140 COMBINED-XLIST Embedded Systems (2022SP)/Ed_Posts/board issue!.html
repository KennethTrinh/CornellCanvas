 My board doesn't seem to show up on my computer of MCUEXPRESSO even though it's worked earlier.

 It will blink the green LED a few times (old code?) and then just stop

  Are you plugged into the correct USB port (OpenSDA)? Have you tried a different USB port or a different dongle / adaptor? Have you tried using your partner's board?
