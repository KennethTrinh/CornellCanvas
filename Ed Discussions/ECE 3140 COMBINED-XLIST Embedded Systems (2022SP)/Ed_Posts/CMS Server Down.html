 Hello, I am trying to submit my lab1 files on CMS, but it says that the server is currently unavailable. What should I do? Will it be fixed before midnight?

  Update: I was able to upload my files successfully when I switched the UI to CMSX Classic; it's under the View menu on the upper right corner, in case if anyone is having the same problem.
