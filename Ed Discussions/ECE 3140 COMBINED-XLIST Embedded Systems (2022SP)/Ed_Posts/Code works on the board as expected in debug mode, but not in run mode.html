 EDIT: Resolved

<p>
 Is there a difference in how the timer works in GUI flash mode vs debug mode? When I'm stepping through steps in debug mode, my leds on the board flash and toggle as expected.
</p>
<p>
 The program behaves differently (as if the timer never runs) when I use GUI flash.
</p>
<p>
 Any ideas?
