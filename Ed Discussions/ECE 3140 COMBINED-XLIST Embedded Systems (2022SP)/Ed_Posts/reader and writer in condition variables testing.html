  Readers and writers are higher level constructs that will be discussed in the next set of lectures (9.1 or 9.2).

 <paragraph>
  A reader is a process that reads a shared resource and a writer is a process that modifies a shared resource. While processes can do either, we need to ensure that no process accesses the shared resource (read OR write) while another process is in the process of writing to it.

  Readers and writers probably will be useful for writing test cases using conditional variables.
