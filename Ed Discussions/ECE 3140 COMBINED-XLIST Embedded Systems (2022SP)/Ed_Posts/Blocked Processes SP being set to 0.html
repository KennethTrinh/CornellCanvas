 I am not sure if this is expected behavior or not, but my stack pointer of my blocked processes is being set to 0. It seems like it is doing this after running process_blocked(). Is this supposed to happen?

  Yeah that seems very strange...if you clear the stack pointer you will be unable to run that processes ever again...
