 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 Everything I hammer the file, usually the chip is clickable so I can run it on the board to test. But sometimes it would be like this (the photo) and I can't click it and would need to restart the program. Is there a reason for that or how would I fix it? Thank you!

  Unfortunately, this a pretty common issue with no proper solution. Usually it will show up if you unplug and plug it back in or re-open and close the debugger.

   Ah, I see. Thank you! Also, do I have to hammer the file every time I make changes?
