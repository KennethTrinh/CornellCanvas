 When I run my code using debugger, it compiles and works as expected. When I press the chip button, the code compiles and works as excepted. But when I run the code using the green play button, I get an error that says 'Launching lab1.axf has encounter a problem. Error starting process.' What is causing this error? I have tried pressing the build button first (hammer icon) and reseting the board manually (reset button on the board).

  Are you trying to "RUN" the code or enter the debugger. There are two "play" looking buttons. Please follow the instructions in Lab 0.

  The RUN button does not work, since it will try to run the binary on your computer. Actually, it could run using interworking if you have an ARM based Mac : )
