 The lab handout states that we need to include a section about Style and Clarity in our lab report. Is this required? The description of it sounds like it is based on our actual code.

  You don't need to include a 'Style and Clarity' section in your report. Read through the corresponding instructions and make sure you use good formatting, meaningful variable names, and sufficient comments in your codes.
