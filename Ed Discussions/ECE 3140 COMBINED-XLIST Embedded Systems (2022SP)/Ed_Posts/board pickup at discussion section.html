 Could I pick up a board at the end of the discussion section Wednesday since mine is not until Friday? I know in a previous Ed Post it was mentioned to come to a different recitation at the beginning but I have a class at that time. Does someone know who the TA is so I can arrange for them to save me one?

  Yes you can come at the end of a discussion to pick up a board; we will bring extra boards.
