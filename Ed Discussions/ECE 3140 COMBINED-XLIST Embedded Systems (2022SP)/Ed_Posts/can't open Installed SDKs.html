  I built and downloaded the FRDM-KL46Z from the website, but when I try to do the next step in the instructions, which is to click through "Windows" -&gt; "Show View" -&gt; "Other" -&gt; "Installed SDKs", nothing pops up to show my installed SDKs.

  Try Windows -&gt; Perspective -&gt; Reset Perspective.

  Installed SDKs should show up in a tab on the bottom task bar.

  I am currently having this issue and tried resetting the perspective before clicking Window -&gt; Show View -&gt; Installed SDKs. Nothing happens from what I can tell when I click Installed SDKs

  This is still not working for me for some reason. When I click on the frdmkl46z after going through Windows -&gt; Show View -&gt; Other -&gt; MCUXpresso IDE -&gt; Install MCUXpresso SDKs -&gt; frdmkl46z, it takes me to a website but doesn't have an option for me to install.
