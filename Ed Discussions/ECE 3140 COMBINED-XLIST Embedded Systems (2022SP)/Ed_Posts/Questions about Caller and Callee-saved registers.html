  If R4-8, (R9), R10-11 are not used by the caller, why does the callee need to save them? Is it because another function could be called from here and the callee also becomes a caller in that case?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Also if R0-3 are used by the caller, and are not used by the callee, does that mean they don't need to be caller-saved?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I know it's possible that R0 is used by the callee to store results, does that mean it needs to be caller-saved?

  I think for your first question, the caller expects R4 and beyond to remain the same before and after any function calls.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For the second question, I think it's similar in the sense that R0-R3 are essentially free reign and the callee is allowed to modify them, which is why the caller needs to save them before making the function call.

 <paragraph>
  Not sure about the last question though.
