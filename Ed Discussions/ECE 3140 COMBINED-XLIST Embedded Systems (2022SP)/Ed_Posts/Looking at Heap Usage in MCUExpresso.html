  I was trying to see whether there might be any memory leaks in my code, and so I used the debugger to look at the heap right before the program exits. However, it appears that everything that I ever allocated is still in my heap, despite me freeing things. When stepping through with debugger, it seems like my code should be freeing space correctly, so I was wondering whether this is just an IDE issue with not properly displaying that my heap has been deallocated, or whether I should continue trying to debug?

  I know this response is late, but there are two necessary
  <code>
   malloc()
  </code>
  calls in this assignment - one that you will write and one from
  <code>
   process_stack_init()
  </code>
  . Therefore, there should be two
  <code>
   free()
  </code>
  calls, one in
  <code>
   process_stack_free()
  </code>
  and one you should write. If everything you've ever malloc'd is still in the heap, it could be that you are not calling
  <code>
   free()
  </code>
  properly, or you're doing it in a piece of code that never executes, or you're missing either your
  <code>
   free()
  </code>
  or
  <code>
   process_stack_free()
  </code>
  .

  If  you've already submitted and are still worried about this, don't worry, we don't extensively test for memory leaks ;)
