 Hello!
</p>
<p>
 What does it mean by memory alignment? Professor Napps mentions "shuffling" of bits but i'm still confused.
</p>
<p>
 This is slide 14 in Lecture 2.3

  By "shuffling" I mean changing the location of bits in the word.
 </p>
 <p>
  So lets say  I read a  32-bit memory line and the bus has the value:
 </p>
 <p>
  0b 0000 0000
  <b>
   0000 1111
  </b>
  0000 0000 0000 0000
 </p>
 <p>
  or in hex
 </p>
 <p>
  0x 00
  <b>
   0F
  </b>
  0000
 </p>
 <p>
  The layout in memory would be Byte3,
  <b>
   Byte2
  </b>
  ,Byte1,Byte0.
 </p>
 <p>
  Where Byte2 = 0x0F (aka 15) and Byte3,Byte1, and Byte0 are 0x00
 </p>
 <p>
  If I wanted to read Byte 2 with LDRB, then I would need to read the word line (0x00
  <b>
   0F
  </b>
  0000) and then "shuffle" or move the bold bits to the least significant byte.  It means that for some types of memory access (the ones that are allowed by the ISA) I can read a single 32-bit line and then get the answer by just moving bits around. But for memory access that is not aligned, I would need to read two consecutive 32-bit words and get bits for each, i.e. you can't get the result by just shuffling/moving bits from a single 32-bit read instruction.
