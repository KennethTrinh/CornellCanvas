  I am not sure whether I should implement Part2 in Framework1.c or Framework2.c? It says on the lab2 instruction sheet that we are supposed to implement in Framework1.c, however on the comment section of the Framework2.c, it says "enable PIT Interrupts (for part 2)". So I am really unsure of where to implement part2.

  I have a quick follow-up quesiton: in the handout it is said that we have to use loops to toggle the red LED. Does that mean that we can just copy the code from part 2?

  You may choose to reuse parts of your polling code if you desire.
