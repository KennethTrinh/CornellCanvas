 Hi all,
</p>
<p>
 This week's discussion section will provide an introduction to soldering and discuss how to use the examples provided in the SDK. We will bring battery holders, header pins, and soldering equipment to discussion sections and lab help sections this week for groups who may want to use them for their final project.
</p>
<p>
 Best,
</p>
<p>
 Aaron
