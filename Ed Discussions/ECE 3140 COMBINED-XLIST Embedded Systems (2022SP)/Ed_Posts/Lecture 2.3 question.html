 I am really confused about how to solve this question. According to the question, each character of the string "Embedded Systems" is a single byte. In this case, when the "Embedded Systems" is stored into the memory address  3,  for the STR R4, [R3, R7] instruction, will the last 4 characters (tems) be stored into address 3 since STR stores 32-bit content? Then, for the STR R5, [R3, R7], where R5 stores "Rock!" and R7 is now 4, will the memory starting at address 3 become "temsock!"?

  Yeah, It's super confusing because as stated the questions is wrong! ... The code should take 4-bytes (characters) at a time and interleave them. However in that case the stopping condition is kind of odd. You'd need for consecutive null characters in order to stop, and the second set of 4 bytes would have three NULL characters "!,0x00,0x00,0x00". So that's not really a good C-string.

  I messed up when I re-recorded the questions, I'm really sorry for the confusion.
