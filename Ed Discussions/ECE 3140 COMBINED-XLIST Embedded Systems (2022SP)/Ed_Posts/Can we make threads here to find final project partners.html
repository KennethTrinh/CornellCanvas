 Hello, is it okay to make threads here for finding final project partners? Also, would it be okay to share tentative ideas in our post to let potential team members join an interesting project?

 Maybe a megathread created by the course staff would be helpful? I don't know many people in the class so it's hard to find a group. Would appreciate any help here!
