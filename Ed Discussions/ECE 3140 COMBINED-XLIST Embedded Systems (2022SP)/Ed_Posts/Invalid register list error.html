 I think I might have messed up the set up for my MCUXpresso but not really sure. Any insight would be great!

  Is this a compile, linking, or runtime error?

  If the error is what i think it is, I got that too, and the reason its happening is because your PUSHes and POPs are wrong somehow

    yes, but bc i dont know your specific problem(and I'm more than slightly scared of AI violations) I can't answer specifically. you can make a private post that only staff can see and share your code there. maybe they can help?
