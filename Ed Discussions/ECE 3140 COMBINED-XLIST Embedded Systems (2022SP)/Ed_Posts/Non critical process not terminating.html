 If we run 1, 2, A, B as the sequence of automatic actions, how is it possible that 2 ever gets ran after 1? If x2==0 it seems that 1 will never get terminated.

  1) Just because something never terminates doesn't mean that other actions can't be run in parallel (think back to Lab 2 - if you had an un-terminated process, other processes could still run in parallel with it)
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  2) If x
  <sub>
   2
  </sub>
  is 0, then Step #1 will terminate immediately (as the while loop will see 0 and immediately terminate)
