  For the case that there are no NRT processes and all RT processes are unready, what should process_select return? Should it enter a while loop and wait for one of the unready processes to become ready? If that is right, then will the channel 1 PIT interrupt the channel 0 PIT and increment the current time? If not, how do we configure the priorities so that this happens; we are not sure since they both use the same handler.

  #630, and just as you use
  <code>
   NVIC_EnableIRQ
  </code>
  to enable the source, there also exists
  <code>
   NVIC_SetPriority
  </code>
  which allows you to configured priorities for
  <code>
   PIT_IRQn
  </code>
  and
  <code>
   SVCall_IRQn
  </code>
  (see discussion slides).

  EDIT: It will just be easier for you to poll the PIT1 flag instead of dealing with the caveats brought up by this method.

  I see. I am having trouble finding in the reference manual what are the PIT_IRQns of channel 0 and 1. Would something like NVIC_SetPriority(0, 4) set channel 0's priority to 4?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Also, what do we have to do with the SVC? Would that need to interrupt while waiting?

  When it came to the busy waiting situation, changing the interrupt priority wasn't really doing anything for me. I just ended up doing polling for when the second PIT channel hit its mark (review lab 2 for reference) and then I incremented the current time accordingly. I put that polling in the while loop that busy waits until the current time reaches the start time of the next unready realtime process. I mean since we are busy waiting already polling won't really destroy performance. I could be wrong though so please feel free to correct me TAs.

  With polling, we have to set the TIE bit of PIT 1's TCTRL (i.e. set TCTRL = 3) while waiting inside process_select, right?  I'm pretty sure it is needed to check the TFLG.

  Also, this won't cause the assembly PIT handler to rerun on each interrupt, right?

  I don't think you do. I thought that was for enabling interrupts, but the timer will still run without interrupts enabled (see
  <link href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/19442/discussion/1426192"/>
  #638) so you'll still be able to check if TFLG is 1 in order to know when to increment the current_time. You just need to remember to clear TFLG everytime after you increment the current_time like you do in your
  <code>
   PIT1_Service()
  </code>
  function.

  Oh ok. I didn't know we had to clear TFLG in the PIT1 handler, but now I see the assembly only does it for PIT0. Thanks for the help!
