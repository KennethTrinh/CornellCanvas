 When testing, if I set breakpoints somewhere and try to step to the next line, IDE will say "not all breakpoints can be reached, do you want to continue?".
</p>
<p>
 If I click "continue", it will jump to some weird place rather than the next line.
</p>
<p>
 If I click "not", it will go into assembly code which is not what I want.
</p>
<p>
 It makes debugging way more difficult. Can anyone explain it? Thank you very much!

  I think it has to do with the free version of the IDE only allowing 2 (or some other limited number) of breakpoints to actually work
