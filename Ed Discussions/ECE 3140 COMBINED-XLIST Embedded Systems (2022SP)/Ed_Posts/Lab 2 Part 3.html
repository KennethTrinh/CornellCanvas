  Is there a part 3 file we need to submit for this lab? There is a part 3 on the lab handout, but I'm not sure what we need to submit for it since the only files we're expected to submit are: LED.c, part1.c, and part2.c.

  I noticed that the "LED.c" file is the real work that we need to submit for part 1 in the lab manual directions. With that in mind, they could mean that (for turning in files) "part1.c" corresponds to the file based on "Framework1.c" (from the part 2 section in the directions) and that "part2.c" (from the part 3 section in the directions) corresponds to the file based on "Framework2.c". I could be totally wrong though so I'll probably ask a TA during discussion.
