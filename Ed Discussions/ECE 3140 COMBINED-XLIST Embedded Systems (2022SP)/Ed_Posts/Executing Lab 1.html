  Flashing your board is covered in section 5.1 of the lab0 handout.

  I did that, but do can you only step through your program with the debugger, or is there a way to run the full thing?

  When you flash your code, your program will automatically start running when it is plugged in or the reset button is pressed. If you want to do the same thing with more steps, you can open the debugger and hit the left most 'play' button. Step-by-step (and later on we will get into breakpoints) requires the debugger to be active.
