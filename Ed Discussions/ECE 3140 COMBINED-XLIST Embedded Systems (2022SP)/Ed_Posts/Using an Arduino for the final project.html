 Are we allowed to use other devices such as an Arduino (and other embedded components) for the final project? And if so, are we expected to purchase those ourselves or will we have some way of accessing materials through Cornell?

  You may use additional hardware such as Arduinos in your final project, but only the code for the KL46Z will be graded. While there is a possibility that we may offer some pin headers and soldering supplies so that students can attach components to your boards through jumpers and not by directly soldering to the board, we do not supply any additional hardware.
