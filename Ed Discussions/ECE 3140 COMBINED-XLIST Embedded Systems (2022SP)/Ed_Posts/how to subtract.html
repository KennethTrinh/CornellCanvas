 hi, i am trying to use the following code to do 5-(input number) and then blink that many dashes but it does the dot sequence then blinks 5 dashes (should do 2) and then hard faults. am i not subtracting correctly?

  It looks like you are doing a nested function call, so you should PUSH {LR} before anything. Also, does the call to flash_n_dots affect R1? If it does, you have to save it on the stack.
 </p>
 <p>
  Also, which register does flash_n_dashes expect the input value in? Right now it looks like it is R2, is that right?

   yes, R2 is right. and pushing LR fixed the fault, but it only flashes 2 dashes no matter my R0 input now

    Did you save R1 on the stack before calling flash_n_dots? I suspect that value is getting overwritten.

      Not sure then. I would try looking step by step with the debugger to see where those 2 dashes are coming from.

       ok it seems like when i pop R1 back off the stack it always fills in as a 3 even when it started as a 2, for example. any idea why that would be?

        Unless your stack pointer changes after the function call, there is no way the value can change when you pop it off. That number is changing somewhere.
