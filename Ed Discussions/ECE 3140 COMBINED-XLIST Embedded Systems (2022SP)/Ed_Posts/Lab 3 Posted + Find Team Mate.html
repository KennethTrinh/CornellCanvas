  Hi Everyone,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If you already had discussion section this week you hopefully met your new team mate. The teams should be visible both on Canvas and on CMS for Lab 3. On Canvas you can only see your team mate's name, but CMS should also show the NetID, which should make e-mailing easier.
