  Lecture 2.3 mentions that the ARM memory organization typically has a 4 GB addressing space corresponding to 32-bit addresses.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  However, the Thumb ISA is generally composed of 16-bit instructions - thus, how are we able to load from a 32-bit memory address using the ISA?

  You would be write that we are unable to just go ahead and write something like the following due to the lack of available bits when encoding the instruction
  <code>
   LDR R5, #0x40048038
  </code>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Let's take a look at 16-bit Thumb encoding of
  <italic>
   LDR (literal)
  </italic>
  from the ARMv6-M Architecture Reference Manual:

  In our programs, we will usually set up constants for the addresses we want to access. This is done using the
  <code>
   .equ
  </code>
  directive. For example, let us write
  <code>
   .equ SCGC5, 0x40048038
  </code>
  While this does give us a
  <italic>
   'label'
  </italic>
  and help us organize our code, our assembler actually sets up a location in program memory where this value is stored.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If we were to put this line in our program, built it, and then disassembly the output, you would notice a line like
  <code>
   8c: 40048038
  </code>
  This means that at are
  <code>
   0x8c
  </code>
  in our program, there exists the word
  <code>
   0x40048038
  </code>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Now let us include the instruction
  <code>
   LDR R5, =SCGC5
  </code>
  and disassemble our output again. You would find a line similar to
  <code>
   2a: 4d18
  </code>
  which decodes to
  <code>
   ldr r5, [pc, #96]
  </code>
  which is at address
  <code>
   0x2a
  </code>
  in our program's
  <code>
   .text
  </code>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If we are running our program, and reach the instruction at
  <code>
   0x2a
  </code>
  , our program counter is
  <code>
   0x2c
  </code>
  since it holds the value of the next instruction to be fetched. Now let us evaluate that instruction:
 </paragraph>
 <pre>ldr r5, [pc, #96]
ldr r5, [#0x2c + #96]
ldr r5, [#0x8c]
</pre>
 <paragraph>
  Notice that the value at address
  <code>
   0x8c
  </code>
  will be loaded into
  <code>
   R5
  </code>
  , allowing us to access a 32-bit value by storing it in our program data
  <italic>
   at an offset relative to the program counter.
