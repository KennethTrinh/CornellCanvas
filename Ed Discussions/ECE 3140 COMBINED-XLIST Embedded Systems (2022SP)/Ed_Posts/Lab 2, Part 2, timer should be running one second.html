<p>
 The timer should count down one second (i.e., the init for the timer period should be number of cycles corresponding to one second) and then we toggle the red led once when the timer expires, right?
</p>
<p>
 With the always true condition for the while loop in polling, the toggle is being called infinitely since while is an infinite loop. Should I exit the while loop? If yes, can I use a temp variable to break me out of the while loop?
