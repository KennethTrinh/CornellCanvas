  Any hints on how to flash the green LED for approximately a tenth of a second once every second?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I implemented something, but it is not working, I can make a private post if required.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  But just wanted some advice to see if I am even on the right track
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thank you!

  Green Toggle doesn't have to happen in every interrupt handing function.

  Conditionally, you can invoke green_on with a condition inside the interrupt handing
