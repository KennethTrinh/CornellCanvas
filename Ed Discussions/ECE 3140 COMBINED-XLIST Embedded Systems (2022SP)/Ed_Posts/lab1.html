  When I downloaded the lab1 files, the extension for the lab1 assembly file was lab1.s.s. I was just wondering if this was intentional or should it have been lab1.s?

  While it should be lab1.s, you should not encounter any issues if you leave the file name as it is.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For lab submission, you will be renaming them anyways to part1.s, part2.s, and part3.s [and part3ec.s for the optional extra credit].

  So are we using the released code as a starting point fro all three parts? Is the released code only for part3?

  It will probably be beneficial to use your part1 as a basis for part2, and part2 as a basis for part3.

  Are we responsible for writing test cases? Will they be graded?

  As per the lab document:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  To test your program, call fib() from assembly language, and display the result by calling  MorseDigit(). Include your test cases in your submission. Your submission must include at least one call to each of your functions (fib and MorseDigit). All function calls must respect the ARM calling conventions.

  So just to clarify, do we just drag this file 3 different times and rename it each time? Each one should also be part of a different new project right?

  Please confirm file submission with what is asked for on CMS. I cannot see it but I believe you are just uploading the assembly files (.s) individually to each section and NOT an entire project structure.
