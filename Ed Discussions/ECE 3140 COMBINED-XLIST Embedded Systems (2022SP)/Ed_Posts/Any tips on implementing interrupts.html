  Hi, I am stuck on this part. I have looked through the slides, but I am unsure about
  <bold>
   PIT_IRQHandler
  </bold>
  (
  <bold>
   void
  </bold>
  ). I know it handles the interrupt, but I am confused on what it should do? Just clear the interrupt flag?

  Yes, it needs to clear the interrupt flag but it should also do your application specific code. For example, if we had a robot that had a sensor interrupt the execution then in the interrupt handler we might do a quick calculation and save that value somewhere. For your lab you'll need to determine what you want to do in your IRQHandler to get the appropriate behavior.

  If you haven't looked at it yet, take a look at the switch demo from this week's discussion. There's an example in the code for how to implement the handler (but for a GPIO input instead of the PIT)
