 How should we go about doing this? Should we just copy and paste the code from part 2 into the same file for part 3 and then have fib(int n) call to MorseDigit() inside of it? The separate files for each part is throwing me off a little. Thank you!

  Since you have to submit each of the three files to cms, I think each file needs to be able to run independently. So you should just copy MorseDigit() inside of the file for part 3.
