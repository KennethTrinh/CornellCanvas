 For lab1, my code indicates the LED to remain on for 0.5 second and off, but when I actually run it, there is no light. Also, when I step into each function, the LED behaves on and off just as it should be.

 Could it be a problem of board frequency that overall I am not seeing any effect?

  Do you pause for long enough? If the flash of light is too fast, it won't be visible to the human eye, making it look like the light hasn't turned on.
