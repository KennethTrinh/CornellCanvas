  The Lab 1 handout says that "We expect to be able to link this function into a C-
  <break>
  </break>
  program and call it." Do we need to add anything to our assembly program that allows this to happen (rather than just leaving it as a program that can be run directly on the board with a pre-assigned input value in R0)?
