 I just got my modules delivered, but I just missed the office hours. I don't want to wait until Monday to get the soldering done, but I am having trouble finding a location I can go. I found the MakerClub has soldering equipment, but I have to wait for a training session before I can access the space. I also saw that Mann Library's Maker Space has closed. Are there other places I can go?
