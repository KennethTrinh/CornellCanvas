  Yeah I got this warning too when trying to call a function in lock.c but it was defined in process.c, and I wasn't sure how to include the functions from the process.c file

  This happens when you try to call a function that isn't actually defined! To make sure that your file knows about the definition, make sure to include the line
  <code>
   #include "&lt;file name&gt;"
  </code>
  at the top of your file, similar to the examples from the lab handout. In effect (without getting to bogged down by pre-processor conditionals, which shouldn't be a concern), this copy-pastes the code from &lt;file name&gt; at the top of your file, so any functions that are defined in that file can be used by your code
