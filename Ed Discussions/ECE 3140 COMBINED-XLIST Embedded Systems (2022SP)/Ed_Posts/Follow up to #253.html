 How do we use the start up files (clock view perspective) mentioned in the answer of #253 to calculate what value we need to load to get the appropriate timing?

  Frequency is a measure of the number of clock cycles in one second and its units is hertz (inverse seconds). If you multiply time by frequency, your result is unitless and is the total number of cycles in that time frame.

  Ex: 0.05 seconds * 1 kHz = 50 clock cycles
