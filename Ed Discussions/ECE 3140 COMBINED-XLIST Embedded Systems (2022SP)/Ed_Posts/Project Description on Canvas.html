 I'm reading the Project Description on Canvas (from Spring 2020). It mentions that for Lab 4, we will outline some of the projects we are thinking about, which, as I understand it, refers to the Final Project. However, aren't Labs 3-5 completed by assigned groups, and we only choose partner(s) for the Final Project? If Labs 4-5 are parts of the final project, how does this partner switch work out?
</p>
<p>
 Thanks in advance.

  Please ignore that page for the time being. Labs 3-5 will be done with assigned partners and you will have the choice to pick partners for the final project. We will ask everyone to submit their proposed group and project proposal. This will occur sometime during Lab 4 or Lab 5. The final project is open-ended and you are not required to use content from those last few labs in your project, as long as you show sufficient complexity in other ways.

   Yes, sorry. There was a mistake in the canvas setting. We will give you instructions that make sense for SP22!
