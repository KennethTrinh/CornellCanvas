  , but a couple things arise:

    At least when I tried it, I got linker errors of multiple definitions (it was defining the enqueue function twice somewhere), even with pre-compiler #ifndef statements (yea, it was weird)
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    You actually want your enqueue functions to be slightly different for the process queue and locks! (Think about what the next_process pointer should point to)
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
 </list>
 <paragraph>
  Because of this, it's probably easier to just define a new function (enqueue_lock) inside of lock.c, and use that for enqueuing to lists of blocked processes

  I added extern declarations in shared_structs.h to use those functions in lock.c.
