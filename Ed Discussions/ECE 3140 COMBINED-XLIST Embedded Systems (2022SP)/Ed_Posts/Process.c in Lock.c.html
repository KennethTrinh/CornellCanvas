 Can we #include "process.c" in lock.c (I am trying to use process.c's enqueue function)
</p>

  I added extern declarations in shared_structs.h to use those functions in lock.c.

   You

   , but a couple things arise:
  </p>
  <list style="bullet">
   <li>
    <p>
     At least when I tried it, I got linker errors of multiple definitions (it was defining the enqueue function twice somewhere), even with pre-compiler #ifndef statements (yea, it was weird)
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     You actually want your enqueue functions to be slightly different for the process queue and locks! (Think about what the next_process pointer should point to)
    </p>
   </li>
  </list>
  <p>
   Because of this, it's probably easier to just define a new function (enqueue_lock) inside of lock.c, and use that for enqueuing to lists of blocked processes
  </p>
