 Hi! In Lecture 2.2 you talked about performing subtractions on the stack pointer. Why would you want to do that and would this mean that you would update the SP with the new value or just find out the result of subtracting a value from the current stack pointer?

 Thanks!

  Hi, Sorry for the delay.

  Great question.

  At this point this is sort of a wired instruction, but this week's lectures should make it clear why/when you want to manipulate the SP directly. The result should be stored back to SP. The short answer is that you want to SUB/ADD to the SP in order to allocate/deallocate local variables during a function call.
