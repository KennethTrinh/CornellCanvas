  I notice that the prelab 1 questions on the Canvas assignment and the lab1.pdf handout are slightly different. Which set of questions should we answer?

  They should not be released yet! Sorry I fixed that. The right version(s) should be out in a couple of hours. But to answer your question directly, the pre-lab 1 questions are up to date.
