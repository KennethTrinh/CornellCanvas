  It depends a little on your project, but we would like to see what you thought about the different functional subsystems are and how they interact. In the proposal we wanted to see the big idea, and here we want to see some more concrete design choices either in hardware or software.  A fair number of proposals already had a fair amount of detail, so you can re-use that text.

  For your audience, think about how you would explain your project and your technical approach to another student in this class. In the proposal it was fine to have some questions, but here we want you to have made concrete choices to show that you have started working on the project.  For example, in the proposal something along the lines of "We will either use i2c or spi to talk to a sensor" was fine, but now we would like to see something along the lines of "We found that part X has the best performance for your application, and we will use its i2c interface to communicate with the processor."
