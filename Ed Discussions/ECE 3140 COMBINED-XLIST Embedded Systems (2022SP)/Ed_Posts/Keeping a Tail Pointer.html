  The lab document mentions that
 </paragraph>
 <blockquote>
  While you can use this basic version of a linked list, a useful extension would be a slightly more complex list that keeps track of both the start and end, so that you can quickly insert tasks at the end without having to traverse the list firsts.
 </blockquote>
 <paragraph>
  To my understanding, right now, process_queue works as the pointer to the head of the linked list (or is that current_process?). Can I simply declare a global variable in process.c, changing the value on enqueue, to maintain a pointer to the last element of my list?

  Your understanding is correct. Whether or not the head of the linked list also happens to be
  <code>
   current_process
  </code>
  is up to your implementation.

  Yes, you are allowed to create a new global variable that acts as a tail pointer.
