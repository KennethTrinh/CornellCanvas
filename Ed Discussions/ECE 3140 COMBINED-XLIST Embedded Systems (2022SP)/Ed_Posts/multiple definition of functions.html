 I am consistently getting this error when trying to build my program. Normally this would be because some #include is being done more than once, but I checked that and it should be fine. More curiously, the place that MCUExpress points to where the function is "first defined" is the file itself. I can't place what is going wrong.

 I also excluded Framework2.c from the build; now Framework1.c has the only main() function in the project.

 Please make this post private if it has too much revealing info, i was careful to not include any actual code in the screenshots.

  . in Framework1.c i included "LED.c" instead of "LED.h"
 </p>
 <p>
  i think i get why the multiple definitions error came up. I think its bc when building it compiles everything; so "LED.c" compiles and defines the functions, but then file with main() also compiles and includes "LED.c" which tries to define everything again. Thats why the error mentioned a .o file of the same name; bc the first definition of the functions already compiled.
