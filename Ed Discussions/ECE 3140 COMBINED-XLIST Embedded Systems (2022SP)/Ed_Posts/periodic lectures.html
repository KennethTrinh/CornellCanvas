<p>
 Can the lectures about periodic tasks be released so we can do the extra credit for lab 5?
</p>
<p>
 Per the course syllabus these lectures were supposed to have been assigned for the week of 4/12 such that we would have learned the content required to do this extra credit before lab 5 is due. Thank you!
