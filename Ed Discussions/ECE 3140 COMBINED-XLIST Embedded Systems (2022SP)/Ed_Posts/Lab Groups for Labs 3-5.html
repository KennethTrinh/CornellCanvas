  Hi Everyone,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The next three labs will be done in randomly assigned groups. We formed groups within a discussion section so that you can more easily work together and work on the discussion section exercises with your partner.

  To find your group assignment, go to "People" on Canvas and click on the "Lab Groups" tab. You should be able to search for your name and find your group ID.

 <paragraph>
  You are supposed to learn how to effectively work in teams with people who are relative strangers, so treat your new partner with respect as you would in any professional setting.  For each of the labs you will get to evaluate individually how well you worked as a team.

  If you have medical issues or anticipate long leaves, etc. that would prevent you from being a good team mate please send me an e-mail and we will try to adjust groups in the next few days.

  Good luck!
