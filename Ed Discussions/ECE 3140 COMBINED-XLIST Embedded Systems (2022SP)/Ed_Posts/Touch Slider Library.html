 Our group was trying to use the touch slider's capacitance values for our project. However, when we use the demo code tsi_v4_normal.c, we run into issues trying to figure out how the code is reading the capacitance values. Also, we tried to download the touch sensor library but it's just an IDE. Do you any other resources we could use or demo code to help use the touch slider?
