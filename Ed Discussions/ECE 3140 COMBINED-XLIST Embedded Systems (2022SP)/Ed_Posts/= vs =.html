 I noticed in the Lab 2 handout, in part 1, the clock was enabled using |= like in discussion, but in part 2, the clock is enabled using = . When should |= be used and when should = be used?
</p>
<p>
 Here are the specific example lines:

  I think |= is used to ensure only that bit at bit 12 will be affected by the operation, whereas using = can override other bits on accident

   Correct. The equal sign is the operator for literally assigning values to registers. Or-equal (|=) is short-hand that allows you to perform a bitwise-or and assignment in a single line. `x |= y` expands to `x = x | y`
