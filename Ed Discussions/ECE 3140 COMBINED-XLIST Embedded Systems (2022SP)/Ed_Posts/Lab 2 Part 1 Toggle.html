 I was a bit confused about what the toggle function is supposed to do and I was wondering if someone could help clarify that for me. Does it mean that we just have to use the PTOR to figure out what bits should be preserved and which bits should be changed?

  Just like how writing to a single bit in PCOR or PSOR then clears or set the corresponding bit, writing to a single bit in PTOR will
  <i>
   always
  </i>
  toggle the corresponding bit. You do not need to try and read from it and then decide if you need to set or clear. The read value of the entire PTOR register is always 0.
