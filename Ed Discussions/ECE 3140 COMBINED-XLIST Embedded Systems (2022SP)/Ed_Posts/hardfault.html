  <code>
   g_pfnVectors
  </code>
  is something startup code related, but the real important information there is "at 0x0".  That means that it tried to call or use something at address 0, which is what
  <code>
   NULL
  </code>
  means.  So, this stack trace likely means you're dereferencing a null pointer on line 320 of your process.c.
