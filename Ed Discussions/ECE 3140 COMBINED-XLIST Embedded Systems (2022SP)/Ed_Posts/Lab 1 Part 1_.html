  Part 1 of the lab says that "you may assume that the value stored in R0 is between zero and nine." How can the value stored in R0 be greater than 7, if the registers are defined by 3 bits so max 2^3 -1?

  Please review Napp's slides. He makes it very clear that the registers are 32 bits.

  I think you may be confused by the register names vs. their contents. If you wanted to specify a register from R0 to R7 you would need to use 3 bits (and 4 bits if you wanted to specify any of our 16 registers). However, as Arun said, each of our registers have 32 bits to represent values
