  The registers store 32-bit values. I assume you are using the MOV instruction, which can only work with 8-bit immediate values. So, if you want to get larger values into your registers, you have to define them as a constant 32-bit number at compile time using the .equ directive. Looks something like this:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  .equ constant_name, 0x400FF0D4
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  and load it with:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  LDR Rd, =constant_name
 </paragraph>

  Alternatively, store a smaller value and edit it with operations to make it bigger!
