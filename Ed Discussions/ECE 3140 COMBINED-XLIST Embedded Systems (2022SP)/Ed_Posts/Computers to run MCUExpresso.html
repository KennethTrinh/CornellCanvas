 I have a Mac and I am encountering issues with running MCUExpresso. Are there any places that I can run it and work on my lab?

  I do not believe any of the engineering computer labs (Phillips 318, Upson 225, etc.) have MCUXpresso installed and an individual user would not be able to install it without IT.

  If older versions of MCUXpresso still do not work, you could try running a Windows virtual machine or borrowing a friend's laptop (preferably someone not in the class to avoid potential AI violations).
