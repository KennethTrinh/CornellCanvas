 <paragraph>
  If two real time processes have the same deadline, should they run concurrently, and if not does it matter which goes first?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Example:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  rt1: start: 0, deadline (relative): 5
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  rt2: start: 1, deadline (relative): 4
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Both of these have an absolute deadline of 5
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Should these be concurrent, and if not, which should run first?
