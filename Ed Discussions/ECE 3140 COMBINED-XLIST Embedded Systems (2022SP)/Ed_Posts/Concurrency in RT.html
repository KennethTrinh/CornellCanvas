<p>
 If two real time processes have the same deadline, should they run concurrently, and if not does it matter which goes first?
</p>
<p>
 Example:
</p>
<p>
 rt1: start: 0, deadline (relative): 5
</p>
<p>
 rt2: start: 1, deadline (relative): 4
</p>
<p>
 Both of these have an absolute deadline of 5
</p>
<p>
 Should these be concurrent, and if not, which should run first?
</p>

  It's probably unspecified between which one to choose
