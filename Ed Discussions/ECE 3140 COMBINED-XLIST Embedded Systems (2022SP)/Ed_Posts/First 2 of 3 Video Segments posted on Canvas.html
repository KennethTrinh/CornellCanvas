  Hi All,

  The first two three lecture segments for week three are up now. I still need to edit the last one, but it should be up tonight.  The snowday messed up my recording schedule this week, but in general I'll try to get these to you early in the weekend so you get to prep questions for lecture time on Tuesday.

  This week everyone should get their hands on a board, and we can start working with the hardware!
