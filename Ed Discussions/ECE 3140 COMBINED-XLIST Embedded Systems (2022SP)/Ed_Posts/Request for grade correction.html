 Hi there,
</p>
<p>
 I emailed the professor but have not heard back, so I decided to make a private post.  I made a post a while back ( #846 ) about accidentally placing my index.html in the wrong branch (but it was still turned in on time - check the commit history! ).  My partner and I received a 10 point deduction as a result, despite the professors message in #846.  Can I please get that rectified on cms and/or student center?  My netid is klt45.
</p>
