  I am following the UART tutorial on canvas and was able to get the terminal to output what is displayed in the above image. However, I am unsure about how to get the python file to output  what is in the image below. Is there anything I need to do in order to use the python file and get the output below?

  You probably need to change the port in the serial.Serial initialization. You can find which COM number your board is using in Device Manager. Other than that and installing pyserial, it should work.

  I changed the port in the initialization, and installed pyserial in terminal? Do i need to put the python file inside my folder in MCUXpresso?
