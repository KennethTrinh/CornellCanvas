  Hi All,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  A couple of quick announcements:

  1) We decided to postpone the deadline for Lab 2 for _everyone_ until the Friday after Feb break. The submission site on CMS is open and reflects this new due date. It seems like most of you are on track to finish this week. If you are, please submit and enjoy a relaxing break! The reason we decided to extend is twofold: first, wanted to return Lab 1 BEFORE lab 2 is due so that you can incorporate the feedback on the style / comments that we expect to see. We are not quite done with the code grading but noticed some issues with what we looked at so far. They should be easy to fix, once you know about them. Second, a handful of students were off to slow start with Lab 1, and we wanted to give everyone a chance to catch up. It only seems fair to offer this extension to everyone.

  2) After running the lecture time office hours in person for a couple of weeks, I wanted to switch one of the sessions back to being online. I think that makes it easier to drop by for a quick question rather sitting in the large lecture hall for an hour+, or somewhat awkwardly leaving half way through. The Tuesday sections will keep being in person, but the Thursday sections will be on Zoom and I'll record and post them.
