 What is meant by "how many registers do you think you will need and which ones do you plan to use"? If I need n registers, wouldn't I plan to use all of them?

 Thanks!

  We're asking the number of registers you need to use, and which registers in particular will you use. For example, if you think you need two registers, will you use R0 and R1? R0 and R2? R6 and R7? etc.
