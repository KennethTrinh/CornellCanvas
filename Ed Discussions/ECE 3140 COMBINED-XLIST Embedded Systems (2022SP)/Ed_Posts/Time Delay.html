 Hi, I tried doing something like a decrementing loop for time delay however, it doesn't seem like it's working. I am not sure how to set the timing. So is there any suggestion on doing this to keep the light on in the range of 0.3s - 0.8 s? Thank you!

   right now it says that each registers can only hold immediate values up to 2 bytes...
