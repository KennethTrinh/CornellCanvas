 Is there any chance of getting a sanity checker for our code? In every other CS class I've taken, we could be sure that there wasn't going to be an issue running our code on the grader's machine before turning it in - be it on Gradescope for 3110, CMS for 2112 and 3410, being able to manually run a check script (3110 again), the 4820 autograder with public tests, or having a small test suite in 2300 and 4160. I think that this would reduce frustrations like that of the Morse code function, where many students I've spoken to felt that the exact memory label name was under-specified in the original document. It's a big shock to get your code back that worked on your machine and learn that it essentially "did not compile" for graders.  I understand it's a time commitment, but it would really help students feel more confident in their code submissions.
