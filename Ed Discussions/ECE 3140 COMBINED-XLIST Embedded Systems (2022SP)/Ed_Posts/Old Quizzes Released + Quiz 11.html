  I was wondering when we could see our scores for the old quizzes and when quiz 11 would be released? Also, if released today, would it be due today?

  For anyone who checks Ed or is following this thread, quiz 11 was released and is due on the 29th, which is Friday. There seems to be no official announcement.

  Ok thank you so much! I just noticed you can access it when you go to Grades instead of Modules (like how we usually access it).
