 The github pages site says that we should make a "video demo" of the project, but a many of the past years videos go into much more detail than just a demo. Should we also discuss the hardware / code involved in the project? If so, how much depth should we go into? Or just show it working?

  I am not a grader, but I would say that you should give some technical description without going into extreme detail (i.e. don't make it too boring).

    I do not have a rubric so all I, personally, can say is to reference past videos to get a sense of what you should be covering.
