 I remember Professor mentioned at the beginning of the semester that we'll have something due every Friday? Not sure if there is anything due this week though - asking for planning purposes.

 Thank you!

  Yeah, I just posted it ... but moved the Canvas deadline for the pre-lab to Mon so you have a few more days.
