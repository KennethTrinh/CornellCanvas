 When I step my code through the debugger, everything works properly on the board. However when I run my code (I think I am doing it correctly), nothing happens. Is there a way to check if it is running on the board/any common solutions to this?

  I think that this part might be the issue. Which file do I put in to program?

   I am also having this issue. It seems like I can't change what project runs on the board- that's the only thing in the drop down for me.

  By nothing happens do you mean the LED does not flash? If so that means that you are not waiting long enough between turning it on and turning it off. When in the debugger if you hit continue once it starts can you see the LED flash?

   When I run it in the debugger, all of the dots &amp; dashes are of appropriate length and I can see them turn on and off on the board. That is what makes me think the issue is with the way I am uploading to the board. By nothing happens I mean the led's do not flash, but I know they should be because it works when I debug.

    The code also stays on the board after I debug it, and runs successfully when I reset it, my question is why it doesn't upload when I hit the upload button.
