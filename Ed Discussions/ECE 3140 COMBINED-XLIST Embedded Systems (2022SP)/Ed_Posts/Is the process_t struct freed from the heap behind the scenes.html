 Wasn't sure if we had to also keep track of the process state memory allocation. Thanks!

  No it isn't! You need to make sure to free not only the process stack, but the process_t struct as well. In general, whenever there is a malloc(), you should think about where the corresponding free() will be (no memory should be left allocated at the end of runtime)
