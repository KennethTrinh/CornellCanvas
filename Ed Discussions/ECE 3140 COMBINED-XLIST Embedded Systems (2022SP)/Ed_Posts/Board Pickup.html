 My recitation is on Friday, and I was hoping to collect my board before then. Can I collect it from the professor's office/ any other recitation? I know there were times set for last week, so I was wondering if there will be similar times set for this week for board pickup?

  We'll be passing out the boards at the beginning of discussion. We'll try to bring some extras in case people want to pick theirs up early.
