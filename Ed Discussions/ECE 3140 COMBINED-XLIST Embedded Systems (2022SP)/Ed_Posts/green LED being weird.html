 During Test case 1 it looks like the green LED wants to flash (just a little bit of green) and then the red takes over.

 These don't look like toggles or flashes but weird in-betweens for the green LED.. what does this mean?

  First, see

  . Using the concept of readers and writers, try to determine which processes are allowed to run at the same time and which processes are not. It may help if you modify it to a simpler case where you have a single reader and single writer, and then start adding in the other processes once you get that working.
