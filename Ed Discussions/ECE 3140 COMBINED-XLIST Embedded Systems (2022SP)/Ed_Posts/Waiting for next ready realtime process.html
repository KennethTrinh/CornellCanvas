 Is there a way that we can make the scheduler execute NOPs while it waits for the next ready when there are no more non-realtime processes and no ready realtime processes? Or is there a better way of waiting?

  When it came to the busy waiting situation, changing the interrupt priority wasn't really doing anything for me. I just ended up doing polling for when the second PIT channel hit its mark (review lab 2 for reference) and then I incremented the current time accordingly. I put that polling in the while loop that busy waits until the current time reaches the start time of the next unready realtime process. I mean since we are busy waiting already polling won't really destroy performance. I could be wrong though so please feel free to correct me TAs.

   This is also a valid method.

   You shouldn't just schedule an arbitrary number of NOPs, you should be checking for the condition for when the process's arrival time is greater than the current time.

    If we busy wait checking that condition, won't that prevent the second PIT timer interrupt from being triggered?

     That is why you must make sure your priorities are configured correctly and that interrupts are enabled before you go into your busy loop.
