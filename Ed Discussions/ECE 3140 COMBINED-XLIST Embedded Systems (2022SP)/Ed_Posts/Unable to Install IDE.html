 When I was trying to install the IDE, I kept running into this page.

 How should I go about getting the IDE?

  If you are an international student and set your address to something outside of the United States, NXP may block you from accessing their products. If possible, try changing your address to your local Ithaca address. If not, you may need to make another account.
