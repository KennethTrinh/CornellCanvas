 When it says "Make sure all data structures you need are correctly initialized" in the instructions for process_start, does that just mean we need to check that the process queue exists? Is there anything else we are missing?

  Think about what the initial state of your linked list will look like following the calls to
  <i>
   process_create()
  </i>
  . The exact initialization required will be dependent on your implementation.
