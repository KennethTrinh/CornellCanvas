  Hi All,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  After reading the mid-term evaluation I’d like to make to make some changes for the lectures after April break. Several students reasonably pointed out that the lecture time of the “flipped” classroom model could be improved. Right now, the students that show up regularly with questions get something out of them (I hope!), but that is a minority of students. My goal was to make the class as flexible as possible for everyone, but a more structured lecture time might be more useful to more students. I propose that we spend each lecture time

  , and that we have a short review followed by some worked problems or application examples that go into more depth about the material. To that end, I added a question at the end of the weekly lecture quizzes on what you’d like to see. Please put any lingering questions there and I’ll try to address them in that week’s lecture time sessions. That way students get to listen in on each-others questions and get to participate without having to prepare specific questions.

  Since I don’t want to add to the overall time commitment for the class, after about 30-45 min, we will have a short break to shake your your legs and allow students who feel comfortable with the material to leave. After the half-way point, we will transition to student driven questions about any of the lectures, quiz questions etc. I’m happy to answer questions about the labs too, but would like to keep that material mostly covered in the discussion sections and use the lecture time to go into more detail about stuff that is not strictly necessary to complete the labs. I won’t take attendance, but hope that you can make at least one of the lecture times each week. If your mid-term evaluation feedback was that you'd like more in-person face time, this is your chance! Since the final project is coming, I’ll work up some examples on now to use external components.

  Let’s keep tomorrow online. I’ll will start with a short example on how to use LDREX/STREX in the more advanced ARM ISAs to implement a spinlock. It’s cool because you don’t actually need the whole Read-Modify-Write instruction to be atomic, as long as you can detect that something went wrong when there is contention for the lock. It’s also the approach that modern ARM processors take, so if you end up writing assembly for a fancy new Apple M1 processor, these ideas should look familiar.

  Yes, I will sill post the regular video lecture, but I will do more review / exercises during the in-class lecture times. If the pervious format worked for you, great. There are no major changes.

  Some students felt like a little lost and without much support for understanding the video lecture material.  The changes are supposed to supplement the online lectures, and help deepen some of the topics.
