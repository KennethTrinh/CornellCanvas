 Hi, should we consider test cases with conflicting processes (for example, p1 toggles the Green LED once every 1 sec and p2 toggles the Green LED every 0.1 sec)?

  I'm not sure these would be "conflicting" - both would still execute, and have some behavior. You could still do it, you just may have to think more about what you'd expect to see
