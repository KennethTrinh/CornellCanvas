  Do we need to implement certain class concepts or certain portion of c code or are we open to use anything as long as we use the board in a significant way (like inputs to another software)?

  Looking for a team member for the final project and to discuss potential ideas for the project proposal. Some of the ideas I'm thinking of are: detecting errors when playing an instrument, stats and crash detection for cycling, password protected lock using a keyboard/keypad peripheral. You can reach me at
  <link href="mailto:vs339@cornell.edu"/>
  vs339@cornell.edu!

  Your final code must on GitHub by the final project deadline. You do not need to use git for your workflow, but the final result must be up there. Anything committed after midnight will not be graded. There will not be an CMSX submission.

  I believe the entire project structure. That would allow us to see the other set up files that may be required for certain SDK example based code.
