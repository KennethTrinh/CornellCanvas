 I'm wondering if there is a way a lab session(s) can be virtual, semi-virtual, or held in Philips 318. I'm forced to use the computers in Philips 318 (the board still does not work with my laptop), and it would be great if I could get help instantly instead of running back and forth between OH and the computer lab to make changes/run code.
