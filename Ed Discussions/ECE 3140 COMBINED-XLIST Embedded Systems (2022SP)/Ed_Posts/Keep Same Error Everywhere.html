 Everywhere I use an arrow, I get this error:
</p>
<p>
 "invalid use of incomplete typedef 'process_t' {aka 'struct process_state'}"
</p>
<p>
 However, there isn't even a process_state anywhere in my code when I search for it. Any help?
</p>

  In 3140_concur.h:
 </p>
 <pre>struct process_state;
typedef struct process_state process_t;</pre>
 <p>
  The arrow operator is syntactic sugar for dereference then accessing a member. The following lines are equivalent:
 </p>
 <pre>(*ptr).member
ptr-&gt;member</pre>
 <p>
  This only works when
  <code>
   ptr
  </code>
  is a pointer to a struct.

   The following is a snippet of my code showing one example of the error, along with my struct definition and two initializations. From what I understand, since node is a pointer to a process_t, node-&gt;next should be valid, since it dereferences and then gets the field. So shouldn't this work?

    At the top of 3140_concur.h you will see:
   </p>
   <pre>struct process_state;
typedef struct process_state process_t;
   /* opaque definition of process type; you must provide this
      implementation.
            
            To do this, write code similar to the following in your process.c:
            
            struct process_state {
                int var1;
                struct process_state* some_pointer;
            };
   */
</pre>
   <p>
    The struct is named
    <code>
     process_state
    </code>
    , but is then
    <code>
     typedef
    </code>
    'd to
    <code>
     process_t
    </code>
    . Your struct definition is incorrect since you are trying to define
    <code>
     process_t
    </code>
    , which confuses the compiler.
   </p>
   <p>
    Unrelated note, please use the name
    <code>
     process_queue
    </code>
    instead of just
    <code>
     queue
    </code>
    as to be consistent with the declarations in 3140_concur.h:
   </p>
   <pre>extern process_t* current_process; 
extern process_t* process_queue;</pre>
