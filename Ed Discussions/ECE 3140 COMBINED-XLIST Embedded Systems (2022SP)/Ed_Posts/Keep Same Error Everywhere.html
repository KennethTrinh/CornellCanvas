  Everywhere I use an arrow, I get this error:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  "invalid use of incomplete typedef 'process_t' {aka 'struct process_state'}"
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  However, there isn't even a process_state anywhere in my code when I search for it. Any help?

  In 3140_concur.h:
 </paragraph>
 <pre>struct process_state;
typedef struct process_state process_t;</pre>
 <paragraph>
  The arrow operator is syntactic sugar for dereference then accessing a member. The following lines are equivalent:
 </paragraph>
 <pre>(*ptr).member
ptr-&gt;member</pre>
 <paragraph>
  This only works when
  <code>
   ptr
  </code>
  is a pointer to a struct.

  The following is a snippet of my code showing one example of the error, along with my struct definition and two initializations. From what I understand, since node is a pointer to a process_t, node-&gt;next should be valid, since it dereferences and then gets the field. So shouldn't this work?

  At the top of 3140_concur.h you will see:
 </paragraph>
 <pre>struct process_state;
typedef struct process_state process_t;
   /* opaque definition of process type; you must provide this
      implementation.
            
            To do this, write code similar to the following in your process.c:
            
            struct process_state {
                int var1;
                struct process_state* some_pointer;
            };
   */
</pre>
 <paragraph>
  The struct is named
  <code>
   process_state
  </code>
  , but is then
  <code>
   typedef
  </code>
  'd to
  <code>
   process_t
  </code>
  . Your struct definition is incorrect since you are trying to define
  <code>
   process_t
  </code>
  , which confuses the compiler.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Unrelated note, please use the name
  <code>
   process_queue
  </code>
  instead of just
  <code>
   queue
  </code>
  as to be consistent with the declarations in 3140_concur.h:
 </paragraph>
 <pre>extern process_t* current_process; 
extern process_t* process_queue;</pre>
