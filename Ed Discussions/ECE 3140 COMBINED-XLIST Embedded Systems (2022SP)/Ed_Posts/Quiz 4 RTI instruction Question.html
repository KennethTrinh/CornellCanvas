  I put "Execute RTI Instruction" as an answer because of the third bullet here. I understand that there is no literal RTI instruction, but I thought it was an okay answer since it was directly from the slide. So why was this not acceptable?

  The question was: How do you trigger a "return from interrupt"?

  The slide you are referencing talking about how the processor pretends to have a return

  from interrupt instruction. In the slide I posted, it distinctly says that there is no literal instruction. The answer on the quiz states that we are literally running a return from interrupt instruction. However, that is not the case. We are just symbolizing that with the special value that is loaded into the PC. The answer "Execute the RTI instruction" would be wrong since there is no actual instruction.
