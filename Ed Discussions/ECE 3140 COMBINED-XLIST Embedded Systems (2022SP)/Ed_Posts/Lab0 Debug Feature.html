  I am trying to use the debug feature in MUCXpresso for lab0 and I don't see any options under debug as. Is there a way to configure that?

  I think we need the board for completing this part because this is under the "Once you have the Board" segment.

  According to the handout, once we build lab0.s, we simply take a screenshot and have to submit that screenshot to get credit.

  Ok got it. I saw another screenshot requirement under 6.0 so I was wondering if we need to do the debug section. Also btw do you know if the assignment on cms is released?

  I don't see it on CMS yet, so probably not.
