  Posts in the past have had responses that the grading for each lab is almost done. I'm assuming the response to this one will be similar.

  If we could get our lab grades sometime before the semester ends, that'd be pretty cool.

  Since both Lab 4 and Lab 5 depend on our implementation of Lab 3, could we please get our Lab 3 back? Also, will graders be lenient with issues in Lab 3 that may have propagated into Labs 4 and 5? We were promised our Lab 3 back to catch these issues but we never got it back.

  Students were able to request sample solutions of Lab 3 so they could continue with Labs 4 and 5 without worrying about propagation errors.

  I also have concerns about errors on lab reports, which were being made for the first time with new partners, propagating forward. For example, you could have had too few comments or bad code readability in lab 3, and this would follow you forward to labs 4 and 5 simply because the correction isn't available. Your partner could have reached a compromise with you on lab report standards that leads to points off on labs 3, 4, and 5. I have been using similar diagrams on all three lab reports, which could have an issue and I'd have no idea.

  That still doesn't justify the unkept promise that we would have Lab 3 back before Lab 4 was due.

  We were told a month ago #505 "We are trying to finish grading lab3 before Thursday. But feel free to request the lab3 solutions if you are not confident in your implementation. "
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The implication was that we would have our grades Thursday and have that day and Friday to make any corrections if necessary. If we didn't want to wait until Thursday, we could request the solutions at the cost of dealing with unfamiliar code (not written by us). The grades never came, contrary to what staff implied. A more honest response would have been, "We will not have Lab 3 graded. Feel free to request the lab3 solutions if you are not confident in your implementation."
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I think it was reasonable to expect staff to stay true to their words and deliver grades on that Thursday, and I think we are owed an apology for the delay.
