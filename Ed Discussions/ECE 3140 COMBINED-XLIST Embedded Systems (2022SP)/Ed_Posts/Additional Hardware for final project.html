 Is there an easy way to hook up the boards to a motor or a servo of some kind?

  For a motor, you should not try to directly hook it up to the boards output pins since they will not be able to delivery enough current. Trying to draw such a current would fry the pin, port, or possibly entire board. A motor should be hooked up using an H-bridge and an external power supply. You can then supply the appropriate signals to the H-bridge to spin the motor.

  For something like a servo, they usually have pins for power, ground, and control. Power and ground can be hooked up to an external supply, and the control pin can be connected to a pin on the KL46Z set up for PWM.

   Amazing, are there any brands that have worked well in the past? For reference my current idea for the project involves automating a fishing rod

    If you are buying hardware, doing a Google search or check Amazon or other reviews to see if it works well with other MCU platforms (Arduino, etc.)
