 I noticed that for Lab 2, when I submitted the files onto CMS, it renamed the files to part2.c and part3.c. Is it okay if I just left the file names as Framework1.c and Framework2.c when I made the submission?

  CMS always renames your files to "LED.c", "part2.c" and "part3.c", as long as your files were submitted to the corresponding parts, you won't get any deduction. And I checked your submissions, they look good :)
