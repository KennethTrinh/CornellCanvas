 How do we write a main function, do we still need the void?
</p>
<p>
 What exactly should we call to test our LED.c file?
</p>

  I think you can just make another filed called like test.c and make a main method (like
  <code>
   int main (void) {}
  </code>
  ) in which you can call each of your LED.c functions and step through each of them. You could also probably just do it inside of the main method in Framework1.c

   Thank you! Were you able to debug (step-through) your test case file
