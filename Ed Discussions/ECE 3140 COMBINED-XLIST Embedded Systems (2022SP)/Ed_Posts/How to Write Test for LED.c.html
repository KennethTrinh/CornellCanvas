  How do we write a main function, do we still need the void?

  What exactly should we call to test our LED.c file?

  I think you can just make another filed called like test.c and make a main method (like
  <code>
   int main (void) {}
  </code>
  ) in which you can call each of your LED.c functions and step through each of them. You could also probably just do it inside of the main method in Framework1.c
