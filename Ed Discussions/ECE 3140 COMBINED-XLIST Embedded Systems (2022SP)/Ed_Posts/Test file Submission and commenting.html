<p>
 Should I leave a test case commented or uncommented out? For compilation, I can only have 1 test file uncommented or else I will run into the multiple main methods in project error.
</p>
<p>
 I will assume that I should just leave all the test files uncommented.
</p>
<p>
 Also, we are submitting our
 <code>
  source
 </code>
 folder and nothing else?
</p>

  Do not leave anything commented out. Anything commented out may potentially not be graded.

  As per the lab document:
