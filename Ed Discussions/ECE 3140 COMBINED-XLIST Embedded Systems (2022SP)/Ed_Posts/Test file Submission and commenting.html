  Should I leave a test case commented or uncommented out? For compilation, I can only have 1 test file uncommented or else I will run into the multiple main methods in project error.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I will assume that I should just leave all the test files uncommented.

  Also, we are submitting our
  <code>
   source
  </code>
  folder and nothing else?

  Do not leave anything commented out. Anything commented out may potentially not be graded.

  As per the lab document:

  "concurrency.zip: The entire implementation and test cases, including the files we have provided. Only include the .h, .c, and .s files. Do not induce MCUXpresso project files or other source or header files not mentioned in this handout."
