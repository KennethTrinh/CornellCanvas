  Yes, you actually have to do current_time.sec since current_time is
  <b>
   not
  </b>
  a pointer to a struct with a
  <i>
   sec
  </i>
  property. It is just the struct itself with a
  <i>
   sec
  </i>
  property.
  <code>
   pointer_name -&gt; property
  </code>
  is shorthand for
  <code>
   (*pointer_name).property
  </code>
  so you only really need to use -&gt; when you are trying to access the property of a struct that a pointer is pointing to.
