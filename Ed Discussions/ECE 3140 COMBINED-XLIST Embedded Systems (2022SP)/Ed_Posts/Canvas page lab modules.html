  Under lab support module in Canvas, there are two links, project description and submission details/grading rubric. They both seem to be unrelated to lab 0 and are out of date (dated Spring 2020), should we just ignore those until they become relevant/become updated?

  I think they are guidelines for the final project. Probably not relevant at the moment

  Yeah, not relevant yet. I'll fix that and re-release it when it becomes relevant.
