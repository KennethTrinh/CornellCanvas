 Does our board accept Analog input or only Digital I/O?

  The KL46Z does have an ADC module (3.7.1 in the processor manual), of which it has multiple channels for performing analog to digital conversions (3.7.1.3.1). See the pin out table (10.3.1) to see which pins can be mapped to which channels (similar method as to how we selected ALT1 (001) to get the LEDs working as GPIO).
