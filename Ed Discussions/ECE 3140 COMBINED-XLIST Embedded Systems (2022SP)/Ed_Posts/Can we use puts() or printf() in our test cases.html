  We are currently using puts() to display a counter that we are incrementing in each process.

 <paragraph>
  Are we allowed to do this?

  You're allowed to use print statements in debugging if you find them helpful. If you're using this counter to keep track of where the process is, you should be using a stack pointer instead. If you're using this as a variable to keep track of the status of your process,  this is fine (but it's not necessary to print it to keep track of it, once again this would just be for debugging I assume?). If you're using this to keep track of LED blinks/toggles, you should follow the convention used in test case 0 that we provide instead.
