 Webpage checking: 5/10/22 (last day of class, check that you made page and give short progress report)
</p>
<p>
 So, all we have to do for today is give a thorough short progress report on the web page? What does it mean by you made page? Does clicking on autogenerating page count as creating a page?

   So, for today, we just need to do the Introduction, Progress Report 5/10 and the System Overview on the webpage ?
