  Is there any way to check to make sure there are no memory leaks when a program runs?  I do call free for malloc, but I was wondering if there is anything in the IDE that could point to whether all memory was deallocated.

  Unfortunately, MCUXpresso does not have support for memory leak detection (as far as I am aware) and we do not have a way to run Valgrind on our systems.

  See the lab3 doc, Note 3 on Page 6. You should assume so.
