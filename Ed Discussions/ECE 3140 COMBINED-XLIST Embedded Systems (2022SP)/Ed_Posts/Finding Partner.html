  I am wondering if it is possible to post our partner's netID for each group? Not every partner attends to discussion and has contact with each other. So having netID as the resource would be great! Thank you!

  You can go to Canvas -&gt; People -&gt; Groups -&gt; search your name and your group/partner should pop up. You can look up their netID in the Cornell directory or gmail. Hope this helps!
