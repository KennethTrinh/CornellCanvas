 Hi all,
</p>
<p>
 Many people have had initialization problems when trying to use the demos that use the on-board IMU. As a quick fix, I have found that a delay inserted during the initialization process fixes the problem for my board for the bubble and bubble_peripheral demo. Attached is a modified version of fsl_mma.c with the fix. If you replace the fsl_mma.c file included in the accel folder in the demos it should (hopefully) work.
