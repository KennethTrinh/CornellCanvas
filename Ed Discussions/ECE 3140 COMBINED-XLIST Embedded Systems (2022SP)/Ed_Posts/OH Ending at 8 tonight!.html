  Can you make a zoom link for questions? I'm having trouble debugging my Lab 5 and was waiting in office hours :/

  For lab 5, we seem to be stuck in the PIT_IRQHandler. We enable the interrupts and start the timers for channels 0 and 1 by setting TCTRL to 3 in process_start, and then don't touch it again. Is there any other reason why we might be near-continuously interrupting? I too would appreciate a Zoom link for questions as I'm quarantining and can't attend in-person OH!

  Did you remember to clear your TFLG for channel 1 in your PIT1_Service() function (and while polling as you wait for realtime processes to become ready when you have nothing else to run).

  Have you made sure that your load values aren't too small for the timers? See

  I saw that post! I had increased it to be as long as channel 0 just for debugging, but it didn't seem to change anything.

  Our Lab 5 code is hard faulting in 3140.s, but this code was given to us. Any thoughts?
