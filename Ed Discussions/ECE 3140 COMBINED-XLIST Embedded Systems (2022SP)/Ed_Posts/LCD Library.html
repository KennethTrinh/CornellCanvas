  Hi all,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I have a written a library to help students use the on-board LCD. The library has functions to write digits, decimal points, and the colon and additionally makes it easier to turn on or off individual segments for those of you who may want to write words.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The library is under the Final Project module on Canvas. Let me know if you have any questions/problems!
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Good luck with the project,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Aaron

  Hi, I just downloaded the library and demo and tried to run it, but am missing
  <code>
   fsl_slcd.h
  </code>
  , do you have any suggestions on where I could find it? I looked under drivers but did not see it. Thanks!

  I can't seem to find fsl_slcd.h in the drivers directory. Is there some way to find this header file and add it to my project if I don't have this file?

  Are you sure you have the correct SDK example downloaded? Try File-&gt;New -&gt; Import SDK Examples. Then choose the frdmkl46z (be sure to choose the correct board, click next, click the dropdown arrow next to driver_examples, selecting slcd and then hit finish. Finally in the drivers folder in the frdmkl46z_slcd project folder you should see the fsl_slcd.h file

  I don't have my computer in front of me right now so I can't check, but it's probably in one of the other files in the slcd sdk example. Setup the example and then carefully check through all of the subdirectories (board, drivers, etc) in the project directory to find the file, then add it to your project. When I get access to my computer I can try to check myself

  Hi again, I imported the slcd SDK example and am now able to run the demo. However, when I run the code I get an error in
  <code>
   lcd.c
  </code>
  for
  <break>
  </break>
  /* Hardware initialize. */
  <break>
  </break>
  BOARD_InitPins();
  <break>
  </break>
  BOARD_BootClockRUN();
  <break>
  </break>
  the error says that
  <code>
   BOARD_InitPins();
  </code>
  is an undefined reference and
  <code>
   BOARD_BootClockRUN();
  </code>
  has a similar issue. Any idea what might be causing this? Thanks

  BOARD_InitPins() and BOARD_BootClockRUN() are both methods defined in pin_mux.c in the "board" directory of the example. Make sure you downloaded the correct sdk demo and if you're using it in another project you need to make sure you copy over

   all
  </italic>
  of the files from the sdk slcd demo to your new project.

  Benjamin is correct. You can also take a look at the documentation for the LCD so that you know which digit is which.

  Does the LCD use port D somehow? The library works fine for me usually, but when I try to use it in a project that also uses some pins on port D for external peripherals nothing shows up.

  It uses all of the ports. In pin_mux.c in the slcd demo you can see how it initializes all of the pins for the LCD screen, including D0
