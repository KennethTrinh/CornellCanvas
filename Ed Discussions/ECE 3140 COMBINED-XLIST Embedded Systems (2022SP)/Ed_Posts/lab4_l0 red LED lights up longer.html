 Hi, when testing our implementation the red LED lights up for longer periods for some of the blinks, is that expected behavior?

  Make sure you carefully read through
  <code>
   lab4_l0.c
  </code>
  and understand what the locks are accomplishing. What

   thing
  </i>
  is being treated as the "shared memory"? Can multiple processes be inside their CS at the same time?
