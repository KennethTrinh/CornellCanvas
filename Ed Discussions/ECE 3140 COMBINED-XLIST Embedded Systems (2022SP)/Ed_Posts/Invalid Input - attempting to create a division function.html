 MOV R7, =0x199A // R7 = 1/10 * 2^16
</p>
<p>
 MOV R7, #6554 // R7 = 1/10 * 2^16
</p>
<p>
 Whichever version of this function I try to execute, I get the error:
 <i>
  invalid immediate: 6554 is out of range
 </i>
</p>

  I think it's because the MOV instruction has a limited set of bits that can be used for passing in the immediate value. I believe there's some way to define a constant within the file and then use a different instruction to directly load that constant into your register, or you could use MOV on a smaller value and multiply your way up

   This is correct. I recommend loading a variable from memory as we did in the assembly tutorial for the second discussion.
