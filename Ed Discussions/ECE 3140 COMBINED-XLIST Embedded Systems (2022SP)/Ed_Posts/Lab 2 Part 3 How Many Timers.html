 For lab 2 part 3, is it better to have:
</p>
<list style="bullet">
 <li>
  <p>
   a 1 sec timer that triggers an interrupt that turns on LED and starts a 0.1 sec timer (which will trigger an interrupt to turn off the LED)
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   a 0.1 sec timer that increments a counter, so that the LED turns on when the counter is 0 and turns off when the counter is 1, and the counter is reset when it reaches 10
  </p>
 </li>
</list>
<p>
 I'm not sure what would be a better approach
</p>

  I think you are only supposed to use one PIT  timer.
