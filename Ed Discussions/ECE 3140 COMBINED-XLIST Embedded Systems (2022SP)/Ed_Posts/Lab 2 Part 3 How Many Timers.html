  For lab 2 part 3, is it better to have:
 </paragraph>
 <list style="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    a 1 sec timer that triggers an interrupt that turns on LED and starts a 0.1 sec timer (which will trigger an interrupt to turn off the LED)
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    a 0.1 sec timer that increments a counter, so that the LED turns on when the counter is 0 and turns off when the counter is 1, and the counter is reset when it reaches 10
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
 </list>
 <paragraph>
  I'm not sure what would be a better approach

  I think you are only supposed to use one PIT  timer.
