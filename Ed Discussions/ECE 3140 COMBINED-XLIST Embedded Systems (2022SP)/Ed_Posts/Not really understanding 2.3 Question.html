  I was confused about this 2.3 example here. I don't understand why the half word 0xadbe is not memory aligned and why 0xefbe is in big-endian form.

  I also was trying to figure out this question and didn't understand how to do this one either. Why are the strings interleaved with each other and why is systems not included in the address? Also why is address 3 related to the strings in address 1 and 2? Wouldn't it be it's own string, unrelated to addr. 1 and 2 (since we just load an address 3 into a register 3)?

  Words and half words are aligned. Slide 12 provides a nice diagram of the legally accessible half-words. The first (MSB) and second bytes in a word form a half-word, and the third and fourth (LSB) bytes in a word form a half-word. Forming 0xadbe would use a byte from the first half-word and a byte from the second half-word.

  0xdeadbeef is arranged in memory such that the MSB 0xde is at the highest address and the LSB 0xef is at the lowest address. That means we are working in little endian where the accessible half-words are 0xdead and 0xbeef.
