  Hi, apologies but I made an index.html for my checkup (if you look at the commit history it was turned in on time), but it appears that most people use gh-pages.  May I use the index.html for the final webpage or should I convert everything to gh-pages?

  We do not care if you use the page generator or make a custom website, as long as it's located on the gh-pages branch and is visible at the pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu..... URL.

  Thanks for pointing this out.  We will give you credit for the index.html in the main branch for the checkin.
