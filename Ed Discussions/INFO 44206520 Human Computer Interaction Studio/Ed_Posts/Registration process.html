  I have received several questions about the registration process for this course. As in the past, students will be registered at once after having settled on a group and a project topic.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If we were to reach a point where the enrollment is bigger than we can manage (this seems quite unlikely), I give priority to students:

 <list style="unordered">
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    who need the class to graduate this semester;
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    for whom this is the last time they can take the class;
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    who applied in the past but did not get in;
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
 </list>
 <paragraph>
  I am expecting to send the PIN around Sep 1.
