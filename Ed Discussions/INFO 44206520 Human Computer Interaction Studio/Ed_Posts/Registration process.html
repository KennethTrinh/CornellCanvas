 I have received several questions about the registration process for this course. As in the past, students will be registered at once after having settled on a group and a project topic.
</p>
<p>
 If we were to reach a point where the enrollment is bigger than we can manage (this seems quite unlikely), I give priority to students:
</p>
<list style="unordered">
 <li>
  <p>
   who need the class to graduate this semester;
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   for whom this is the last time they can take the class;
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   who applied in the past but did not get in;
  </p>
 </li>
</list>
<p>
 I am expecting to send the PIN around Sep 1.
</p>
<p>
 Francois.
