  Hi Zekun, I'm a Master's student and I saw in our syllabus that we have 10% grades for readings and discussions. How can we submit and grade them?

  Hi Qianyu,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  You could go to
  <bold>
   Canvas - Assignments - Graduated Discussions
  </bold>
  to find out the weekly reading materials. And write your reading reflections submit them and reply to others.

  Thank you for the reminder, Zekun! I found the assigned reading, but can't seem to locate the discussion associated with it. I've attached an image of what I see on Canvas.

  Hi Micheal,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Sorry to make it confusing. The deadline is this Friday ( and every following Friday) not Wednesdays. And to clear the air, PhDs and master's students are assigned the same reading materials (
  <bold>
   Canvas - Assignments - Graduated Discussions
  </bold>
  ) and discussion boards. That is to say, the discussion board for this week is
  <bold>
   On Design ( INFO 6520 only, due Sep 2).
