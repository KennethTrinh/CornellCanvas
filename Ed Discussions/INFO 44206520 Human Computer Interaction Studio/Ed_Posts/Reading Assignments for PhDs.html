  Hi Zekun, I'm a Master's student and I saw in our syllabus that we have 10% grades for readings and discussions. How can we submit and grade them?

   Hi Qianyu,
  </p>
  <p>
   You could go to
   <b>
    Canvas - Assignments - Graduated Discussions
   </b>
   to find out the weekly reading materials. And write your reading reflections submit them and reply to others.

     Thank you for the reminder, Zekun! I found the assigned reading, but can't seem to locate the discussion associated with it. I've attached an image of what I see on Canvas.

       Hi Micheal,
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry to make it confusing. The deadline is this Friday ( and every following Friday) not Wednesdays. And to clear the air, PhDs and master's students are assigned the same reading materials (
       <b>
        Canvas - Assignments - Graduated Discussions
       </b>
       ) and discussion boards. That is to say, the discussion board for this week is
       <b>
        On Design ( INFO 6520 only, due Sep 2).
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Best,
      </p>
      <p>
       Zekun
      </p>
