 Hi all,

 I am sorry that my previous remainder was confusing. The followings are a few updates and clarifications.
</p>
<list style="bullet">
 <li>
  <p>
   The reading assignments are required for both
   <b>
    master's students
   </b>
   and
   <b>
    PhDs
   </b>
   .
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   The weekly reading assignments are due on
   <b>
    Friday
   </b>
   every week, not Wednesday, and the first-week reading assignment is
   <b>
    On Design ( INFO 6520 only, due Sep 2).
   </b>
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Where to find the reading materials and post your reflections:

 Best,

  Hi Zekun,
 </p>
 <p>
  I've seen there are three readings in the assignment
  <b>
   On Design
  </b>
  , so do we need to write a summary of each one, or do we only need to choose one reading and write our summary and thoughts?
 </p>
 <p>
  Best,
 </p>
 <p>
  Qianyu
 </p>
