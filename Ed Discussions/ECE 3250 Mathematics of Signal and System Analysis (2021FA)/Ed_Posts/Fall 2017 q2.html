 Can I know the answer to this question? I feel like every choice is wrong. For i, h is not an absolutely integrable signal; for ii, finite duration signals are not absolutely integrable signal; for iii, h*x will be a finite duration signal if h and x are both finite duration signals; for iv, S(x) is unknown and it is possible for the inequality to fail. Which one should be correct for this question? Thanks in advance.

  (ii) is true --- finite duration implies absolutely integrable for decent signals.

 <p>
  BTW on these tests it's possible that nothing could be true in a given problem.

   So for iii, we're only guaranteed h*x has finite duration when both h and x are finite duration, but is it possible to have h*x be finite duration if only one or neither is finite duration?

    Yup.  Think an averager-type $h$ convolved with a zero-mean periodic signal.
