  If I recall correctly,
  <bold>
   F
  </bold>
  is the set of all real and continuous numbers. In class you said that "
  <bold>
   F^R
  </bold>
  is the set of all continuous-time signals." But mathematically, what does
  <bold>
   F^R
  </bold>
  mean? It seems like its the set of all real numbers in
  <bold>
   F
  </bold>
  , but that doesn't seem right.

  Mathematically, $\mathbb{F} ^ {\mathbb{R}}$ is the set of all mappings $x : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{F}$.  It's just like $\mathbb{F} ^ {\mathbb{Z}}$ but with $\mathbb{R}$ replacing $\mathbb{Z}$.  A typical element of the set is a continuous-time signal such as $x$ with specification $x ( t ) = ( e ^ {3 t} \cos ( 2 \pi ( 50 ) t ) u ( t )$ for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$
