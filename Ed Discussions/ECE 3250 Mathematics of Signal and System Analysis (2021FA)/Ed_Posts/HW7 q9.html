  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I am a bit confused about q9.  Does a zero mean decent signal mean that it integrates to 0 over a period? I am not sure how to approach part (a).
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For part b, I was thinking of plugging in x(t) = e^(jwt).  Is this always a valid method for finding the frequency response?  I know I could also find the impulse response h and then find its Fourier Transform pair but this seemed more difficult.
 </paragraph>

  Thank you

  Your take on "zero-mean" in (a) is correct.  For (b), yeah, $e ^ {j \Omega t}$ in, $\widehat{H} ( \Omega ) e ^ {j \Omega t}$ out.

  I am not sure how to show part (a), because isn't that integral then zero by definition of the signal?

  You're supposed to show $S ( x ) = 0$, and didn't you just do that?
