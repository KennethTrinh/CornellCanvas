  So from what I understand the cauchy sequence means if the values in the sequence are getting closer together given a particular difference limit, then the sequence converges. But if, I'm not wrong, then the partial sums of the series 1/n converge, but we know from the integral test that the series 1/n does not. So is it possible to possibly amend or even correct my understanding of a cauchy sequence.

  The partial sums $s _ n = \sum _ {m = 1} ^ n \frac{1}{m}$ don't converge --- if they did, the series $\sum _ {n = 1} ^ \infty \frac{1}{n}$ wold converge --- that's the definition of series convergence.

  I think you might be conflating sequences and series;  A sequence $\{ c _ n \}$ is Cauchy when its terms get closer and closer together.  Turns out that every Cauchy sequence of real or complex numbers converges.
