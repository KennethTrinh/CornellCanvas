  I am having difficulty with question 4. I'm trying to use the definition of the converging sequence {Cn} from class and from the monograph. Should I assume that R = Îµ? Would it be possible for some help/a hint?

  Try this: because the sequence converges to say $\overline{c}$, there exists $N &gt; 0$ so that all the terms $c _ n$ for $n \geq N$ are within, say, 3 of $\overline{c}.  The first $N$ terms in the sequence make up a finite set.  Can you draw an interval centered on 0 that contains all the terms in the sequence if you think of the sequence terms and the limit as points on the real number line?

  Im sorry, this confused me a bit more. So, is the intention to prove that a converging series has to or does not necessarily have to be bounded from the top. If so, i am not sure what you're describing with the finite set and the real number line with the sequence centered at 0 correlates?

  If you can draw an interval of the fomr $[ - R , R ]$ that includes all the terms in the sequence, you've proven that $| c _ n  | \leq R$ for all $n$,
