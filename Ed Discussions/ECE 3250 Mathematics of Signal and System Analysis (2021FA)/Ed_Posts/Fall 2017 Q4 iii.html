  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I am not sure how to go about Q4 (iii); I think it is false but don't see any way of evaluating it to tell
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I think p would have to divide 2^(ed) for this to be true, and I know prime numbers can divide even numbers, so I am not sure if this helps.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I'm lost!

  Any number can be written as the product of prime numbers (prime factorization). Since $(2^{ed})^p$ is a power of 2, its prime factorization only involves 2. No other prime is present. Hence, no other prime can be a factor of it.
