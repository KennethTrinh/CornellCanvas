  I'm having a bit of a hard time seeing how to approach 10. Am I finding an h whose frequency response at the discrete frequencies would be =0 so then the c_k would be 0. But then wouldn't that mean finding the frequency response first and then finding h which doesn't seem to be the order the problem suggests.

  The system in Problem 9 is an averager whose frequency response's zero crossings appear at just the right places to kill all the terms in the input's Fourier series.  Can you think of a similar system whose frequency response's zero crossings appear at just the right places to kill the even-indexed terms in the input's Fourier series?

  So do we work backwards from figuring out the zerocrossings of the frequency response to find the impulse response?

  Think carefully about the Problem 9 system and why the zero-crossings are where they are.  I'm not sure I can say more without completely giving away the answer and stealing from you the opportunity to come up with it yourself.  :-)
