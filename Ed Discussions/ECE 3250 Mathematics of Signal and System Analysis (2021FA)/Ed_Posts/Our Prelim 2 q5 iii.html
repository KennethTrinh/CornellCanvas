  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  why is prelim 2 q 5(iii) false? (the one with the grading error)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I thought it was an expression of
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  \left|v-\hat{v}\right|
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  and that this would be zero because the set is complete so v is its projection, so I thought that the square on the limit would not matter
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thank you!

  The limit doesn't necessarily exist unless $V$ is a Hilbert space, which the problem doesn't stipulate.
