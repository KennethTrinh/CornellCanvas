 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 why is prelim 2 q 5(iii) false? (the one with the grading error)
</p>
<p>
 I thought it was an expression of
</p>
<math>
 \left|v-\hat{v}\right|
</math>
<p>
 and that this would be zero because the set is complete so v is its projection, so I thought that the square on the limit would not matter
</p>
<p>
 Thank you!
</p>

  The limit doesn't necessarily exist unless $V$ is a Hilbert space, which the problem doesn't stipulate.
