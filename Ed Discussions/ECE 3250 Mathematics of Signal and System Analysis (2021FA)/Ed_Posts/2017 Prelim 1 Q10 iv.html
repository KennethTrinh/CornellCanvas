  How should I approach a question like this? So far I'm trying to work out what h may be. Because h(n)u(n) = 0 for all n in $\mathbb{Z}$, h must be equal to 0 for all n &gt;= 0. Thus, h can only be non-zero for n &lt; 0. How could I use this information to further work out this problem?

  $h$ is a nonzero signal that, as you observe, is zero for all $n \geq 0$,  Thus it violates the condition $h ( n ) = 0$ for all $n &lt; 0$, which condition is equivalent to causality.  Ergo system is non-causal.
