 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 When we did the lecture example of an H(z) with a (ROC) 3&lt;|z|&lt;4,  did we say this was not causal because of the 4 on the right side on the ROC, meaning that the ROC does not look like:
</p>
<p>
 Ra&lt;|z|&lt; infinity  ?  Can we always say that a system is not causal iff Rb does not equal infinity, and a system is causal iff Rb=infinity (assuming Ra is anything)?
</p>
<p>
 Also, we said that we were not able to tell if the system was BIBO stable - is this because the system isn't causal so we can't use the "poles less than 1" rule?
</p>
<p>
 Thank you!
</p>
