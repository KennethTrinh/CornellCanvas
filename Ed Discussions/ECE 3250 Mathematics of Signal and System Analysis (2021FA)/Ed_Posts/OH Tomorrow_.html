  Hi class!
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Not that I'd imagine many people would come the day after the Prelim, but I won't be able to host my usual office hours tomorrow morning because I'll be travelling to UPenn for a swim meet. Just like before, if you have any questions I'd be happy to answer them over email (idm23). Good luck today!
