  For i), If A is a proper subset of B, then how could the mapping f from A to B ever be surjective?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For ii), Doesn't this imply that f is injective?  Not sure how that is necessarily true.  The word "unique" throws me off in this statement.  Could you explain?

  See #75 for (i).
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  (ii) is just the definition of a mapping.

  Thanks for i), that makes sense now.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  As for ii) I'm still a little confused.  Would the word "unique" not imply that the mapping is injective?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If we define a mapping:
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  f:\ Z\ \rightarrow\ N\ where\ f\left(z\right)\ =\ \left|n\right|
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  then f(1) = 1 and f(-1) = 1.  Here we have an example where 1 isn't unique.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I guess what I'm trying to say is I don't get what "unique" means in this definition and when I was first doing the practice question, I assumed you were referring to some form of the injective definition.  Even after going back into the monograph I still don't understand why b, which is an element of B, has to be "unique" or what that even means in this case.

  How about substitute "exactly one" for "unique."  Does that help?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  In your absolute-value example, the 1 on the right-hand side is what's "unique."  1 is the unique thing to which 1 maps.  It's also the unique thing to which $- 1$maps.

  Got it, makes sense.  The "exactly one" definition helped.  Thank you!
