 In our list of criteria for existence of convolution, I am struggling to find a criteria that fits for e^n^2. I can see multiple criteria that x2 starts to satisfy, but x1 seems to make it so none of them fit. I might be missing something but should we be thinking of criteria beyond our non-exhaustive list?

  In that problem, the "helpful signal" criterion-wise isn't $e ^ {n ^ 2}$.
