 Since h is finite duration, we know that h*x exists. I don't know how to go from this step to proving that there must be a frequency response. Any hints?

  "System has a frequency response" is the same as saying "$x ( t ) = e ^ {j \Omega _ o t}$ is an admissible input to the system for every $\Omega _ o$."
 </p>

  That might help ....
