  1) In the solutions, how does the sum from 0 to infinity work out for (-1)^-k? Doesn't this diverge? I'm not entirely sure how all of those sums are equal.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2) How did the lower limit of summation go from minus infinity to 0? Obviously this makes sense when you break h(k) into (expression * u(k)), but that isn't done in these steps.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  3) How do you know to try d(n) = epsilon * (-1)^n? What is the thought process and is that the only equation that works?

  1. The $k$th term in the sum is $( - 1 ) ^ k h ( k )$, and $h \in l ^ 1$.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. Because $h ( k ) = 0$ for $k &lt; 0$.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  3. I played around with it .... kind of just knew to try something like that because $h$ alternates in sign, so if you want to get the biggest possible sum, you want an input that alternates in sign.  Something like that.
