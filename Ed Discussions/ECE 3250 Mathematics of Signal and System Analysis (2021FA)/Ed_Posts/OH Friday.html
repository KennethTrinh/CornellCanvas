  Hi class,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  This weekend I have our last meet of this year so I won't be able to host my usual office hours on Friday morning because I'll be in Akron, Ohio. To make up this loss of office hours I'll be hosting extra hours this Tuesday from 8pm to 9:30pm (same as my Monday Hours).
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Sincerely,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Ian Mackey

  Can an email be sent to the entire class because not many students check Ed on a regular basis?
