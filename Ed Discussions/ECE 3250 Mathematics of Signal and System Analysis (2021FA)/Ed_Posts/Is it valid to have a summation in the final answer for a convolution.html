  I probably should've asked this last week, but I kind of went with the flow and ignored it.  This is the second week I have this question, so I will ask away:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If I have a convolution that gives a result such as the following:
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  h\ \cdot\ x\left(n\right)\ =\ 0\ if\ n&lt;0\ or\ n\ &gt;\ 10\ else\ \sum_{k=0}^{10}92^{-k}
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  Would it be ok to keep the summation in the final answer?  Or should we write out the ugly number it gives as a result?

  I was hoping you could use geometric series to get rid of summation signs.  What problem is this from?
