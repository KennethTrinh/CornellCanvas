  For (a), many answers are possible --- you just need to make sure the chosen carrier frequencies are far enough apart so the shifted signal spectra don't "collide," plus you need those shifted spectra to fall in the channel passband.

   for part a i don't think he gave the aanswers since I think may answers are possible. For part b he put the signals next to the terminals, but that one also has other viable combinations.
