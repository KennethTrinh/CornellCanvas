  Hello, I had a couple questions on the Fall 2020 answer key:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For Q3(iv), I do not see why it is true.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I think the point of the question is that with Euler's theorem, k could equal $\phi(a)$ -- but since a&gt;p, I do not think we know for sure that p is an element of $Z_a^*$, because if a is a multiple of p, then a and p could not be coprime and the answer would always be zero, and we could not find such a k.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For Q2(iii), I do not think that set of numbers is periodic, so therefore it is not finite.  Also, I know each one evaluates to an irrational number like $\sqrt{2}/2$, but I thought you could still form a bijection from each natural number to each $e^{j2\pi/N}$ for each N.  So I thought it would be countably infinite.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For Q10, is (iv) correct?  I did not think it had a frequency response because I plugged in $e^{j\Omega t}$ and I didn't get (something)*the original x(t).  Is there a better way to check for this case?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For Q15, I thought (iv) was true.  Since the $y_c$ is decent I thought it has to be bounded on any closed interval, so it could only blow up as t goes to infinity.  However, since it must equal x(n) for y(nT) I thought this would maintain its boundedness.

  For 3iv) and 2(iii), you're totally correct --- these are the second and third mistakes people have uncovered on the Fall 2020 answers!  I must have had major pandemic fatigue last December!  (Well, I know I did --- being locked out of the Fitness Center for 9 months will do that!)

 <paragraph>
  10(iv) is indeed true.  Check your math to make sure you get it.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For 15(iv), think of something going up and down to higher and higher peaks between integer $t$-values as $t \rightarrow \infty$.
