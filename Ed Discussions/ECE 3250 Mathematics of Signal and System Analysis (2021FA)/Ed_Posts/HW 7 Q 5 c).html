 How are inner products defined for the $P_3$ polynomial subspace?
</p>
<p>
 Do we actually need to know the inner product of this subspace or do we just use our knowledge of inner products between vectors in an orthonormal set?
</p>

  To your first question, the inner product in (b) is the one to use in (c).  Not sure I understand your second question.
