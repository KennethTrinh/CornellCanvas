  This may be a simple question, but I am confused why 1 iv) is false. If A is finite, since
  <bold>
   N
  </bold>
  is an infinite set, shouldn't any mapping from
  <bold>
   N
  </bold>
  to A be surjective i.e. every A is mapped to by at least one n in
  <bold>
   N
  </bold>
  ? Or is this false because, while there exists a surjective mapping from
  <bold>
   N
  </bold>
  to A, we do not know if all mappings from
  <bold>
   N
  </bold>
  to A are surjective?

  I think a counterexample could be that A = {1,2} and we define the mapping from N to A to be f(n) = 1 for any n in N. Then nothing in N maps to 2, so it's not subjective
