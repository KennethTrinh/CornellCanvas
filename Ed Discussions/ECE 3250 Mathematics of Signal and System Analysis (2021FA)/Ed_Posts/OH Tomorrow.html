  Hi class,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Tomorrow I will be offering extended office hours starting from slightly later time than usual. Same room as always, from 11 to 1:30. If you can't make those hours but still have questions, as always, feel free to email me at idm23@cornell.edu if you have questions.

  Sincerely,
 </paragraph>
