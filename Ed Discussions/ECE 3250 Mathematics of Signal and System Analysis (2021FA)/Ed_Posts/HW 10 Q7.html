  After finding the N-point DFT's of x1 and x2, how can we find the ordinary convolution of the two signals? I am a little bit confused about the process for ordinary convolution vs. circular convolution using DFTs.

  Turns out that $y _ 1$, the ordinary convolution of $x _ 1$ and $x _ 2$ viewed as $N$-point signals, is the same as the circular convolution of those two $N$-point signals.  Thus you get $y _ 1$ by taking the inverse $N$-point DFT of

  $\left ( \widehat{Y} _ 1 \right ) _ k = \left ( \widehat{X} _ 1 \right ) _ k \left ( \widehat{X} _ 2 \right ) _ k$, $0 \leq k &lt; N$.

  Is there a simplified way to take the N-pt inverse DFT of $(

  ​$? Right now, it comes out to a very long and un-simplified summation?

  " Note that you can “read a signal off” from its N-point DFT if you’ve got the DFT expressed as a sum of powers ψ^−k for 0 ≤ k &lt; N — the coefficient of ψ^−nk in such an expression is the value of the signal at time n. "
