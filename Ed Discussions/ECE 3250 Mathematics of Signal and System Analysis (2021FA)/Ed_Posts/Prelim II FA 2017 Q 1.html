 I am having a hard time understanding the answers to this question. I would like to check my reasoning.
</p>
<p>
 For (i), I thought it was true because if $x \in D_{h_0}$, then any shifted x is also $\in D_{h_0}$. But I am not sure of this reasoning anymore.
</p>
<p>
 For (ii), I thought it was true because of Criterion 1 for continuous convolution. Is this false because $h_0$ was not explicitly stated to be a decent signal?
</p>
<p>
 edit: (ii) is true
</p>
<p>
 For (iii), I am assuming it is false because $h_0$ is a left-sided signal whilst x is a right-sided signal and there is no criterion explicitly guaranteeing that their convolution exists.
</p>
<p>
 For (iv), I am assuming it is false due to 8.5 Theorem because the t-shift is negative, so the system is actually using x(t + 3) to calculate x(t).

  For (i), your reasoning is correct.
 </p>
 <p>
  (ii) is true.  And $h _ 0$ is explicitly specified to be decent.  Are we looking at the same exam?
 </p>
 <p>
  Correct on (iii)
 </p>
 <p>
  Correct.on (iv).
