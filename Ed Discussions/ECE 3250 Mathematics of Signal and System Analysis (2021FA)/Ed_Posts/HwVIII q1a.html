  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I am a bit lost on how to do question1 on the new homework and was hoping for a hint.  x isn't an 'eigen input' and the expression gives the convolution of h and x for a specific x, so I am not sure to proceed.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thank you!

  The specific $x$ has a Fourier transform.    Can you apply the Convolution Rule along with the given info to figure out $\widehat{H} ( \Omega )$?

  Unless I have it wrong, would we also have to do a Fourier transform of the system S(x)(t)?

  Yeah, the signal $S ( x )$ --- you'll want to take its Fourier transform, as well.
