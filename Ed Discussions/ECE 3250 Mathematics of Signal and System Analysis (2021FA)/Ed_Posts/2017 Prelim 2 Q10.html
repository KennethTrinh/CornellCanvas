  For part b, how is the output for the first system just -13? Does it have to do with the fundamental frequency of the system? I'm having trouble figuring out how to approach this without plugging the given x(t) into the integral for S(x)(t)

  The first system is an averager and is supposed to look familiar to you.  The sine and cosine terms all average to zero over any interval of length that's a multiple of 7.
