  Q4 on both exams confused me overall.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For 2017:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  How do I approach (iii)?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I don't understand why (iv) is true. I know that (p-1) is not a divisor of ed since p-1 is coprime with both e and d. But I don't see how that leads me to conclude that p is coprime with both e and d.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For 2020:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Why is part (i) true? I know that e and d individually are coprime with p - 1 and that ed = l(p-1) + 1 for some integer l, but how does that imply that e is coprime with p?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I think part (ii) is true because p|2^e and/or p|7^d if p|2^e*7^d. We know that p is odd since it is a prime &gt; 2, so it cannot divide 2^e. I'm assuming since 7 is a prime, if p|7^d, then p must also be 7.

  To your first question: $p$ is coprimbe with every integer below it except 0.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  To the second, for $p$ to divide that product, it has to be 2 or 7 by uniqueness of prime factorizations.  Since $p$ is odd, it hast to be 7.

  I think I understand the reasoning for (ii) but I am still a little confused by what you mean by “uniqueness of prime factorizations”. Are you basically saying that a prime number ^ anything is only divisible by itself?

  The only prime divisors of a product of prime powers are the primes appearing in the product.  This follows from the old if $p | a b$ then $p | a$ or $p | b$ or both thing.
