 I'm not sure how ii and iv are different here. I tried to justify ii being false by saying that BIBO stability implies that h converges to 0 as n goes to +- infinity, but that h converging to 0 as n goes to +- infinity does not necessarily imply BIBO stability?
</p>
<p>
 But then for iv, I justified it being true by saying that it converges to 0 for n going to +- infinity, so I'm not sure why ii is false while iv is true.

  Converging to zero as $n \rightarrow \pm  \infty$ isn't enogh --- you need absolute summability, which is true in (iv) but not necessarily in (ii).
