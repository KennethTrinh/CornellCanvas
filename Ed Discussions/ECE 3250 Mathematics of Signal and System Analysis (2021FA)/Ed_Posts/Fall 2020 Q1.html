 I looked at a previous answer to this, and I don't think I understood the response. From my understanding surjectiive mapping means all the elements in B are mapped to at least once. But the statement under iv) seems to be like the exact statement that iii) in Fall 2017 and that one was an injective mapping.
</p>
<p>
 Additionally for this same question, does surjectivity in the case where f: A -&gt; B is a surjective mapping mean card(B) &lt;= card(A) and injectivity mapping would mean Card(A) &lt;= Card(B)?

  Yes to your second question.
 </p>
 <p>
  The statement in (iv) is the definition of a mapping --- period.  Every $a$ in $A$ goes somewhere in $B$.

   so iv) just defines in general what mapping is, not specifics or characteristics of a subjective or injective mapping.

    Correct.  (iv) says, "$f$ is a mapping."
