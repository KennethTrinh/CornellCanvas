  I looked at a previous answer to this, and I don't think I understood the response. From my understanding surjectiive mapping means all the elements in B are mapped to at least once. But the statement under iv) seems to be like the exact statement that iii) in Fall 2017 and that one was an injective mapping.

  Additionally for this same question, does surjectivity in the case where f: A -&gt; B is a surjective mapping mean card(B) &lt;= card(A) and injectivity mapping would mean Card(A) &lt;= Card(B)?

  Yes to your second question.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The statement in (iv) is the definition of a mapping --- period.  Every $a$ in $A$ goes somewhere in $B$.

  so iv) just defines in general what mapping is, not specifics or characteristics of a subjective or injective mapping.

  Correct.  (iv) says, "$f$ is a mapping."
