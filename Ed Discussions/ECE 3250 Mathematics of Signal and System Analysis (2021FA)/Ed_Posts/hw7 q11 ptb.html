  To show that this equation holds, is it enough to take the derivative of both sides and see that the derivative relationship holds?

  As for deriving the actual equation, I'm not too sure how to start. I tried solving the differential equation $\hat{X}(\Omega) = -\int \Omega \hat{X}(\Omega) d\Omega$ but this seems like the wrong path. Thanks!

  Yes to your first question (technically because of Existence and Uniqueness Theorem for ODEs).

  To your second comment, it's just what they call a separable differential equation.  Like

 <paragraph>
  $\frac{{\rm d} f}{f} = - t d t$ implies $\ln f - \ln f ( 0 ) = - \frac{t ^ 2}{2}$ and the rest is history.
