 Are there any tips for how to start this question? I don't really know how the g we are supposed to find would be any different from the given sinc function for g in the problem

  You're supposed to use (b) to find $g$ for the linear $T$-interpolation: $g$ will be the linear $T$-interpolation of $\delta$.
