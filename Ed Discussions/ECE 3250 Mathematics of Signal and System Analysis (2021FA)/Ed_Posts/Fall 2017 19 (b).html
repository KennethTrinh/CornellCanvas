 I am confused about how to calculate the sampling frequency of the signals. For example, if terminal 1 is x_1 and terminal 2 is x_2, is the sampling time for x_1 the sum of the time spent in terminal one and the time spent in the switching?

  It's the time between the middle of one sample of a signal and the middle of the next sample of that same signal.
