  When we talked about TDMA in lecture, we said that the wait time between consecutive pulse samples of all x's must be small enough, i.e.
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  T&lt;\frac{\pi}{\Omega_m^{\ast}}
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  My first question is, can T be equal to this value, or must it be less than?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Secondly, where does this result come from? Is it the same thing as stipulating that each x signal be sampled above its Nyquist rate to prevent aliasing?

  $T$ is supposed to be strictly less than that, but it can be arbitrarily close, and, Yes, that result comes from the stipulation you cite.
