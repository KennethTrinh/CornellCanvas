 From what I understand, bandlimited is in the frequency domain while finite duration is in the time domain? Is there any relationship between them?

  If you are finite duration in the time domain, then you can't have bandlimiitedness in the frequency domain. One example that I just keep in mind is the "boxcar" or the pulse function in the time domain, whose fourier spectrum is a sinc which clearly isn't necessarily ceterered around certain frequencies and applies over every frequency value possible.
