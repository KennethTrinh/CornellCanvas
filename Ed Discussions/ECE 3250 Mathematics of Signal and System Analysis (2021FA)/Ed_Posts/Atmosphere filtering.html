 In lecture it was mentioned that the atmosphere behaves as a high pass filter, why is this the case?

  Physics that I don't know a lot about. I've just always heard, "The atmosphere lets through a lot of visible light, but it filters out a lot of infrared, which is lower-frequency EMR.  Meanwhile, it lets through more ultraviolet, which is higher-frequency EMR --- and X-rays, and cosmic rays, as well."
