 <paragraph>
  The monograph says "the question of whether a signal x has a DTFT is equivalent to the question of whether x’s values constitute the set of Fourier-series coefficients for some 2π-periodic function of ω".
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I don't get how y has DTFT in this case based on the monograph.

  Could you explain 5(ii)?

  This probably doesn't answer your question about the statement in the monograph, but I think the DTFT function holds for any discrete-time finite duration signal. And the signal in 5.2 has finite duration?

  Every finite-duration discrete-time signal has a DTFT and equation $\mathcal{DTFT}$ holds.
