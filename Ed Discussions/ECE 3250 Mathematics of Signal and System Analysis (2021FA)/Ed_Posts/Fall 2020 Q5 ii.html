 The monograph says "the question of whether a signal x has a DTFT is equivalent to the question of whether x’s values constitute the set of Fourier-series coefficients for some 2π-periodic function of ω".
</p>
<p>
 I don't get how y has DTFT in this case based on the monograph.

<p>
 Could you explain 5(ii)?

  This probably doesn't answer your question about the statement in the monograph, but I think the DTFT function holds for any discrete-time finite duration signal. And the signal in 5.2 has finite duration?

  Every finite-duration discrete-time signal has a DTFT and equation $\mathcal{DTFT}$ holds.
