  How simplified is our answer for 6 c) expected to be? I do not know n, so I have it in terms of two summations from m = 0 to m = n and from m = n + 1 to m = 4.

  I would say just a list of the numerical values of $y ( n )$ for $0 \leq n &lt; 5$ --- I think you can pretty easily calculate those because the signals are so simple.
