 iii) Why is there false? I think both are right-sided signals, the x1 * x2 should exist? but I'm not sure why this is bounded or not

  You're right that the convolution exists, but there's nothing preventing it from being unbounded. x1 and x2 can be any discrete-time signals that are 0 for n &lt; 0. (eg: x1 is the unit step, and x2 blows up to infinity as n-&gt; infinity)
