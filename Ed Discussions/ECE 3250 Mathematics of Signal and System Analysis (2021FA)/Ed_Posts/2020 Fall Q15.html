 iii) Is there an Omega_0 for this statement to be true and why?
</p>
<p>
 iv) What will be a counterexample for this? Or a general reason for why this is false?

  Also, based on the definition for T-interpolation, is it true to say that y_c only has to satisfy y_c(nT) = x(n) and there are no other constraints?

  Correct to your second quesiton.  To the first question on (iii), $T _ o$-interpolations need not be periodic, so they need not have Fourier series.  For (iv), think of something that hits all the required samples but oscillates higher and higher between them as $t \rightarrow \infty$.
