 I'm a bit confused on this problem, this is my reasoning so far:
</p>
<p>
 (i) By definition 9.12 in monograph
</p>
<p>
 (ii) -Not sure what to use to prove this is true
</p>
<p>
 (iii) Also by definition in monograph
</p>
<p>
 (iv) The index
 <code>
  k = 5
 </code>
 can be excluded since
 <code>
  &lt; v, w_5 &gt; = 0
 </code>
 so it will not affect the summation. But, the summation starts at
 <code>
  k = 0
 </code>
 instead of
 <code>
  k = -5
 </code>
 so the statement becomes false.
</p>
<p>
 Just to clarify for parts (iii) and (iv) are we supposed to assume the following?
</p>
<math>
 v\in V
</math>

  For (ii), we've noted several times, and so does the monograph, that the indicated sum is $\| v \| ^ 2$.  Your reasoning is correct for the other parts, and yes, $v \in V$ throughout.
