  I'm a bit confused on this problem, this is my reasoning so far:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  (i) By definition 9.12 in monograph
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  (ii) -Not sure what to use to prove this is true
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  (iii) Also by definition in monograph
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  (iv) The index
  <code>
   k = 5
  </code>
  can be excluded since
  <code>
   &lt; v, w_5 &gt; = 0
  </code>
  so it will not affect the summation. But, the summation starts at
  <code>
   k = 0
  </code>
  instead of
  <code>
   k = -5
  </code>
  so the statement becomes false.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Just to clarify for parts (iii) and (iv) are we supposed to assume the following?
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  v\in V
 </math>

  For (ii), we've noted several times, and so does the monograph, that the indicated sum is $\| v \| ^ 2$.  Your reasoning is correct for the other parts, and yes, $v \in V$ throughout.
