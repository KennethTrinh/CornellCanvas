<p>
 Or should we consider that we might work with a metric space that is Cauchy but not convergent in this course?

  Short answer Yes, we work only with complete metric spaces, but more to the point the only metric spaces we deal with are specific spaces of signals, and they're all not just metric spaces but normed vector spaces, sometimes even inner product spaces.
