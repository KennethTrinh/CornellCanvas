  Since the FA2020 solutions didn't include reasons, I just wanted to make sure my thought process for these particular questions is correct:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  3)iv) is false because it's actually $7$, not $1$.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  4)i) EDIT: misread this one, it's about $e$ and $p$, not $e$ and $d$.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  5)iv) is true because an "unbounded" set could still have an upper bound as long as it doesn't have a lower bound, so the elements of $D$ could be in $(-\infty,$ inf$(A)-\epsilon]$ for some $\epsilon &gt; 0$
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  6)iii) is false because a sequence $s_n$ which never goes above $6$ also satisfies $3 \leq s_n \leq 7$
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  6)iv) is true because $s_n$ is monotonically increasing and bounded from above
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  8)ii) is false because one of $x_!$ and $x_2$ could be finite while the other is unbounded
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  9)iv) is true because $h$ is finite duration, so $S(h)$ is finite duration because the convolution of two finite duration signals is finite duration, and $S(h) * S(h)$ is finite duration for the same reason (and hence right sided)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  10)iv) is not causal because $S(\delta )(n&lt;0) \propto \sum_{k=-(M-1)}^{M+1} \delta (n-k)$ is nonzero when $n+M-1=0 \Rightarrow M=1-n$ which satisfies the $M&gt;1$ condition $\forall n&lt;0$.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>

  Sorry for all the questions- I just want to make sure I understand the 'why' behind all these answers. Thanks!

  It's hard for me to answer all these on one screen (I need the test side-by-side), but for now, 4(i) is actually true --- it's about the coprimeness of $e$ and $p$, not $e$ and $d$.  See #69.

 <paragraph>
  I hope to answer the rest of your questions tomorrow --- maybe others in the class can help.  :-)

  In 8(ii), neither signal needs to be bounded.  E.g. two unbounded right-sided signals, like $x _ 1 ( n ) = 3 ^ n u ( n )$ and $x _ 2 ( n ) = 7 ^ n u ( n )$.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  In 10(iv), $y ( n )$ depends explicitly on $x ( m )$ for $n + 1 \leq m &lt; n + ( M - 1 )$ is a clean way to see non-causality.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Reasoning in all the others is fine.
