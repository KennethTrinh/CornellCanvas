  I am confused on how to do block convolution. I have rewritten $y_2(n)$ as:
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  \sum_{r=-\infty}^{\infty}Shift_{rL}\left(x_1*\left(x_3\right)_r\right)
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  I do not know where to go from here.

  The individual terms in the series have finite duration, and each term's support interval overlaps only its adjacent terms.  You need to "sum on the overlaps."  Try drawing a picture with duration intervals of the terms to see how this works.
