  For this one for the dot products, do we invoke the integral definition of the dot product and range the integral limits in terms of n?

  The inner product is the usual one on $L ^ 2$, i.e. the "integral definition" as you put it.  The integrals all range from $- \infty$ to $\infty$ but will have "actual" limits far smaller because all the $\phi$'s and stuff are nonzero only over small intervals.
