 I don't really understand what the 8th and 9th bullet points are trying to say. How can y_r(t) become x_c(t)

  I think y_R(t) is the signal recovered from y, and y is a discrete-time signal we got by sampling x_c with T_2. The relation between x and y is just that x = x_c(nT_1) and y = x_c(nT_2) = x_c(3nT_1)

  $y$ is the same as $x$ sampled every $3 T _ 1$.  Please see #340 for more.
