  For this question, I'm not sure how to carry on after using the equation to find the vector in W that is "closest to x". I tried expanding it and wanted to simplify it but get my first equation again..

  Can you find an orthonormal basis for the subspace $W$?  if so, you can use the usual formula for the orthogonal projection of $x$ onto $W$.

  Ah yes that's the equation I was referring to. Do I just leave it in that form?

  Well, you'll have explicit formulas for the inner products of $x$ with the orthonormal basis signals and explicit formulas for those signals, so your final answer won't look much like the general formulas we've seem.

  Hmm I see. I expanded the inner product using the period given to us and was trying to simplify it but could only think about simplifying it back to the inner product since we're supposed to keep the answer in terms of x (and im not sure if we can integrate it since we don't know x). Is it correct to leave the answer in integral form?

  Yeah, your answer can have integrals.
