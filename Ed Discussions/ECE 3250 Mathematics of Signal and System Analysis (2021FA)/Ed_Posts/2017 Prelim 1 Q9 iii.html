  Intuitively we can have a non-finite x and have S(x) be finite, but what's the proof behind it?

  What do you mean by "non-finite"?

  Edit: just noticed what question you were asking about, so you're talking about duration.  How about this: $x$ alternates between $\pm 1$ and the system is a 2-fold averager?  $S ( x )$ is the zero signal.

  I meant that it is not finite, or rather it is infinite duration
