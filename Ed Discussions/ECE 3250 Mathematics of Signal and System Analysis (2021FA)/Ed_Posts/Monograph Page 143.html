 Is the phrase 'make it so' a sneaky reference to Captain Picard?

  I thought of him when I wrote that, and I put the phrase in quotes sort of in deference to him, but I didn't mean to sneak in a DS-9 allusion or anything.

  BTW a few years ago I saw an amazing play in NY with a 4-person cast --- Harold Pinter's "No Man's Land" --- and the two leads were Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen.  Amazing to watch those two play off each other.
