  I had a few questions on the 2017 finals:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1) iv) Why is this statement not true. Since A is finite, won't even every element get mapped to
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2) i) can you explain why this is false.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  3) why is ii) true and iii) false. Couldn't k easily be the size of Z*_a and then you could use Eulers theorem to confirm this fact. If its not the case, could you provide a simple counterexample to prove that its false
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  8) why is iv) true
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  10) How can I tell that this is time invariant?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  13) why is iii) false
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  15) I get why ii) is true, but why is i) true and if i) is true why wouldn't iii) be true as well since that's just the Fourier Approximation

  3.3) I'm not sure about this one, but I think in Euler's theorem, p and a needs to be coprime, but this may not be the case here?  I don't know if this is a valid counterexample, but if p = a = some prime, then the remainder will always be 0?

  13)iii) i said this was false because h(n) is right sided (since the ROC of H is upperbounded by infinity), and the convolution between a right and left sided signal isn't necessarily defined. if you work out the convolution, there's a $\Sigma_{k=n+1} ^{\infty} (\frac{1}{5})^{n-k}$ term that doesn't converge
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  15) i) is true because the discrete time samples are periodic and can be interpolated by a periodic signal. but i think (iii) is false because the interpolation of the discrete time samples need not be periodic- it can do anything in between the discrete time samples. since it's not necessarily periodic, it doesn't have a fourier series

  1) A mapping from the naturals to set A can be surjective but
  <italic>
   every
  </italic>
  mapping doesn't necessarily have to be. For example f(x) = 2 goes from all the naturals to just one value (not surjective). A mapping doesn't have to "hit" every value in the set A to be a mapping.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2) The question specifies the set of all
  <italic>
   irrational
  </italic>
  numbers between -1 and 1 which are uncountable. Rationals and Integers are countably infinite, irrationals are infinite just not countable.
