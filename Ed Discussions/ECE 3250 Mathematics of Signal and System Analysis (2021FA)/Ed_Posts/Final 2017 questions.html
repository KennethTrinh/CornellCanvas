 I had a few questions on the 2017 finals:
</p>
<p>
 1) iv) Why is this statement not true. Since A is finite, won't even every element get mapped to
</p>
<p>
 2) i) can you explain why this is false.
</p>
<p>
 3) why is ii) true and iii) false. Couldn't k easily be the size of Z*_a and then you could use Eulers theorem to confirm this fact. If its not the case, could you provide a simple counterexample to prove that its false
</p>
<p>
 8) why is iv) true
</p>
<p>
 10) How can I tell that this is time invariant?
</p>
<p>
 13) why is iii) false
</p>
<p>
 15) I get why ii) is true, but why is i) true and if i) is true why wouldn't iii) be true as well since that's just the Fourier Approximation

  13)iii) i said this was false because h(n) is right sided (since the ROC of H is upperbounded by infinity), and the convolution between a right and left sided signal isn't necessarily defined. if you work out the convolution, there's a $\Sigma_{k=n+1} ^{\infty} (\frac{1}{5})^{n-k}$ term that doesn't converge
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  15) i) is true because the discrete time samples are periodic and can be interpolated by a periodic signal. but i think (iii) is false because the interpolation of the discrete time samples need not be periodic- it can do anything in between the discrete time samples. since it's not necessarily periodic, it doesn't have a fourier series

   3.3) I'm not sure about this one, but I think in Euler's theorem, p and a needs to be coprime, but this may not be the case here?  I don't know if this is a valid counterexample, but if p = a = some prime, then the remainder will always be 0?

  1) A mapping from the naturals to set A can be surjective but
  <i>
   every
  </i>
  mapping doesn't necessarily have to be. For example f(x) = 2 goes from all the naturals to just one value (not surjective). A mapping doesn't have to "hit" every value in the set A to be a mapping.
 </p>
 <p>
  2) The question specifies the set of all
  <i>
   irrational
  </i>
  numbers between -1 and 1 which are uncountable. Rationals and Integers are countably infinite, irrationals are infinite just not countable.
