 I am confused about why (i) is false here. In this question, I think {xn} is a two-sided sequence and as the sequence is monotonically increasing and bounded from above, lim Xn should be sup({Xn}), which is pi in this case. Why this is false? Thanks in advance.

  $\pi$ isn't necessarily the sup.  The sup could be, for example, --- it just has to be $\leq \pi$.
