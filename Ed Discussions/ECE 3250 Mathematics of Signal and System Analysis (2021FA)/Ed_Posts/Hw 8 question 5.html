  I don't really understand what thr question is asking?. Do I find the Y hat and integrate to find y(t) and subtract the the frequency response part? Not to sure what part a expects.

  Suggestion: express $y ( t )$ as a convolution first, with $h$ appearing somehow, and subtract off the frequency-response part, which you can also express as an integral if you want (so you're subtracting one integral from another, and the integrals turn out to have the same integrands).

  When I did thr convolution with just h(t) I got an integral from negative infinity to t. So do I just subtract out the frequency response part?

  Yeah ... two integrals, same integrand, different intervals.
