 How do the sine terms average to 0? Does this still hold if pi is multiplied by k -- sin((k*pi)*t/3)?

  There's supposed to be a $k$ in there --- yet another mistake on that test that I'm discovering only now.  And yeah, they all average to zero.  Reason: the fundamental period of $\sin ( k ( 2 \pi / 6 ) t )$ is $6 / k$, so integrating over an interval of length 6 kills all those terms because that interval contains an integer number of periods over which the sine averages to zero.
