 I thought that the signal is a pure sinusoid so it is not bandlimited, but from the monograph it seems like xc must be bandlimited in order to construct Xc-hat and X-hat? I'm not really sure how to get Xc-hat and then X-hat from there.

  A single pure sinusoid of frequency $\Omega _ o$ is bandlimited, and its bandwidth is $| \Omega _ o |$.
