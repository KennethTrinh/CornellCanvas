 <paragraph>
  (1) in $\mathbb{N}, \mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Q}$, is there a notion of a "cauchy" sequence? if there is, does it tell us anything about whether or not the sequence converges?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  (2) is there a notion of a "cauchy" sequence in the set of all irrationals?

  (2) Yeah, same definition as in rationals and reals.
