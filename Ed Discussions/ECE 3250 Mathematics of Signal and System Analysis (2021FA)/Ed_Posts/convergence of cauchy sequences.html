 (1) in $\mathbb{N}, \mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Q}$, is there a notion of a "cauchy" sequence? if there is, does it tell us anything about whether or not the sequence converges?
</p>
<p>
 (2) is there a notion of a "cauchy" sequence in the set of all irrationals?

  (1) In $\mathbb{Q}$ there is, and it might not converge to a rational number.

  (2) Yeah, same definition as in rationals and reals.
