 I maybe doing something wrong, but for summation notations where the sum does not start at 0, can we leave it in the sigma notation or is there a way to simplify it?

  You can usually simplify, but the problem doesn't demand that you do.  Example:
 </p>
 <p>
  $\sum _ {k = 1} ^ \infty \gamma ^ k = \frac{1}{1 - \gamma} - 1 = \frac{\gamma}{1 - \gamma}$
 </p>
 <p>
  when $| \gamma | &lt; 1$.
