  What does the shift function do in the general equation for convolutions
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  What does the shift Tk(x) * dk add to the h*x formula?

  I think most strictly convolutional systems can be written as h = h_0, but i think many cont. time systems do have that added shift sigma. From what I understand, that's just kinda added on at the end and really as for condition wise kinda only plays a role when causality for the time shifts.

  Hard to see exactly what you're asking, but we want to allow our LTI systems to include the identity system and the pure $t _ 1$-shift system, which is why our standing assumption allows a system to operate on an input by
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  = convolving the input with a decent signal $h _ 0$, and then
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  = adding on some shifts of the input
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  That's just the general form of LTI systems we consider in this course.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  When write out the system's impulse response, the shift terms, if any, contribute impulses.
