  why are 6)i,ii,iii) true?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If $q_n = \{5,-1,1,-1,1,-1,1....\}$ repeating an infinite sequence of $1,-1$, then it is still true that $s_n \in [3,7] \forall n \in \mathbb{N}$. But then $s_n$ oscillates around $4$ and $5$ so its limit as $n \to \infty$ cannot exist.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The $q_n$ chosen above is a sequence of nonzero rational numbers, and it isn't cauchy, and thus not summable. What am I missing?

  No, $s _ n$ uses absolute values.  I'll stop there and let you rephrase ....

  Oops, sorry, that makes sense. However, isn't the $q_n$ above not cauchy and therefore not summable?

  $\{ q _ n \}$ above is neither a Cauchy sequence nor a summable sequence, but those two properties are kind of independent.

  So just to clarify, since $q_n$ is a sequence of nonzero rational numbers, are i) and ii) false?

  That's not why they're false.  (i) is false because the limit could be less than $\pi$.  (ii) is false because the limit could be $- \pi$.

  Sorry, I meant this for question 6 on FA2017. The solution key lists i and ii as true, but I thought the $q_n$ I crafted above shows that i and ii are false.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The only explanation I can think of is that $q_n$ is not a valid sequence for this problem, but since it is a sequence of nonzero rational numbers, im having trouble understanding why this $q_n$ isnâ€™t sufficient in proving i and ii false.

  Nvm I see now, the sequence I gave wasn't absolutely summable. Sorry about that! i see why they're true now
