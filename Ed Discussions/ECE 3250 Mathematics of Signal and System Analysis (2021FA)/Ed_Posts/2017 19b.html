 What are the carrier frequencies in 19)a)? I couldn't find them in the solutions key

 Does the second condition in 19)b) include the first condition? That is, are x1, x3 sampled every .0008 seconds and x2 sampled every .0004 seconds? Thanks!

  Many correct answers for carrier frequencies --- they just have to be far enough apart so the shifted spectra don't collide.

  I don't understand your question about 19(b).
