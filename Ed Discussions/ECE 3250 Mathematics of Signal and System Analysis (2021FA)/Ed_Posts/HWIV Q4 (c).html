  Hi, In HW4 I am pretty sure that the (c) system S(x)(n)=x(3n) cannot be causal because it depends on future values of x(n); for ex S(x)(1) = x(3) which is a future value of x(n)

  however the impulse response h = delta(3n) seems to follow h(n)=0 for n&lt;0 so I am not sure how to rectify my understanding.

  Turns out the system isn't time-invariant, so the $h ( n ) = 0$ for $n &lt; 0$ thing doesn't apply.
