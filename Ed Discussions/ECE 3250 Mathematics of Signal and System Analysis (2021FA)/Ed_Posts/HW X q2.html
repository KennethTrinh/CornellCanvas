  Hello,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The complete orthonormal set in terms of the scaling function makes sense to me as in the second bullet.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Does the Haar wavelets n,k also form a complete orthonormal set in Vk?  In my notes I have it forming an orthonormal basis for L2, but part c of this question loooks like it is forming a basis for Vk?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  do we do the projection on Vk in terms of the scaled and shifted scaling function or in terms of the scale and shifted mother wavelet?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thank you!

  It turns out that for every $k$, the Haar wavelets $\psi _ {n , m }$ for all $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ and all $m &lt; k$ form a complete orthonormal set in $V _ k$.  We didn't penetrate the theory deeply enough to get to that.

 <paragraph>
  For projection onto the $V _ k$, please use the scaled and shifted scaling function.
