 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 For 6d, DFT Yk, if I multiply I am left with a bunch of terms like:
</p>
<math>
 \psi_5^{-nk}
</math>
<p>
 I know that Yk will actually be a 9 point signal which makes sense because I get terms up to n=8, but should I instead be working with N=9 on all of the above terms?  I am not sure how to do that if so.
</p>
<p>
 I am also not sure how to use the other part of the hint or where it comes in:
</p>
<math>
 \psi_N^N=1
</math>
<p>
 Thank you!
</p>

  $y$ is a 5-point signal --- it's the 5-point
  <i>
   circular
  </i>
  convolution of $x _ 1$ and $x _ 2$, not the
  <i>
   ordinary
  </i>
  convolution.

   Ah that makes sense to me now, the fact that the answer should then turn out as 5 point.
  </p>
  <p>
   My other question still holds then, because when multiplying the two signals' DFTs I am getting terms up to n=8.

    Sorry for slow reply --- I've been driving.  If you get something like $\psi _ 5 ^ {7 k}$, that's the same as $\psi _ 5 ^ {2 k}$ because $\psi _ 5 ^ {5 k} = 1$.
