  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For 6d, DFT Yk, if I multiply I am left with a bunch of terms like:
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  \psi_5^{-nk}
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  I know that Yk will actually be a 9 point signal which makes sense because I get terms up to n=8, but should I instead be working with N=9 on all of the above terms?  I am not sure how to do that if so.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I am also not sure how to use the other part of the hint or where it comes in:
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  \psi_N^N=1
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  Thank you!

  $y$ is a 5-point signal --- it's the 5-point
  <italic>
   circular
  </italic>
  convolution of $x _ 1$ and $x _ 2$, not the
  <italic>
   ordinary
  </italic>
  convolution.

  Ah that makes sense to me now, the fact that the answer should then turn out as 5 point.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  My other question still holds then, because when multiplying the two signals' DFTs I am getting terms up to n=8.

  Sorry for slow reply --- I've been driving.  If you get something like $\psi _ 5 ^ {7 k}$, that's the same as $\psi _ 5 ^ {2 k}$ because $\psi _ 5 ^ {5 k} = 1$.
