 What is the difference between a vector space and a subspace?

  Let $V$ be a vector space.  $W$ is a subspace of $V$ when $W$ is a subset of $V$ that's closed under linear combos taken according to the linear combo rules in $V$.  Thus a subspace is a vector space itself with vector operations "inherited from $V$," as mathematicians say.

   So could I say that a vector space is a set of objects/"vectors" that can be linearly combined and a subspace is a vector space that is a subset of another vector space?

    You could say that.  Note that if $V$ is a vector space, $V$ and $\{ 0 \}$ are both subspaces of $V$, where $0$ is the zero vector in $V$.  Thus every vector space is a subspace of itself.

     Additional comment: you never say "$W$ is a subspace" just by itself --- you always say "$W$ is a subspace of $V$."  Like, you don't say something's a subspace without saying what it's a subspace of.
