 Hello,  I am trying to understand how we got the impulse response for the averager in continuous time.

 I am thinking that as a-&gt;0 the pulse of width a is essentially just a value of 1 at t=0.  So, if t-T&lt;0&lt;t, thinking of the integral as a reimann sum, the range that we are summing has 0 in the middle of it, then this 1 shows up in the sum and thus we get the (1/T)*(1).  if t&gt;T then won't have t=0 in our integral so we get zero, and if t&lt;0 we won't have that t=0 point in it either.

</p>
<p>
 I am not sure how to get the value at the jump with the 1/2 * (1/T). By my logic, if t=0, the 1 would then be in the interval we are summing, so we would get (1/T).
</p>
<p>
 How would you do this integral more rigorously without just reasoning about it?  I know that I have to change the integral bounds to involve the (-a/2 to a/2) range but I am confused how to deal with adding them in with all the ts and Ts going on.
</p>
<p>
 Thanks in advance

  One idea: plug in $t = 0$ and the formula for $p _ a$ and you end up with
 </p>
 <p>
  $\frac{1}{a T} \int _ {- T} ^ 0 p _ a ( \tau ) d \tau$,
 </p>
 <p>
  which, for $a$ small enough (specifically, $a &lt; T / 2$) equals
 </p>
 <p>
  $\frac{1}{a T} \int _ {- a / 2} ^ 0 1 d \tau = \frac{1}{a T} ( a / 2 ) = \frac{1}{2 T}$.
 </p>
 <p>
  You can calculate the $t = T$ case similarly.
