 Will we be allowed calculators on the exam? There are some operations of z-transforms that are made much easier with a Ti-84.

  I've always allowed calculators on exams, and I guess I'll allow them this semester, as well, but I know calculators' capabilities have expanded sufficiently so I need to re-think it.
