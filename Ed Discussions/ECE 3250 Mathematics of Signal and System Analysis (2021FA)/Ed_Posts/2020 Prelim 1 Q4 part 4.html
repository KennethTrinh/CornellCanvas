  I said that this one is false, but I'm not sure if my reasoning is correct. I said that since mod p-1  (ed) is 1, then mod p (ed) is zero. So mod p (m^ed) = mod p (m^0) = mod p (1). Since m is defined to be greater than 1, the statement must be false.

  Is it correct to assume that mod p (ed) =0 if mod p-1 (ed) = 1?
