 I was struggling with question 5 on the homework and so any help would be great. Not really sure where to start despite the hint, unfortunately.

  Can you get any of the "Why?" questions?

   The part that I am stuck on is the one where we assume k has a multiplicative inverse l, before and after that I was able to understand. the part before with the common multiple i assume arises from k's coprimeness with a.

    We have $\langle k q \rangle _ a = 0$.  Now multiply by $l$ and mod out by $a$, and I think you get $\langle q \rangle _ a = 0$.  And $q = \langle q \rangle _ a$.
