 How do you determine if a signal is closed under time-shifting? Is there a formula or thought process to make this conclusion?
</p>
<p>
 Also, the meaning of the word "closed"
</p>
<p>
 Thanks.

  A set of signals, not an individual signal, can be closed under shifting, which means: if a signal is a member of the set, all its time-shifts are also members of the set.  Classic example: the set of all finite-duration signals.  You shift a finite-duration signal, and the result is still a finite-duration signal.
