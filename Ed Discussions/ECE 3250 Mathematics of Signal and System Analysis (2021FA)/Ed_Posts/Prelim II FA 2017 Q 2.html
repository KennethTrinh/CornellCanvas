  I would like to check my reasoning for question 2:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  (i) is false because h(t) $\notin L^1$.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  (ii) is true because a decent, finite duration signal is absolutely integrable, so h(t) $\in L^1$.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  (iii) is false because Criterion 1 guarantees that h*x exists, but not that it is finite duration.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  (iv) is false because you need to multiply the RHS by the $L^1$-norm of h(t) for the Criterion 3 inequality to apply.
