 Hi I'm confused as to why
</p>
<p>
 (ii)
 <i>
  The set of all decent continuous-time periodic signals that have fundamental period 19 and equal zero at t =0
 </i>
</p>
<p>
 is not closed under finite linear combinations?  I thought the set of all complex-valued decent signals with T_0 as a period was closed under linear combinations and therefore a vector space of signals.

  The key word that makes it false is is
  <i>
   fundamental
  </i>
  .  Any set of signals closed under linear combos has to contain the zero signal.
