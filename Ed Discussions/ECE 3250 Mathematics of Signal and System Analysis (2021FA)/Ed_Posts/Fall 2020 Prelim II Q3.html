  Hi I'm confused as to why
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  (ii)
  <italic>
   The set of all decent continuous-time periodic signals that have fundamental period 19 and equal zero at t =0
  </italic>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  is not closed under finite linear combinations?  I thought the set of all complex-valued decent signals with T_0 as a period was closed under linear combinations and therefore a vector space of signals.

  The key word that makes it false is is
  <italic>
   fundamental
  </italic>
  .  Any set of signals closed under linear combos has to contain the zero signal.
