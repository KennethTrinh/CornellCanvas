 For part c, I am not completely sure what the question is asking. Is it asking to prove q_n+1 = 1 + 1/q_n or that the q_n converges to the golden ratio or both? Also for the golden ratio, it says that part b) should help arrive to that conclusion but doesn't b just tell you x_n+1 also converges to a similar value.

  Both, kind of, but not totally.  First show that the recursion holds.  Then, assuming that $\{ q _ n \}$ converges, show that it converges to the golden ratio --- the result of (b) helps.  The key here: we assume $\{ q _ n \}$ converges, but don't prove it --- all we do is find out what it converges to given that it converges.
