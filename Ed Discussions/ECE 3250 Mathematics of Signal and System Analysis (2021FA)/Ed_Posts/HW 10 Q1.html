  I thiink the only k's to look at are 0 and -1 and so for each of those particular delta iintegrals i have the limit as (-pi to -pi+a/2) and (pi-a/2 to pi). The terms under the integrals respectively are
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  \lim\left(a-&gt;0\right)\left[\int_{-\pi}^{-\pi+\frac{\alpha}{2}}2\pi p\left(w+\pi\right)e^{jnw}+\int_{\pi-\frac{\alpha}{2}}^{\pi}2\pi p\left(w-\pi\right)e^{jnw}\right]
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  does this seem correct?

  This seems almost correct, but remember that the $p$-terms under the integral signs are equal to 1 over the range of the integrals, and you need a $1 / a$ out in front of the brackets.

  am i supposed to be arriving at a sinc function when evaluating these integrals? I am getting something like
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  \lim\left(a-&gt;0\right)\text{sinc}\left(n\text{a/2}\right)
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  But i am nott sure where the power of -n is supposed to come from

  Yean, and L'HÃ´pital tells you the value.

  And somehow you're missing a $( - 1 ) ^ n$, which comes from $e ^ {\pm j n \pi} = ( - 1 ) ^ n$.
