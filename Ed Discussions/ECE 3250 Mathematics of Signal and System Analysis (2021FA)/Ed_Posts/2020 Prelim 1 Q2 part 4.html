 I said that cos(t) for [0,2*pi] would be uncountably infinite since it is a mapping from the reals to the reals, even though the input and output are bounded. Is this sufficient to say that it is uncountable infinite?

  Any interval of real numbers is uncountably infinite.  (Except trivial intervals consisting of one point.)
