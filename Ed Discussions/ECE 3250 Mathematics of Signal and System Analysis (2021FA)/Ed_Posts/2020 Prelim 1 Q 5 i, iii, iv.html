  i) Why doesn't the max of C exist if we know that the max of A exists and C only depends on the elements of A?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  iii) Doesn't be become unbounded if a -&gt; 0?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  iii) I thought this would require inf to be greater than sup? Like if the greatest lower bound was greater than the lowest upper bound, then the set couldn't exist?

  (i) What if $\max ( A )$ doesn't exist?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  (iii) $A$ is bounded, so it has a sup, call it $\overline{v}$, so $B$ is bounded from above by $e ^ {\overline{v}}$.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  (iii) I think you might have your definitions mixed up.  The inf is the low thing, the sup is the high thing.

  for the second (iii), i thought that for inf(A) to not be in the set, it would have to be greater than the high thing since it is normally the low thing when it is in the set?

  For $\inf ( A ) \notin A$, it has to be below all elements of $A$ --- like if $A = ( 0 , 1 )$, $\inf ( A ) = 0 \notin A$.
