 Just to confirm, for something, if I have a signal like x = 7^n. And I have a valid transfer function H(z). If 7 lies in the region of convergence of H(z), then y = h * x = H(7) * x. I get in the case if x was a constant signal and |z| = 1 was in the region of convergence, you can just plug H(1), but I don't know why that works in this case.
