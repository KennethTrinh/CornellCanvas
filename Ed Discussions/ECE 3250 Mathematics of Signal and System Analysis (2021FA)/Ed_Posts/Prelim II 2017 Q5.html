 Why isn't ii correct? Isn't this basically 9.12 in the monograph?

  The orthonormal set might not be complete, which 9.12 requires.

   Is iii also not true because the orthonormal set is not necessarily complete, and otherwise it would be?

    I said iii was false since W is a subset of V, so the orthonormal set may not span all of V. For example say V is C^4 and W is [1000] [0100] and [0010]. V also contains [0001] which would be orthogonal to all of the vectors in W and [0001] isn't the zero vector.
