  I had a couple of questons on the problems I had gotten wrong on both Preliim 1 and Prelim 2
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Prelim 1:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  3) Why is iii) correct here? Not really sure how to approach this part
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  5) i) what happens in a scenario when A [0, 1) where the max would be 0 but the sup is 1.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  7) iv) I am not too sure why this is false. From what I understand all convergent sequences are Cauchy sequences and isn't the statement given in this part the definition of a cauchy sequence, Or is this statement, missing the "when n&gt; epsilon part"
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Prelim 2:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  3) ii) Why is a linear combination possible here to preserve the period. I thought linear combinations of equally periodic sinusoidal signals doesn't always imply a result that also has the same period.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  4) iv) why is this part true. I thought the basis for this particular subspace only spans from k=-19 to 19. part iv) implies that e^(-j(23)(2pi)/17) is orthogonal to all the orthonormal basis functions that compose x, even though 23 is not within -19 and 19. So, why is this statement true for 4.

  Sorry it took me so long to get to this post.

  3(iii) They both have "multiplicative inverses" in $\mathbb{Z} _ a ^ *$ so their product mod $a$ can't be zero.  Like, multiply by the multiplicative inverse of $m$ and you get $\langle n \rangle _ a = 0$, which is impossible for any $n \in \mathbb{Z} _ a$.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  5(i) When $A$ is $[ 0 , 1 )$, $\min ( A ) = 0$ but $A$ has no max.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  A convergent sequence need not converge "monotonically" to its limit.  Like, one term could be an outlier.  E..g this sequence converges to 0: $5, 4, 3, 10^{59}, 2, 1 , 0, 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 \ldots$
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  3(ii) A linear combo will preserve having 19 as a period, but won't necessarily preserve having 19 as

  period.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  4(iv) just says that the $k = 23$ Fourier series coefficient of $x$ is zero, which it is because $x$ has nonzero Fourier coefficients only out as far as $k = \pm 19$.

  for 5i) on prelim1, when would max(A) &gt; sup(A)? I'm a bit confused because in the monograph it says that "If a set A does indeed have a maximum, then the maximum is equal to sup(A)."(page 41).

  i think it says &gt;= instead of just &gt;. &gt;= still implies the equal to
