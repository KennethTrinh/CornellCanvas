  For continuous time signals are we considering t values below 0. If so, what do these "negative" times practically mean?

  Yes, we consider $t &lt; 0$-values, just as for discrete-time signals we consider $n &lt; 0$-values.  My view is that there's no "beginning of time" (let's not get into a Big Bang discussion here), and assigning $t = 0$ to some particular "real-world time" is kind of arbitrary.  All the math is easier when signals' domains extend over all of $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{Z}$.  How would we define a periodic signal if time didn't extend over all $\mathbb{R}$?   Also, if we insisted that $t$ represent "actual physical time" and $t = 0$ represent some "actual physical time," we would have to consider different problems' initializations occurring at $t =$ something else depending on what time of day we did them (perhaps).

  I could go on and on "making excuses," I guess .... remember, we're just modeling the real world mathematically.
