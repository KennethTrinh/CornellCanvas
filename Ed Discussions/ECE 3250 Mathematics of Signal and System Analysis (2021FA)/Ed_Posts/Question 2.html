 I'm a bit confused on how to prove the identity. Is there an inner product equality or property that I may not be aware of that I can use. I began with the RHS by writing the norms in inner product notation. Is that the right first step?

  That's what I would do ---- convert the norms to inner products and use inner-product properties.  FYI I answered this earlier but for whatever reason Ed didn't post it.

   That's what I would do ---- write the norms on the RHS in inner-product form, then plug and chug.

    I'm a bit unsure what I am doing during the plug and chug part. Are there equalities that help with the simplification?

     The main things are the basic properties of inner products as on page 128 of the monograph.
