 If the integral in the second term of the system mapping were from 0 to infinity instead of negative infinity to t+1, would the system be causal?

  I think we'd need the integral to have an upperbound of $\leq t$, otherwise we'd need terms $x(t)$ for $t&gt;t_0$ to evaluate $S(x)(t_0)$. So integral bounds of 0 to t would work, as well as negative infinity to t
