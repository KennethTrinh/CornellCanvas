<p>
 For (i), will the LHS = RHS when v is a vector in the subspace whose orthonormal basis is {w1, w2, w3, w4, w5} ?
</p>
<p>
 For (iv), why is this wrong? When the V has dimension larger than 5, {wk} can't be the orthonormal basis and I think &lt;v, wk&gt; = 0 for nonzero v should be possible in this case?
</p>
<p>
 Thanks in advance!

  Yes to your first question.
 </p>
 <p>
  (iv) is false when $V$ has dimension exactly 5, which the question doesn't rule out.
