  Just wanted to confirm my understanding. Given a complete orthonormal set W in a finite V, we say that W is an orthonormal basis for V. An example would be [100] [010] and [001] for C^3. But if V is infinite, a complete orthonormal set is like an orthonormal basis, but isn't exactly a basis.

  Correct, but please add "-dimensional" after "finite" and "infinite" in what you wrote.
