 The only way to have a surjective mapping when the cardinalities are equal is for every element in A to map to an element in B. Which would imply an injective mapping too.
</p>
<p>
 Is this false because the sets are infinite?

  Every element in $A$ maps to an element in $B$ no matter what the properties of the mapping are.  For infinite sets of the same cardinality, a surjective mapping from one to the other need not be injective, e.g. the mapping $f : \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ defined by $f ( n ) = | n |$ for all $n \in \mathbb{Z}$.
