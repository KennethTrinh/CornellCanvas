 Can a summable sequence be unbounded? For example, a sequence containing +infinity and -infinity.

  First of all, for us infinity isn't a number, so in a sequence $\{ c _ n \}$ every term $c _ n$ is an actual number and hence not infinity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Second, a summable sequence must be bounded.  You might wonder whether a sequence could be summable and have arbitrarily large terms that cancel out enabling the sum, e.g.
 </p>
 <p>
  $\{ c _ n \}  : \; 1 , - 1 , 2 , - 2 , 3 , -3 , 4 , -4 , 5 , -5 , \ldots$
  <break>
  </break>
 </p>
 <p>
  might look as if it "sums to zero," but it doesn't satisfy the definition of summability because the sequence of partial sums in the series $\sum _ {n = 0} ^ \infty c _ n$is
 </p>
 <p>
  $1 , 0 , 2 , 0 , 3 , 0 , 4 , 0 , 5 , 0 , \ldots$,
 </p>
 <p>
  which doesn't converge.
