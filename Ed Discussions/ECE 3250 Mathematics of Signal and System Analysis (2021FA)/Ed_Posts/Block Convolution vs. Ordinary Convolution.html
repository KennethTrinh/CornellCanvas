 For HW10 Q7 Part c, I find that it is a lot easier to compute the convolution the normal way/the first way we learned it instead of block convolution. Since one of the input signals has to be finite duration, it simplifies the sum a lot. Can you give an example where block convolution makes the calculations a lot simpler?

  The homework problem is a toy example intended to have you go through the drill of block convolution.  If the signals are more complicated and difficult to work with than those in the problem, block convolution can save you not not only MAC operations but more general kinds of analytical pain.  I hereby dodge the task of coming up with a specific example that ypu'll agree is "a lot simpler" to do by block convo than by straight-up convo.

   From what i understand, the block convolution works similar to the STDFT that we learned in 2200. I am not sure if this is correct. As for an application, i thnk in the monograph he gave an instance of like a periodic signal of Length L
