 I am having a hard time figuring out what this answer choice below means. I thought that it would be time invariant because the inner product would not be affected by a time shift, but I can't see how it is closed under linear combinations. How would the inner product still be guaranteed to be 0 after a linear combination?

 (iv) The set of all decent square-integrable continuous-time signals x that satisfy 〈x,w〉=

 0, where w(t) = e^−tu(t) for all t ∈R and the inner product is the usual L2 inner product

  Say $\langle x _ 1 , w \rangle = \langle x _ 2, w \rangle = 0$.  Then for all constants $c _ 1$ and $c _ 2$ we have
 </p>
 <p>
  $\langle c _ 1 x _ 1 + c _ 2 x _ 2 , w \rangle = c _ 1 \langle x _ 1 , w \rangle + c _ 2 \langle x _ 2, w \rangle = 0$.
