 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 I am not sure why 2020 Q4 part (iv) is false.  I thought shift(x) has the same period as x.  Scaling by 11 shouldn't change the period either, but is it that the LC of the two shifted x (both with fundamental period 13) possibly create a signal with fundamental period larger than 13?
</p>
<p>
 Thanks!

  Both of those shifts of $x$ are equal to $x$, so the signal in question is the zero signal.
