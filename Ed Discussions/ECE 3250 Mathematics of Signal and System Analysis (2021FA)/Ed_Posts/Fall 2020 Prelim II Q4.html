  Hi,
 </paragraph>

 <paragraph>
  I am not sure why 2020 Q4 part (iv) is false.  I thought shift(x) has the same period as x.  Scaling by 11 shouldn't change the period either, but is it that the LC of the two shifted x (both with fundamental period 13) possibly create a signal with fundamental period larger than 13?

  Thanks!

  Both of those shifts of $x$ are equal to $x$, so the signal in question is the zero signal.
