 Trying to wrap my head around what u(T-t) looks like and how it affects the limits of integration. U(T) is easy, it affects the limits by turning [-infinity, infinity] into z [0,infinity]. Similarly U(-T) would create an upper bound by changing [-infinity, infinity] to [-infinity, 0]. I know from class that u(t-T) changes the limits to [0,t] for t&gt;0 and t&lt;0 is 0, but I don't entirely understand why. From this fact, I would guess that u(T-t) would change the limits to [-t,0] for t&lt;0 and 0 for t&gt;0, but I'm not sure how to arrive there by myself.

  If I understand your question, it's because u(t-tau) is 1 while tau &lt;= t, and zero  for tau &gt; t. u is a function of tau because that's the integration variable. Any unit step for a negative function variable equals 1 up until its "argument" is zero, beyond which it is 0. Like u(2-t) is 1 for t &lt;= 2, and 0 for t&gt;2.

   I have a hard time following your question.  Might be easier in person.
