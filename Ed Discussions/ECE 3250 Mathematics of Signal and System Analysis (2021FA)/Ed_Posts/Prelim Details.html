 Are the prelims closed book or open notes? And what topics will be covered for each prelim?

  Prelims will be closed-book.  Before each prelim I'll tell you what it covers (I'm never quite sure until about a week in advance).   I'll circulate prelims from previous semesters so you can see what's coming.
