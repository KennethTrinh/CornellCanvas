  I recall hearing in class that 5ii was true, but what's the intuition behind the square integrability of the projection coefficients? Also, does ii hold when W is not a complete orthonormal subset of V?

  The infinite sum in (ii) comes out to be $\| v \| ^ 2$.  If $\mathcal{W}$ isn't complete, you still have that infinite sum bounded above by $\| v \| ^ 2$, so yeah, (ii) is true in that case, as well.
