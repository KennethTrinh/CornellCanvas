 What was the last topic of today's (Tuesday's) lecture? I'm missed lecture and I'm trying to know if I caught up to everything up to the end of the lecture.

  We talked more about continuous-time signals.  The main point: we have continuous-time versions of all the discrete-time signal stuff but need to be careful to restrict our attention to continuous-time signals that aren't "pathological" in various ways.

  We defined continuous-time convolution, pointing out the parallels with discrete time, then went through criteria similar to those in discrete time that guarantee existence of $x _ 1 * x _ 2$.  We did a couple of example convolution calculations.
 </p>

  The lecture wrapped up with the formal definition of a continuous-time LTI system plus continuous-time versions of the simple example systems we studied in discrete time.  We were in the middle of that when time ran out.
