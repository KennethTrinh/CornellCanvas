  I would like to check the reasoning for these questions:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  (i) I said
  <bold>
   true
  </bold>
  because the system "looks" linear. I think that a linear combination of the inputs would result in a similar linear combination of the outputs.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  (ii) I said
  <bold>
   true
  </bold>
  . I plugged in $\delta(t)$ and $\delta(t-1)$ for the inputs and compared that to shifting the output $S(\delta)$ right by 1. But this does not feel like good reasoning.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  (iii) I said
  <bold>
   false
  </bold>
  because the system uses values of $x(t+1)$ in the integrals to calculate the output $S(x)(t)$.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  (iv) I am not sure how to approach this. Do I just plug in $\delta$ for the input to get $h(t)$ and then try to calculate the Fourier transform of $h(t)$?

 <paragraph>
  For (iii) and (iv), correct.  (i) and (ii) are true because the RHS is of the general form of a LTI I/O mapping, i.e. $S ( x ) = h _ 0 * x +$ a shift-type term.
