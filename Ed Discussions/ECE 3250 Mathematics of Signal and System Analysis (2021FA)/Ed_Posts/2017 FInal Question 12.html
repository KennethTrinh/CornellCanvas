 Why is i) false? I thought that since there was no term to the -3k that Xhat should be 0 when k = 3. How does one read off the signal from the Xhatk given?

  (ii) covers the absence of the $- 3 k$ term.

  (i) $\widehat{X} ( 3 \times 2 \pi / 5 )$ is what you get when you plug $k = 3$ into the formula in the problem statement, and that's not zero.
