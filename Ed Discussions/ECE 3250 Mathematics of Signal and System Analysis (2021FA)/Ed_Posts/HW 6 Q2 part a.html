  This question asks us to put the signal in the form c_0*u(t) + (c_1*exp(-3t) + c_2*exp(-7t)). However, when I do the integration I get exp(-2t) and exp(-6t) instead. Was this just a typo in the homework, or did I do the integration incorrectly? Thank you.

  Ah I see the mistake, you can't apply the power rule to exp(-3t). Sometimes my brain forgets about calculus
