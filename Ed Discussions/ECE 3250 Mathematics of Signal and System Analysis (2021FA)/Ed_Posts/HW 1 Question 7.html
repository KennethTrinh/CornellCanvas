  I am struggling a bit to see the logical jump from the first equation in the picture to the second. I was able to get to that first equation but I am not completely sure where the induction assumption is arising from.

  Induction assumption tells you that $\langle ( m - 1 ) ^ p \rangle _ p = m - 1$.

  but doesn't this deal with m-1 and not m, so it oesn not necessarily prove the necessary induction, unless I am just not able to link these two

  In other words, it seems like I am able to prove that (m-1)^p-1 = 1 mod p, but that's not the induction

  I don't understand these last two questions.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The base case for the induction, i.e. $k = 1$, is obvious.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Now suppose you've proved it for all $k \leq m - 1$ --- in particular, suppose you've proved it for $k = m - 1$, i.e. you've proved that $\langle ( m - 1 ) ^ p \rangle _ p = m - 1$.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Then carry on to prove it for $k = m$.  I guess I'm just totally missing what you're not getting about that ....
