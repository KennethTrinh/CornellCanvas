 I thought that the definition of surjective mappings only implied that for every b in B there was at least one a in A where f(a)=b. (In other words "Every b has at least one a")
</p>
<p>
 If that is the case then I am not sure that (iv) of Q1 in Fall 2020 Final Exam should be correct.
</p>
<p>
 Is my definition of a surjective mapping incorrect?
</p>

  Your definition of surjective mapping is correct, and (iv) here is just the definition of a mapping, period.

   I think the definition of an A to B mapping says every element in A should be mapped to some element in B?
