 I missed discussion today because of an interview.  What pages in the monograph did we cover, so that I could go back and catch up on what I missed?
</p>
<p>
 (Not sure if there are recordings on Canvas)
</p>
<p>
 Thanks!
</p>

  The YouTube recordings are okay, but every year I do things a little differently, so deciphering the order might be hard.  In terms of the monograph, pages 69-70 cover the material from today, but in the lecture I focused on intuition for the results in a way the monograph doesn't.  If you can get somebody's notes, that might help.

   There are Youtube recordings, search ECE 3250 and they should show up. But also we talked about signals and how different types of signals are closed within their subspaces by linear combination.
  </p>
  <p>
   Example, a bounded signal + a bounded signal = a bounded signal. Its the same for signals like right/left handed signals and finite duration signals. The last thing we talked about was the "infinity norm" of a signal x being:
  </p>
  <p>
   ||x|| = sup({|x(n)| : n in Z})
  </p>

    I don't know if the youtube recordings are reliable because they're from 5 years ago
