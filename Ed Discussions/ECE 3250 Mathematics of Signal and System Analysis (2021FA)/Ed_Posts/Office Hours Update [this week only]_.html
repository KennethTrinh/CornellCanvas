 Hi All,
</p>
<p>
 Hope everyone is enjoying Fall break. On that note, there are no office hours this Tuesday (Oct 12) and Wednesday (Oct 13).
</p>
<p>
 If someone does want to meet this week, I am happy to arrange a time for Thursday, Friday, or the weekend :)
</p>

 Feel free to share your thoughts below or send me an email (stk53).
