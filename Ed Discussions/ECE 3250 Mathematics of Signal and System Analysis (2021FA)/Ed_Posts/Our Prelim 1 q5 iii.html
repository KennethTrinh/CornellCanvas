 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 For our first prelim, why is q5 iii answer false?  I thought that you could plug in the upper and lower bounds of A and they would be upper and lower bounds of B.
</p>
<p>
 Thank you!
</p>

  Nikhil, OP asked not about Prelim II but about Prelim I 5(iii) --- for that problem, how about $A = ( 0 , 1 )$?

   Hm, I am not quite sure because I know that there are a continuum of real numbers between 0 and 1 so I see how it would be hard to pick out the value that makes it the largest for example, but wouldn't it still be bounded by something?

   I am having trouble seeing how this differs from fall 2020 prelim1, 5iii

    It's bounded from above but not from below --- it goes all the way to $- \infty$.  Specifically, $B = ( - \infty , 0 )$.

     why is the 5iii from 2017 still true even though e^a I do not think is bounded from above?

      $A$ is bounded from above, say by $\overline{v}$, so $B$ is bounded from above by $e ^ {\overline{v}}$.
