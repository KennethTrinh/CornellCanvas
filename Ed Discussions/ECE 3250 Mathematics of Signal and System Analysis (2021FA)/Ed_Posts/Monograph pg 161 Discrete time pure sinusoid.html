  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I didn't understand page 161 of the monograph that is motivating why the discrete time pure sinusoid having frequency content at $\omega_0$ is not trivial.

  I don't see how the sequence of numbers $e^{jn\omega_0}$ is not periodic and in continuous time it is.  I am envisioning it like a cosine with equally spaced n values on the x axis.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Also, I don't quite understand the last part of the paragraph.  Is it saying that it is "bad" that the frequency content looks the same at $2\pi$ multiples away from $\omega_0$?  Is this not true in general?  Doesn't that same thing hold in continuous time without issue?

  As for non-periodicity of the sequence you ask about, it turns out to be periodic only for rare values of $\omega _ o$.  Like if you want $e ^ {j n \omega _ o} = e ^ {j ( n  + K ) \omega _ o}$ for some integer $K$, you need $e ^ {j K \omega _ o} = 1$, so $K \omega _ o$ has to be a multiple of $2 \pi$, which happens only for a countable set of $\omega _ o$-values.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Regarding the last paragraph, it's not true in continuous time that if $x$ has frequency content at $\Omega _ o$ it also has frequency content at $\Omega _ o + 2 \pi m$ for nonzero integers $m$.  Like, $x ( t ) = e ^ {j \Omega _ o t}$ has frequency content only at $\Omega _ o$ and at no other frequency.  Also, nothing "good" or "bad" about any of this stuff.  :-)

  Applying the same argument to continuous time, I know that
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  e^{j\Omega_0t}=e^{j\Omega_0\left(t-T_0\right)}
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  Because we have the $\Omega_0T_0 = 2\pi$ relation. I am failing to see how this is different in the discrete case?  If we choose any $\Omega_0$ and have period $T_0$ where this holds in continuous time, why can't we chose for any $\omega$ a $K$ that makes this hold in discrete time?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For the second part, why does it also not work out in continuous time?  Does it not hold true that
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  e^{j\left(\Omega_0+2\pi m\right)t}=e^{j\Omega_0t}
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  Because of the time variable t attached to the 2pim?

  $x ( t ) = e ^ {j \Omega _ o t}$ is indeed a periodic function of $t$.  For any $\Omega _ o$-value you can find infinitely many $T$-values for which $x ( t - T ) = x ( t )$ for all $t$.  Any such $T$ is an integer multiple of $2 \pi / \Omega _ o$.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  In discrete time, $K$ has to be an integer, and $\omega _ o K$ needs to be a multiple of $2 \pi$ --- only for certain $\omega _ o$-values can you find such a $K$. It's the integer constraint on $K$ that distinguishes the discrete-time case.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Your last equation is incorrect because it requires that $e ^ {j 2 \pi m t} = 1$ for all $t$, which holds only when $m = 0$.
