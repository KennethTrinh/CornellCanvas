  Strict in your sense is the same as proper.  In words:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  $A$ is a subset of $B$ when every $a \in A$ is also an element of $B$.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  $A$ is a proper subset of $B$ when $A$ is a subset of $B$ but $A \neq B$, i.e. there exists at least one $b \in B$ that's not an element of $A$.
