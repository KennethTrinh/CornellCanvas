 What is the difference between a strict subset (A âŠŠ B) versus a proper subset and a general subset?

  Strict in your sense is the same as proper.  In words:
 </p>
 <p>
  $A$ is a subset of $B$ when every $a \in A$ is also an element of $B$.
 </p>
 <p>
  $A$ is a proper subset of $B$ when $A$ is a subset of $B$ but $A \neq B$, i.e. there exists at least one $b \in B$ that's not an element of $A$.
