 How can this question be done in a way that's easier than comparing the cardinalities of the two sets? I am thinking of using induction on n greater than or equal to 2 elements but i'm not sure if that is what is intended

  No induction!  Here's a suggestion.  let $f$ be a choice function for $A = \{ a , b \}$.  What is $f ( \{ a \} )$?  What is $f ( \{ b \})$?   What is $f ( \{ a , b \} )$?
