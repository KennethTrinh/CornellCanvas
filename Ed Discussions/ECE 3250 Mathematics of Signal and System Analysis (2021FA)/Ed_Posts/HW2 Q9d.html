 <paragraph>
  The monograph states that if a set of real numbers C is bounded from below, then there exists a sequence {cn} of numbers in C such that the limit as n -&gt; infinity is inf(C).
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  This question states that every cn is a positive number, so wouldn't that mean that inf(C) is 1? I am confused because the question is asking whether each statement is sometimes true or always true, but wouldn't this statement never be true?

  "Is never true" is an option for the problem --- you choose between "is always true" or "is not always true," and the second option includes ":is never true."
