 <paragraph>
  Given any two sets $A$ and $B$ (finite or infinite), does there always exist mappings $f: A \to B$  and $g: B \to A$ such that neither $f$ nor $g$ is surjective or injective?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Also, is mapping synonymous with function in that a mapping must map every element of one set to some element in the other set?
