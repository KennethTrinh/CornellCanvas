 Given any two sets $A$ and $B$ (finite or infinite), does there always exist mappings $f: A \to B$  and $g: B \to A$ such that neither $f$ nor $g$ is surjective or injective?
</p>
<p>
 Also, is mapping synonymous with function in that a mapping must map every element of one set to some element in the other set?

  To first question: assuming all sets are nonempty and have at least two elements, the answer is Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  To second question, Yes.
