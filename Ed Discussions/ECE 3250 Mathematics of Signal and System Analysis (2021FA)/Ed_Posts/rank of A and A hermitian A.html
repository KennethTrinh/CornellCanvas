  Why does rank$(A) =$ rank$(A^HA)$? I'm trying to think about it in terms of the independent vectors in rowspace of $A$ multiplying together to get linearly independent vectors in $ A^HA$, and the vectors in the nullspace being dependent with the vectors in the row space, but I'm not sure if this is the right way to go about it.

  $A ^ H A$ and $A$ both have $n$ columns and their nullspaces are exactly the same.  Since rank is $n$ - dimension of the nullspace, their ranks are the same.

  Proof in monograph.  I'll put it here when back at a computer.  Did you look in the monograph before posing these questions?

  Now back at a computer:

  $A v = 0$ clearly implies $A ^ H A v = 0$.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  $A ^ H A v = 0$ implies $v ^ H A ^ H A v = 0$ implies $\left \| A v \right \| ^ 2 = 0$ implies $A v = 0$.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Conclusion: $A v = 0$ if and only if $A ^ H A v = 0$.
