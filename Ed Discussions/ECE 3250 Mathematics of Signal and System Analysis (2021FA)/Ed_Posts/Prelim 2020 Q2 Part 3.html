  When I asked this initially, the system that was given as an example was the integrator. But i just realized that the integrator, at least I don't think has a finite duration h signal. So, then why is iii false?

  Canonical example is:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  = $h$ comes from an averager, say over interval of length $T$
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  = $x$ is a zero-mean periodic signal with $T$ as a period.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Then $h * x$ is the zero signal, which doesn't have infinite duration.

  oh ok I think where I was confused was that I thought 0 was infite duration cuz it was 0 everywhere but I guess its also trivially finite duration
