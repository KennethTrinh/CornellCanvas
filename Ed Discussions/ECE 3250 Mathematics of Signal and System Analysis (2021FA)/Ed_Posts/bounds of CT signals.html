 Is $\lim_{n\to \infty} |x(n)| = 0$ true for every integrable signal? Or are we allowed to define some signal that has nonzero values for a finite duration at $n\to \infty$?
</p>
<p>
 Conversely, is $\lim_{n\to \infty} |x(n)| &gt; 0$ true for every non-integrable signal? (not in L1, L2...L$^{\infty}$)
</p>

  You've mixed discrete- and continuous-time notation here.
 </p>
 <p>
  In discrete time, you need $x ( n ) \rightarrpw 0$ as $n \rightarrow \pm \infty$ for $x$ to be absolutely summable.
 </p>
 <p>
  In continuous time, you don't need $x ( t ) \rightarrow 0$ as $ t \rightarrow \pm \infty$ for $x$ to be absolutely integrable.  The counterexamples are kind of weird, but even decent counterexamples exist.
 </p>
 <p>
  And you can have $x ( n ) \rightarrow 0$ as $n \rightarrow \pm \infty$ even for non-summable signals, e.g. $x ( n ) = ( 1 / n ) u ( n -  1 )$.  Similarly in continuous time.
