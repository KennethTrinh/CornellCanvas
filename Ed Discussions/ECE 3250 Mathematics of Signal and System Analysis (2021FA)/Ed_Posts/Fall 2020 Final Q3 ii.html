  I am curious as to why option ii of q3 on the fall 2020 final exam is correct.  I thought Fermat's Little Theorem stated that that expression should be equal to 1 not p.

 <paragraph>
  For example: if p=3 and q=5 then that expression evaluates to 1

  Where have I gone wrong?

  You're right.  Sometimes I forget to correct the answer sheet when I find a mistake later, like if everybody's getting something wrong, I'll re-do the problem to make sure I had it right.  In this case, (ii) is false.
