  In other post, you mentioned this statement implies nothing about h being absolutely summable.  I'm confused on this because one of the definitions provided in the monograph is that if
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  the\ sequence\ a_n\ goes\ to\ 0\ as\ n\longrightarrow\infty,\ then\ the\ series\ that\ sums\ a\ is\ summable
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  Given this fact, why wouldn't it be true that if a sequence goes to 0 as n approaches positive and negative infinity, that it is absolutely summable?

  I feel like the harmonic series is a counterexample?

  Maybe I am mistaken.  I thought I read it at some point earlier in the semester to do HW3.  I couldn't find that statement in my monograph or notes.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I am not sure why I have assumed that to be true all this time.

  If it turns up in the monograph, please let me know --- I would need to fix not only the substance but the style!  :-)
