 The way I understand iv is take an admissible signal $x=e^{j\Omega _0 t}$, find its bandlimited Fourier transform $\hat{X}$, find $\hat{S} = \hat{H} \hat{X}$, and now $\hat{S}$ has finite duration in $\Omega$-space because $\hat{X}$ is bandlimited. This implies that $S(x)$ is bandlimited.
</p>
<p>
 Is this the right way to think about it? By thinking about it like this I think I'm conflating the two signal-into-system diagrams. Is there a more efficient way to arrive to this conclusion?

  $x$ could also be a bandlimited signal with a "nice" Fourier transform, and your argument for the Fourier transform of $S ( x )$ being zero outside of a bounded $\Omega$-interval still holds.  That's what I actually had in mind when I wrote the problem.  If you want to use finitely summed pure sinusoidal $x$'s, it's probably better to process them one by one using what I call the "first picture" and then you'll see that the output is still a sum of pure sinusoids and is bandlimited.
