  In the lectures posted on youtube, you gave an instance where the x-transform exists but the DTFT doesn't. The example was (3^n)u(n). I see how the z-tranform exists but i don't see how the DTFT doesn't. I get that 3^n grows exponential but can't you still treat the DTFT equation n that case like a geometric series like it was done in the z-transform instance.

  For a geometric series $\sum _ {n = 0} ^ \infty \gamma ^ n$ to converge, you need $| \gamma | &lt; 1$.  If you set up the DTFT equation for that signal, you get a geometric series with $\gamma = 3 e ^ {- j \omega}$, which has magnitude 3.
