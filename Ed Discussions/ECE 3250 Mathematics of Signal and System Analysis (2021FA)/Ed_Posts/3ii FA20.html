  Just wanted to confirm some reasoning:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  L: Not a subspace because the 0 signal doesn't have a fundamental period of 19 (and the 0 combination is the only one that doesn't have a fundamental period of 19)?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  S: Not closed under shifting because of the "must be 0 at t=0 property" (and without this property it would be closed under shifting)?
 </paragraph>

  L: Mostly correct, but the zero signal isn't the only one that doesn't have a fundamental period of 19.  Monograph has an example someplace.

  S: Correct.
