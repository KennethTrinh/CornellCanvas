 Just wanted to confirm some reasoning:
</p>
<p>
 L: Not a subspace because the 0 signal doesn't have a fundamental period of 19 (and the 0 combination is the only one that doesn't have a fundamental period of 19)?
</p>
<p>
 S: Not closed under shifting because of the "must be 0 at t=0 property" (and without this property it would be closed under shifting)?
</p>

  L: Mostly correct, but the zero signal isn't the only one that doesn't have a fundamental period of 19.  Monograph has an example someplace.
 </p>
 <p>
  S: Correct.
