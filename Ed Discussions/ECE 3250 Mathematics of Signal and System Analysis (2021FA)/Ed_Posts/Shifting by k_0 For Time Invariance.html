<p>
 For a non time-invariant system, besides for k_0 is equal to 0, could there still exist a k_0 such that S(Shift_k_0 (x)) == Shift_k_0(S(x))? Or would do we just define a system as time-invariant if one k_0 causes that equality to not hold?

  Never mind, I think one of the other homework questions implies this to be true
