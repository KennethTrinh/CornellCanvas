 Why is z = 1 one here. And say the input was a sinusoidal enput like e^j3n, how would we get the z transform in that case

  I think we can just use this fact above. H(z) has 1 within its ROC, so that H-hat-(w) where w = 0 equals to H(z) with z = e^(j*0) = 1. We also know that y(n) = H-hat-(w) * x(n), so that y(n) = H(1) * x(n) = 50/7 * 7 = 50

  Any constant input $x ( n ) = c _ o$ is of the form $x ( n ) = c _ o z _ o ^ n$ for $z _ o = 1$,  An input of the form $c _ o z _ o ^ n$ works for the system precisely when $z _ o$ is in the ROC for $H ( z )$, and the output signal is then $c _ o H ( z _ o ) z _ o ^ n$.  Plug in 1 for $z _ o$ and you get the answer to this problem.

   Just to clarify, the existence of a DTFT from the z-Transform equation or basically you can only sub in e^jw into z when |z| &lt; 1 falls within the region of convergence.
