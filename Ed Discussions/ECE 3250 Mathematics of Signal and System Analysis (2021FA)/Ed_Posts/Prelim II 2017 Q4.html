  Correct answers i,iii,iv? For iv, what does it mean when we say a signal is real-valued?

  Just (iii) and (iv) are true.  The Fourier series would need to have finitely many nonzero terms for (i) to be true.  Real-valued means $x ( t )$ is a real number for all $t$.  Fot this signal, it's true because the $\pm k$ terms pair up via Euler to give cosines and their imaginary parts cancel out.  Specifically,

 <paragraph>
  $x ( t ) =  1 / 7 + \sum _ {k = 1} ^ \infty \frac{2}{k ^ 2 + 7} \cos ( k ( 2 \pi / 17 ) t )$ for all $t$.

  I'm struggling to see how x(t) is finite duration (a requirement if x(t) is not band limited). Any help?

  $x$ doesn't have finite duration.  Not bandlimited doesn't imply finite-duration, but the converse holds.
