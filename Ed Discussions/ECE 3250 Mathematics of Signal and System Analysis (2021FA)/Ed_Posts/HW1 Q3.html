  Unfortunately, no, as far as I can tell.  Thing is, if ${\rm card} ( A ) \leq \rm{card} ( B )$, you still have mappings $f : A \rightarrow B$ that arent injective.

  Can we assume that f is well-defined? I can't think of an example where card(A)&lt;=card(B) that isn't injective and is still well-defined.

  All the mappings here are well defined.
