  In this equation, it makes sense why the l1 signal always converges for each value of K since its absolutely summable, but if x2 isn’t absolutely summable wouldn’t there be a chance the sum blows up and thus not be defined for each K value. Why is the sum value (for each K) guaranteed to exist if only one signal is absolutely summable.

  Never mind so it makes sense since if x2 is bounded it’ll never blow up an abs sum x1 creates
