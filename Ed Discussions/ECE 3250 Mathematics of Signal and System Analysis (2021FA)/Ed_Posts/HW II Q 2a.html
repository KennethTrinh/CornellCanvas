  For homework II question 2 part a, does the question want us to find the value of the expression using the Euler and Fermat approach that it mentions? Or using the method of repeated squares like in part b? I couldn't tell from the wording of the question. Thank you!

  Try doing it using Euler/Fermat --- by mentioning them, the problem gives you a hint.
