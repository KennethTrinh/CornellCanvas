 For question 6, why is iv not true as well. The problem doesn't state that set is a complete orthonormal set, so doesn't that guarantee that at least one non-zero vector exists where the dot product is 0?
</p>
<p>
 For question 5, Why is ii no? since its an hilbert space wont the convergence of the N-&gt;infinity hold.
</p>

  For 6(iv), if $V$ has dimension exactly 5, then the set of $w$'s is a basis for $V$, and nothing in $V$ is orthogonal to all of them.
 </p>
 <p>
  For 5(ii), $\mathcal{W}$ isn't necessarily a
  <i>
   complete
  </i>
  orthonormal set in $V$, which it needs to be for (ii) to hold for all $v \in V$.

   I understand the explanation for 5 (ii), but I don't think I fully understand the explanation for 6. I get the w's  constitute a basis but then after that I don't understand the explanation.

    An orthonormal basis for a finite-dimensional inner product space is the simplest example of a complete orthonormal set.  If $V$ in this problem has dimension 5, then for every $v \in V$ we have
   </p>
   <p>
    $v = \sum _ {k = 1} ^ 5 \langle v , w _ k \rangle w _ k$.
   </p>
   <p>
    It follows that $v = 0$ if $\langle v , w _ k \rangle = 0$ for all $k$.
   </p>

     So if you are an orthonormal basis set for a finite dimension vector space, then are you automatically a complete set?
    </p>
    <p>
     And so to clarify, a complete orthnormal set then becomes the orthonormal basis for an infinite dimensional vector space?

      To the first question, Yes.
     </p>
     <p>
      To the second, "orthonormal basis" is kind of a loose term to apply to an infinite-dimensional vector space, but essentially it's like this: a complete orthonormal set in a Hilbert space (not just any inner product space) is like an orthonormal basis for the space in the sense that you can write every $v$ in the space as an "infinite linear combo" of the basis vectors.
