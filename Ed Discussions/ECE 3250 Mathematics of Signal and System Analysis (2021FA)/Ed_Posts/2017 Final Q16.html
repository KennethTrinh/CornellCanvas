  Why are the second and fifth bullet points false? I am having trouble understanding what these points are saying.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Also why is the ninth point true while the eighth is false?

  2. I think x_c is the original continuous-time signal, which may or may not be recovered using the sinc function T-interpolator based on how fast the sampling rate is.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  5. Similar for 5, T_1 need to be fast enough for the equation to hold
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I think 8. and 9. are actualy the same, and for the equation to hold we need to make sure
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  \frac{2\pi}{T_2}\ &gt;\ 2\Omega_m\ \Leftrightarrow\ \frac{2\pi}{T_1}=\frac{2\pi}{\frac{1}{3}T_2}&gt;6\ \Omega_m
 </math>

  (ii) RHS is $x _ R$, which only equals $x _ c$ if sampling is fast enough.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  (v) Same as (ii)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  (viii and (ix) $y$ is the same as $x _ c$ sampled every $3 T _ 1$.  For no aliasing, we need $2 \pi / 3 T _ 1 &gt; 2 \Omega _ m$, or $2\pi / T _ 2 &gt; 2 \Omega _ m$,   (ix) makes that happen but (viii) doesn't.
