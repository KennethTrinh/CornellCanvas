 I'm not too surre how to approach this problem. None of the criteria seem to apply since the 3u is bounded but the 1/abs(n)!  is not absolutely summable so criterion 3 does not apply. None of the other criteria seem to apply as well. All help is appreciated.

  Re-check summability of $1 / | n | !$.

   is there a way to intuitively by listing out the series know that this converges without having to do the ratio test or other convergence tests.

    Think about the series for $e ^ t$.
