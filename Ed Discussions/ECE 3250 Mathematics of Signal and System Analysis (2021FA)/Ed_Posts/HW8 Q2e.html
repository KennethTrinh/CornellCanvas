  For question 2e, it asks to find the  Fourier transform Y of the response y of the low-pass filter to the signal x. What low-pass filter is this referring to? The one at the start of question 2 or the one in 2d?

  The one at the beginning of the problem --- the thing in (d) is a signal whose Fourier transform looks like the frequency response of an ideal low-pass filter, i.e. I didn't think of the thing in (d) as a "filter."
