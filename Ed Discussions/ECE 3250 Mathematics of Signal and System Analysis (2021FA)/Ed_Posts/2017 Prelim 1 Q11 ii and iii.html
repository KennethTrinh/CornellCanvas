  I think that ii implies that h is finite duration and ii implies h is left sided if not finite duration. How does this tie into BIBO stability?

  (ii) says IF BIBO stable, THEN impulse response decays to zero as $n \rightarrow \pm \infty$ --- which it must because it's an absolutely summable signal.  Nothing here about FIR.

  (iii) says system is FIR.  Does that mean the impulse response is absolutely summable?  I think so.

  Could you elaborate as to why a finite impulse response means that is is absolutely summable (and therefore l-1)? I understand how h has to be l-1 to prove the system is BIBO, but how does this qualify h to be abs summable? Say h = 3 for [0,5] and 0 else. Sum -infinity to infinity gets you 3(6) = 18. You can calculate the sum, but it isn't zero. My understanding was that it has to be zero.

  The sum just has to be finite, not zero.
