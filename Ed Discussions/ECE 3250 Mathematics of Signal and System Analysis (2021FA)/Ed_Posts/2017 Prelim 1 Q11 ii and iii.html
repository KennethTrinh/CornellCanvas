 I think that ii implies that h is finite duration and ii implies h is left sided if not finite duration. How does this tie into BIBO stability?

  The sum just has to be finite, not zero.

   (ii) says IF BIBO stable, THEN impulse response decays to zero as $n \rightarrow \pm \infty$ --- which it must because it's an absolutely summable signal.  Nothing here about FIR.
  </p>
  <p>
   (iii) says system is FIR.  Does that mean the impulse response is absolutely summable?  I think so.

    Could you elaborate as to why a finite impulse response means that is is absolutely summable (and therefore l-1)? I understand how h has to be l-1 to prove the system is BIBO, but how does this qualify h to be abs summable? Say h = 3 for [0,5] and 0 else. Sum -infinity to infinity gets you 3(6) = 18. You can calculate the sum, but it isn't zero. My understanding was that it has to be zero.
