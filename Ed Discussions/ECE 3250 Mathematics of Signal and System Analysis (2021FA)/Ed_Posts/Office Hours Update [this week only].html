  Hi All,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  There are no office hours this Tuesday (Nov 23) and Wednesday (Nov 24) since I will be traveling for Thanksgiving break.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If someone does want to meet this week, I am happy to arrange a time for Sunday evening or Monday morning and make a follow-up announcement :)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Feel free to share your thoughts below or send me an email (stk53).
