 I get why this is due to basic inner product rules, but I am bit confused on the time invariance part. Not sure why it isn't.

  Easy to think up a counterexample: e.g. a pulse of width 1 centered at $t = - 17$ is orthogonal to the given $w$, but once you shift the pulse to include positive values of $t$, it's no longer orthogonal to $w$.

   is this the w is a u(t) function and so now if the pulse was in the positive range, there would be overlap
