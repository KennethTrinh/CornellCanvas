 The only correct answers seem to be i and ii. For iii, this could be true if x=u for example, but there's nothing in the monograph that states it must be true so I said false. For iv, the -3 shift doesn't satisfy standing assumption 8.3 in the monograph, because that assumption is only for positive integers. Correct?

  Regarding (iv), the $- 3$ shift makes the system not causal --- the relevant monograph result is Theorem 8.5(2).  You need all the $t _ k$ in the shift part of $h$ to be positive.
