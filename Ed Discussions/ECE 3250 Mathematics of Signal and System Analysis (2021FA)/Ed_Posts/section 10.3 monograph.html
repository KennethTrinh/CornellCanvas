 it's stated in the monograph that for any decent finite duration signal $x(t)$, $\hat{X}$ exists. is this because $xe^{-j \Omega t}$ is decent and finite, and the area enclosed under a decent signal under a finite interval is finite?

  Yeah, so for every $\Omega$ you can integrate it from $- \infty$ to $\infty$ and get something finite.  BTW I think you mean "bounded interval" rather than "finite interval."
