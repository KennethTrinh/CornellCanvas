 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 in class we said that the rank of an Hermitian matrix Q is the number of nonzero eigenvalues of Q "counted with multiplicity"
</p>
<p>
 what does that mean?  is the rank the number of distinct nonzero eigenvalues, and repeated ones do not count towards rank?
</p>
<p>
 Thank you!
</p>

  Actually just the opposite.  Like for example the $( n \times n )$ identity matrix has only one distinct eigenvalue, namely 1, bot that eigenvalue has multiplicity $n$, and the identity matrix has rank $n$.  It has "$n$ nonzero eigenvalues, counted with multiplicity."

   Is calculating actual eigenvalues fair game on the exam?  Just wondering if I should memorize the process
  </p>
  <p>
   The last question of the bonus hw asks you to find the rank, what way to do you find is best to do so?  finding the eigenvalues and then counting them?

    Finding eigenvalues isn't fair game for an exam.
   </p>

    For finding rank, I would row-reduce a matrix and the rank will the number of nonzero rows at the end.
