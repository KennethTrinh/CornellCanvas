  As some of the students that came to office hours last night may remember, I have been feeling sick and as a result I had an appointment with Cornell Health today. To ensure everyone remains in good health, they have asked me to self-quarantine for today until they can be certain it is not Covid-19. As a result, I will not be able to host my rescheduled OH tonight. If you have any questions about the homework or practice finals, feel free to email me at idm23@cornell.edu. Thank you for understanding.
