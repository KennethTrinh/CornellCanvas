 Can you explain your reasoning for this question? I am having a hard time reading the answers in the margins so I am not sure where I went wrong.
</p>
<p>
 Far a), I found the z-transform $X(z)$ of the input signal $x(n) = -5^nu(-n-1)$, then calculated $Y_1(z) = H(z)X(z)$.
</p>
<p>
 For b), I am not sure how to proceed since the z-transform of $x(n) = 7$ does not seem to converge for any z.
</p>

  It should be $X ( z ) = \frac{z}{z - 5}$ with ROC $0 &lt; | z | &lt; 5$, and indeed $Y ( z ) = H ( z ) X ( z )$ and the ROC for that is the intersection of those of $X ( z )$ and $H ( z )$, namely $0.3 &lt; | z | &lt; 5$.
 </p>
 <p>
  In (b), $x$ has no $z$-transform --- it's a constant input signal --- specifically, $x ( n ) = 7 ( 1 ^ n )$ for all $n$, and since $1$ is in the ROC for $H ( z )$, we have $y _ 2 ( n ) = 7 H ( 1 ) ( 1 ^ n ) = 7 H ( 1 )$.  Many people opted to compute the convolution of $h$ with $x$ instead, which is also okay but more time-consuming.

   for part a X(z) should be z/(z+5) because the z transformation of the unit step is z/(z-a) where a = -5

    It's $- 5 ^ n u ( - n - 1 )$ rather than $- ( - 5 ) ^ n u ( - n - 1 )$.  The latter would go with $\frac{z}{z + 5}$ and ROC  $0  &lt; | z | &lt; 5$.
