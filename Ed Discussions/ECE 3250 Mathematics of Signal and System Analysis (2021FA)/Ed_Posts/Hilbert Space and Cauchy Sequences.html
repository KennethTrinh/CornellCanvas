  "If, in addition, every Cauchy sequence in V converges, V is called a Hilbert space." page 129 of the monograph. Does that mean that there are Cauchy sequences that don't converge? Or maybe I'm not very clear on what a Cauchy sequence is... My understanding of a Cauchy sequence is when the elements get closer and closer together. Is that not considered converging?

  We met Cauchy sequences talking about rationals and reals.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  There are Cauchy sequences of rational numbers that don't converge to a rational number ---- if you think of the rational numbers as "all available numbers," those Cauchy sequences just don't converge. --- the set of rational numbers isn't big enough to contain limits for all its Cauchy sequences.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  On the other hand, every Cauchy sequence of real numbers converges to a real number, so the set of real numbers is big enough in that way.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Think of an inner product space $V$ with non-converging Cauchy sequences as kind of like the rational numbers -- it's not big enough to have limits for all its Cauchy sequnces.  Think of a Hilbert space as kind of like the real numbers --- it's big enough to have limits for all its Cauchy sequences.
