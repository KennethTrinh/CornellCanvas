 "If, in addition, every Cauchy sequence in V converges, V is called a Hilbert space." page 129 of the monograph. Does that mean that there are Cauchy sequences that don't converge? Or maybe I'm not very clear on what a Cauchy sequence is... My understanding of a Cauchy sequence is when the elements get closer and closer together. Is that not considered converging?

  We met Cauchy sequences talking about rationals and reals.

  There are Cauchy sequences of rational numbers that don't converge to a rational number ---- if you think of the rational numbers as "all available numbers," those Cauchy sequences just don't converge. --- the set of rational numbers isn't big enough to contain limits for all its Cauchy sequences.

  On the other hand, every Cauchy sequence of real numbers converges to a real number, so the set of real numbers is big enough in that way.

  Think of an inner product space $V$ with non-converging Cauchy sequences as kind of like the rational numbers -- it's not big enough to have limits for all its Cauchy sequnces.  Think of a Hilbert space as kind of like the real numbers --- it's big enough to have limits for all its Cauchy sequences.
