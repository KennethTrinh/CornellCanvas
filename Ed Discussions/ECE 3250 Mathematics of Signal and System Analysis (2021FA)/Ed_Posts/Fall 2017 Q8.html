  My reasoning is that we are subtracting the projection of $v$ onto $\{w_1, w_2, w_3\}$ from $v$, so essentially we are subtracting the portions of $v$ that are parallel to $\{w_1, w_2, w_3\}$ from $v$, so we are left with a result that is orthogonal to $\{w_1, w_2, w_3\}$. My last conclusion may have been a stretch, but I believe that if a vector is orthogonal to $\{w_1, w_2, w_3\}$, then it is orthogonal to any linear combination of $\{w_1, w_2, w_3\}$.
