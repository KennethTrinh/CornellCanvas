  In 7, it states that Fermat's theorem is true whenever 1 &lt; k &lt;= p - 1.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  However, this assumption isn't made in 8.  Can we assume this is also true in #8, or are we supposed to apply it to k being an element of the natural numbers regardless of whether it is larger than p?

  The point of Problem 8 is that you can extend Fermat and Euler to apply to integers outside of $\mathbb{Z} _ p$ and $\mathbb{Z} _ a$.
