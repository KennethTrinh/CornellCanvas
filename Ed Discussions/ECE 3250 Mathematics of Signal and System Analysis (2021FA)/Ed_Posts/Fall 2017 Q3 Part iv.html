  What is the best approach for evaluating this expression? Have others used simply the rules of modular arithmetic or applied Euler's theorem? When I applied Euler's theorem I got that the expression is equal to 14, not 1 (meaning the statement would be false)

  For part 4, I said true. Since 14 is coprime with 15, we can apply Euler's Theorem by breaking 64 into 2^6. So find mod(14^2)^6. First mod(14^2) = mod(196) = 1. mod(1^6) = mod(1) which is 1. So the statement is true
