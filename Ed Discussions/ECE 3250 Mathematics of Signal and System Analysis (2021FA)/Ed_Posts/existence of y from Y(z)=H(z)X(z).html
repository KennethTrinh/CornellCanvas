  Given Y(z) exists, can we also include that y exists? Given that the z transforms of H(z) and X(z) exist, does Y(z)=H(z)X(z) always exist? (or is there some case where the region of intersections of H and X are empty and Y(z) thus doesn't exist?)

  I think I get what you're asking even if you've phrased it awkwardly.

  If the ROC for $H ( z )$ intersects that of $X ( z )$, then $Y ( z ) = H ( z ) X ( z )$ has an ROC containing the intersection, and $y  = h * x$ exists.  If the ROC for $H ( z )$ doesn't intersect that of $X ( z )$, $h * x$ usually doesn't exist.
