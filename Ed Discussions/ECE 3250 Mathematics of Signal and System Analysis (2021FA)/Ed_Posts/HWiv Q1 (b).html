  When it says find S(x), does it mean find S(x)(n) = h*x (n) or just S(x) = h*x? If it's just S(x) then do we leave it in the form of a sum? How would you reduce it any further from that without a parameter n?

  Go for a formula for $S ( x ) ( n )$ for all $n \in \mathbb{Z}$.  I think you can get rid of all summation signs.
