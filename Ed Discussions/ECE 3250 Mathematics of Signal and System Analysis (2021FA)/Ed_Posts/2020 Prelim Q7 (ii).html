  I don't understand why the limit would equal root(2).
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Couldn't Xn equal a number slightly larger than root(2) for x even, but equal something like -3 for x odd.  Then wouldn't the limit be less than root(2)?.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Why would the limit be exactly root(2) if the values Xn can fall anywhere rational in ( root(2) , pi ) for even, and ( -pi , root(2) ) for odd?

  If the limit is slightly larger than $\sqrt{2}$, say $\sqrt{2} + \epsilon$, then because arbitrarily "late" terms are less than $\sqrt{2}$, the sequence never gets within $\epsilon$ of the limit and stays there.  Same works for if the limit were slightly below.
