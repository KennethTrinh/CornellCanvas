  Hello,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I am having trouble seeing why prelim 2 q9(iii) is true.   I see that q is the convolution of x with a pure sinusoid, so I know the convolution rule applies so we could try multiplying, but I am not sure what else to go on.

  Thank you in advance!

  You find that $q ( t ) = \widehat{X} ( 3 ) e ^ {j 3 t}$, so $q ( t )$ is never zero when $\widehat{X} ( 3 ) \neq 0$ and $q ( t )$ is always zero when $\widehat{X} ( 3 ) = 0$.

  how do we know that it is nonzero for every t?

  I do not understand the q(t) is never zero when X(3) not equal to 0 part

  $e ^ {j 3 t}$ has magnitude 1 for all $t$, so it's never zero.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The integral is a convolution --- it's the convolution of $x$ with $e ^ {j 3 t}$.

  also, can you understand this through convolution or is that just a coincidence that it looks like it?
