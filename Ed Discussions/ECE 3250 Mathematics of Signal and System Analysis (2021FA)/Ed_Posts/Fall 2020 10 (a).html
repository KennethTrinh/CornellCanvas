 For this question, can we just use S1(delta) = h1? I am not sure how to do this without using delta but I think delta is actually undefined in continuous time

  You're supposed to recognize the system as an averager, which we've discussed at length, but you can find $h _ 1$ by plugging $x = \delta$ into the integral and maybe using the "rigorous interpretation" of initegrals with $\delta$'s in them.
