  I don't know if this question will make sense because I think there's a fundamental misunderstanding somewhere.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If x and y are in l2, the inner product between both is defined sum of x*(complex conj y) for every k value. So the l2 norm of one signal, x, is the sqrt of the squared sum at every k value

  If x has values in C, that means it can have value 1 at one k and value -i (since you're taking the complex conj) at another k.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The rules for an inner product are that for v in V, &lt;v,v&gt; cant equal 0 if v != 0. But wouldn't the l2 norm of a signal with 1 and -i equal 0?

  When you form the sum inside the sqyare root sign above, it's not $x _ i ^ 2$ but rather $| x _ i | ^ 2$.  Not sure where you got that equation from --- it's true when all the $x$-components are real, but not when they're complex.
