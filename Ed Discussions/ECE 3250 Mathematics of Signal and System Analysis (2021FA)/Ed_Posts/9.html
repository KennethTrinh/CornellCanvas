  I seem to have solved for the frequency response, but when plugging in k/T_0 for omega into the expression, I don't seem to be getting 0 instead a negative exponential e^-jk persists. Am I following the right approach or am I not using the correct discrete frequencies.

  You might be missing a factor of $2 \pi$ somewhere.

  Where would 2pi come from. Isn't it simply like problem 8 where you plug in the discrete frequencies into the frequency response and scale the existing coefficients of the fourier series of x? And when figuring out the frequency response, isn't it simply plugging in e^jomegat into the system. I don't seem to remember 2 pi being in any frequency response equation or fourier series or any where part of the problem

  Oh right fourier series definition. I apologize for not remembering that.
