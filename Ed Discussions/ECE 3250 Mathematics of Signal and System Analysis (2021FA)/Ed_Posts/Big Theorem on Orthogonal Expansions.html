  I was looking at the monograph's proof of the Big Theorem on Orthogonal Expansions (9.12 Theorem), and I am confused as to how the step below was made:

  In the highlighted line, how does the last equality hold? It seems to be saying that
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  $$\langle a+b,\ a+b\rangle =\left\Vert a^2 \right\Vert+\left\Vert b^2\right\Vert$$
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  which I thought wasn't true in general, since when I multiplied it out I got
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  $$\langle a+b,\ a+b\rangle =\left\Vert a^2 \right\Vert+ 2Re\{\langle a,\ b\rangle\} +\left\Vert b^2\right\Vert$$

  When $v$ and $w$ are orthogonal,$\langle v + w , v + w \rangle = \| v \| ^ 2 + \| w \| ^ 2$.  That's the key here --- $S _ n ( v )$ is orthogonal to $v - S _ n ( v )$.
