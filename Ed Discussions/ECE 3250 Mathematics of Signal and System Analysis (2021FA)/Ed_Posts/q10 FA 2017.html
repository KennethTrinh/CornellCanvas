  How was $h_1(t)$ determined in part a? I tried plugging in $\lim_{a -&gt; 0}\frac{1}{a}p_a(t)$ but was unable to simplify the integral. In general, how does one determine the impulse response given $S(x)$, for both strictly (and non strictly) convolutional systems?

  You're supposed to look at it and know it's an averager.  You can do the $p _ a$ thing, as well, and you'll get essentially the same thing, as follows:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  $\lim _ {a \rightarrow 0} \frac{1}{a} \int _ {t - 14} ^ t p _ a ( \tau ) d \tau = \left \{ \begin{array}{cl} 1 &amp; {\rm whem} \; t - 14 &lt; 0 &lt; t \\ 0 &amp; {\rm when} \; 0 &lt; t - 14 \; {\rm or} \; t &lt; 0 \end{array} \right .$
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  and it comes out to $1 / 2$ when $t = 0$ or $t - 14 = 0$.
