  Hi,

 <paragraph>
  For part (iv) with the sin function, I know that we will get the same values repeated when you evaluate the sin term, but i was wondering if you could still do a mapping (n-&gt; sin(npi/2) ) for all n in Z that would be bijective?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I am confused on the "all numbers of the form" part - do we mean a finite set {-1,1,0} or a set that contains repeated values?  eg. {0,1,-1,0,0, ...}.  because if a set does not allow repeated values, then the set is finite, so not countably infinite

  All numbers of the form means here the finite set you describe above.
