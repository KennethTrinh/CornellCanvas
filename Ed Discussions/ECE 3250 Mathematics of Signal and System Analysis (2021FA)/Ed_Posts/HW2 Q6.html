  For both parts of question 6, is it ok to just explain in words based on the definitions of subsets, bounded, and inf/sup why these statements are true? I feel like the arguments for parts a and b are pretty similar and I'm not sure if there is a more concrete approach besides explaining in words?

  No bright line exists between "explain in words" and "prove," but if you showed me an explanation in words, I could tell you whether I thought it sufficed.
