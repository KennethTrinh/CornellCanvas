  Since
  <code>
   p
  </code>
  is prime and larger than 2 we know that
  <code>
   p-1
  </code>
  must be even, or it would be divisible by 2.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  This tells us that the set
  <code>
   Z*_(p-1)
  </code>
  can't contain any even number that is a multiple of 2 because it is the set of all co-primes with
  <code>
   p-1
  </code>
  . Therefore, e and d must both be odd.

  EXAMPLE:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  p=5 (a prime number)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  p-1=4 (even)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Z_(p-1) = {0,1,2,3}
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Z*_(p-1) = {1,3}
