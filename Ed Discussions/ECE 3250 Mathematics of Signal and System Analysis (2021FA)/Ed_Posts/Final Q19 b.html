  You need to figure out a scheme where all signals get pulse-sampled faster than their Nyquist rates.  Two signals have the same Nyquist rate and the third has twice that Nyquist rate.  The first two just need to be sampled every. one cycle through the switch terminals, but the third needs to be sampled twice every cycle, and the samples need to be separated so they're only two "terminal hits" apart.
