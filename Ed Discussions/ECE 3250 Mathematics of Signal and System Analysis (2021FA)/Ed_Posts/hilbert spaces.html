  are all vectors/signals in a hilbert space square integrable? what if the inner product of the space was defined like $\int x(t)^{1/2} \overline{y(t)^{1/2}}$, would we now require all vectors in the space to be absolutely integrable?

  I think L2 is it's own hilbert space from what I understand.

  Hilbert spaces don't have to be sets of signals.  Like, $\mathbb{C} ^ n$ is a Hilbert space.

  Do all the entities in these hilbert spaces we consider have to be square integrable though? I'm trying to justify why $||v||^2$ is a valid upper bound in #245

  "Square integrable" has meaning only when you're talking about continuous-time signals.
