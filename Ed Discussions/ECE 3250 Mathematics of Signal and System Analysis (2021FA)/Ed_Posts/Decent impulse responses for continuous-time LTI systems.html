  Is the impulse response for a continuous-time LTI system guaranteed to be decent? If not, is there a way to tell if it is?

  I am confused as to how to know whether h1 and h2 are decent signals in Homework VI, question 6, which I think is needed to show the overall system is BIBO stable in part d.

  The general form of the impulse response of a continuous-time system (for us) is a decent signal plus possibly a few impulses --- see Standing Assumption at bottom of page 113 in the monograph.  Furthermore, BIBO stability demands only that the "decent part" of the system's impulse response be an $L ^ 1$-signal.
