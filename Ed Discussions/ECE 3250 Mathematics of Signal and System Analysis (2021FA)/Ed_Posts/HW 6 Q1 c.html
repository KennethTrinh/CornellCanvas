 Since all of the instances of t are t-7, should we write this signal as h(t-7) and then replace all the t-7's with t's? I'm not sure if that would be helpful or if it is just easier to work with the signal as it is?

  When I do the problem taking into account what we've done in class so far, I just work with the signals as they are.  If you wanted to do something more clever, you could use the fact (which we haven't emphasized) that
 </p>
 <p>
  $\left ( {\rm Shift} _ {t _ o} ( x _ 1 ) \right )  * x _ 2 = {\rm Shift} _ {t _ o} \left ( x _ 1 * x _ 2  \right )$
 </p>
 <p>
  when $x _ 1 * x _ 2$ exists.

   If we use the approach where we take the limit as a-&gt;0 when taking the convolution of the shifted impulse and x, would a just be 0 since it is just an impulse with very short duration?

    Remember there's a $\frac{1}{a}$ in front of the integral.
