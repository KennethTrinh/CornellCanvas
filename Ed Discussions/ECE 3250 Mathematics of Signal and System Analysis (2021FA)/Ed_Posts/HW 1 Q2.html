 In this question, we are asked if a choice function exists for all sets A. I proposed the case where A = {}, the empty set. In this case, P_0(A) would not include any elements. However, wouldn't that just mean that P_0(A) is the empty set? I guess the root of my question is what is the difference between the power set not existing and being the empty set?

  The power set of $A$ always exists, but if $A = \phi$ the power set is just $\{ \phi \}$ and $\mathcal{P} _ 0 ( A )$ is $\phi$, so a choice function doesn't exist.  The Axiom of Choice actually says a choice function exists for every
  <i>
   nonempty
  </i>
  set --- I'll fix the problem so it says that.
