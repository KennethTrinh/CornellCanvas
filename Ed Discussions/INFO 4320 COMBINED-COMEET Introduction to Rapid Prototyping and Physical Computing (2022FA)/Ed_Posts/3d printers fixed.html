  Almost half of the printers are not working properly--do you know when will the printers be fixed?

  We reported the printer's issues last week. We were told they were all fixed by Nov 18th.  These new issues likely happened during the weekend. We have reported to the maintenance team who will try to fix them ASAP.

  BTW, if you can posted the number of the printer or take a picture of the printer that would make the repair process easier too. Thanks.
