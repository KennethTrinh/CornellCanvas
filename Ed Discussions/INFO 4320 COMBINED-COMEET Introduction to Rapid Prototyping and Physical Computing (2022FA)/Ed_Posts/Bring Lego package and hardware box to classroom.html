 Hi Everyone,
</p>
<p>
 Please make sure you bring in the Lego Package and also the hardware box (including ESP32 and Cable) to the classroom today.
</p>
<p>
 We will work on setting up the WIFI on ESP32 and building moving mechanisms in tomorrow's class.
</p>
<p>
 If you did not receive the Lego package, please let us know. We can bring some extra to the class tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
 Thank you.
</p>
