 Based on what I can tell from file names and the shape of the parts on the print bed, over half of the currently functional printers (4/7) in Rhodes 114 are printing versions of the exact same file. I understand the need to get parts ready by tomorrow, but this leaves the rest of us with limited options to get our parts that we need ready for the same deadline.Â Please use fewer printers at once.
