 I'm a bit confused with the reference format. I've been putting superscript number on where it is referenced in the order of where each of them appear in the paper, the the format says to order in alphabetical order. Should we change the order of the number of the superscript so that the numbers under the reference can be in order? or should I do the other way? and also, what does it mean to be referenced by numbers in brackets [1,3,4]?

  Use a numbered list of references at the end of the article, ordered alphabetically by last name of first author, and referenced by numbers in brackets [1,3,4]."

  Dont worry about the order of reference. You will not lose points for this.
