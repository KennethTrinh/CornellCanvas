 Hello, about half of your 2nd round orders have arrived. We have sorted them out and directly put them in your boxes in 129 if we can find them. If we did not find your box, we marked the packages with team number on them and put them on a chair in 129. We will keep distributing items as soon as they arrive, please keep an eye on your team's box. Thank you.
