  As we discussed in class, the majority of 3D printing errors happen in the first 5-10 mins. I noticed most of the failed printing tasks did not finish the first layer.

  Therefore, after you start printing your design,
  <bold>
   please stay there until it finishes the first layer ( usually about 3-5 mins).
  </bold>
  This would help save your time as well as resources.
