 As we discussed in class, the majority of 3D printing errors happen in the first 5-10 mins. I noticed most of the failed printing tasks did not finish the first layer.
</p>
<p>
 Therefore, after you start printing your design,
 <b>
  please stay there until it finishes the first layer ( usually about 3-5 mins).
 </b>
 This would help save your time as well as resources.

 Thank you.
