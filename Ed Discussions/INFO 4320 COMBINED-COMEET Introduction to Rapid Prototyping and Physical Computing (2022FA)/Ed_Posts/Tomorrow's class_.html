 Tomorrow's class will be critical for your team project this semester.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  If you have not found a team,
 </b>
 we will help you find one.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  If you have formed a team,
 </b>
 we will give you feedbacks to consolidate the idea to make sure it is feasible and within the scope of the course.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  If you are not sure whether you have the coding skills to take the course,
 </b>
 we can discuss it with you in more detail with example codes.
</p>

 See you tomorrow.
