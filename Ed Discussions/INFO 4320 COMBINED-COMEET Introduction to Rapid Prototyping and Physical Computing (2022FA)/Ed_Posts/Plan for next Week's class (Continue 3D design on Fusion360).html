  Next week, we will continue working on using Fusion 360 for 3D design.  Therefore, you do not need to bring in your hardware to the classroom.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  A reminder that 1 ) the first prototype for the team project and 2) the design project 2 will be due on Nov 7th.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <bold>
   To balance the workload, the complexity of mini-projects in the next two weeks will remain low, so that you can have more time to work on your design and team projects.

 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Please make sure to start your projects early so that we can better support you.
