<p>
 Next week, we will continue working on using Fusion 360 for 3D design.  Therefore, you do not need to bring in your hardware to the classroom.
</p>
<p>
 A reminder that 1 ) the first prototype for the team project and 2) the design project 2 will be due on Nov 7th.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  To balance the workload, the complexity of mini-projects in the next two weeks will remain low, so that you can have more time to work on your design and team projects.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 Please make sure to start your projects early so that we can better support you.
</p>
<p>
 Feel free to let us know if you have any questions.
