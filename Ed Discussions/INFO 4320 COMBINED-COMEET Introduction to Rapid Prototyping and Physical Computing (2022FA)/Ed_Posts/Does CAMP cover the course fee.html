 I was wondering if the CAMP program run by Cornell covers the course fee attached to this class. I was under the impression that the CAMP program was implemented to "provid[e] all required course materials for a semester fee" and because the course fee is to cover required materials I would think it might be covered. I'm unsure of this and would like to check before I decide to opt-in or out.

  I checked with the department. The answer is that it probably won't cover the course fee for this course. Here is what we found. Feel free to send an email to the address below to get more info.
