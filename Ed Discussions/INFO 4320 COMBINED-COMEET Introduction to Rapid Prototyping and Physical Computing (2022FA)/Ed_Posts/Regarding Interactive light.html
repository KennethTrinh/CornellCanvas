 Is the Triple Color LED the same as the LED we used in IR sensor assignment, the RGB LED? The link on canvas is broken, so just wanted to confirm.
</p>
<p>
 Also should the LED color be the main focus of the design project, or can it just be a part of the design without being the focal point?
</p>
<p>
 Also, does the environment have to be strictly random or can it respond to human interaction with other components as well? For example, presses on the keypad.

  Is the RGB LED.

  The LED color does not have to be the main focus of the project.
 </p>
 <p>
  Your project can respond to human interaction and is not limited to environments only.
