 Hi, everyone
</p>
<p>
 I am YuanChen Tao and I'm looking for one group member familiar with anime or ACG-related fields. We are thinking of using 3D printing to create one or more anime figures starting from modeling, printing, coloring, and final assembly. Depending on the time and pace, we may also try to add interactive lighting corresponding to movements or time.
</p>
<p>
 Now, the group has two members including Enya and me. We're both graduate students with CS majoring during undergrad. I also have experience using Arduino while Enya has experience in media designing. So it will be fun and entertaining doing this project.
</p>
<p>
 So if anyone is interested, please free to leave a comment or email me. My email address is yt596@cornell.edu
</p>
<p>
 Best,
</p>
<p>
 YuanChen
