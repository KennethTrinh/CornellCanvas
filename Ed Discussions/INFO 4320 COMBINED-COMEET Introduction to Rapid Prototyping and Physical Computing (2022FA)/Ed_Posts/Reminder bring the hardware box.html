 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 Some of you forgot to bring in all the hardware boxes in last week's class.
</p>
<p>
 Please make sure you bring in all the hardware boxes (e.g., sensor box, cable box) to class tomorrow.  The only box we will not need tomorrow is the Lego box.
</p>

 Please note this is the default requirement for all our lectures this semester. I will send out a notification in advance if we will not work on hardware.
