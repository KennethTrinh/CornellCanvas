  For design project 3, I know we are allowed to recreate a project found online as long as we do everything ourselves. I also know we need at least 6 different unique pieces. For my project, I found another online project to go off of, but there are a few pieces that are very complicated and will be difficult for me to recreate. For these, am I allowed to directly copy/paste from the source project if there are still 6 other unique pieces I will make from scratch?

  Sorry. You are not allowed to directly copy and paste from the source project.  The idea is not to completely replicate another project. Instead, use other projects as the inspiration for your own design.

  You can either revise the design by yourself or consider other design opportunities.
