 I'm working on the projecting heart right now,,, but I think I forgot how to do the projecting. I did finish making heart and extruded it. What was the way to do the projection on an offset plane??

  You need to create a 2D sketch on the offset plane first. Then under the 2D sketch interface, you can choose the function of "project" .  If you still need help. feel free to stop by OH today.
