 Just want to provide another update on 3D printers.
</p>
<p>
 The maintenance team was able to fix 4 printers this morning.  Now,  we have in total of
 <b>
  10 printers
 </b>
 in Rhodes 114 that are working.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Just a reminder: please stay for the first 3-5 mins after your printing job starts.  This would prevent many of the jamming issues.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 Thank you.
