  Just want to provide another update on 3D printers.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The maintenance team was able to fix 4 printers this morning.  Now,  we have in total of
  <bold>
   10 printers
  </bold>
  in Rhodes 114 that are working.

   Just a reminder: please stay for the first 3-5 mins after your printing job starts.  This would prevent many of the jamming issues.
