  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  We will not teach any new content in tomorrow's class.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  As we announced on Monday, we will use the class time to provide support for students on their projects including mini projects, design projects, or team projects.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Please use these times to get feedback on your projects and get hands-on support from the teaching team.
