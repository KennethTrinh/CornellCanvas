 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 We will not teach any new content in tomorrow's class.
</p>
<p>
 As we announced on Monday, we will use the class time to provide support for students on their projects including mini projects, design projects, or team projects.
</p>
<p>
 Please use these times to get feedback on your projects and get hands-on support from the teaching team.
</p>
