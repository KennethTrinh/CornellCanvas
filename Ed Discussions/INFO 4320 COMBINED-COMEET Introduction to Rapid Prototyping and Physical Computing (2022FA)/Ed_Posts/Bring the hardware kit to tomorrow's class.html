 Hi Everyone,
</p>
<p>
 Please bring
 <b>
  your hardware kit to the class tomorrow.
 </b>
 We will start work on how to communicate with sensors through a more advanced communication protocol (I2C) in the class.
</p>
<p>
 1.  There is
 <b>
  no mini-project
 </b>
 due this week.
</p>
<p>
 2. The knowledge we teach tomorrow will be used for the mini-project
 <b>
  next week.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 3. The rest of the class time will be used to provide feedback and support you on design project two if you have not finished them.
</p>
