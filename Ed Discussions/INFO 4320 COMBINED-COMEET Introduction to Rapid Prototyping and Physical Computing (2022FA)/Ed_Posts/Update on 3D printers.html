 Hi Everyone,
</p>
<p>
 I just want to give you an update on the 3D printers in Rhodes 114.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  What happened:
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Nov 18
 </b>
 : The 10 3D printers are maintained by a staff member. He has fixed the issues on all of them by last Friday (Nov 18th) before he went for vacation.  They were all working on Friday as seen by TAs.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Nov 19-20
 </b>
 : Over the weekend, we received reports that 3D printers were not working. We checked them today and found 6 of them were not working properly. This is the first time we have had 6 printers all stop working in 2 days. Usually, we only had 1-2 printers not working at a time in the past semesters.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  What we have done to fix this issue:
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 1. We have reported this issue to the maintenance team. One staff member was in Rhodes 114 the entire afternoon to look into the issues and have identified the issues.   Tomorrow, we will have two staff members come to the lab in the morning to fix them as much as possible.
</p>
<p>
 2. We have moved 2 additional 3D printers (originally for research purposes) from Gates to Rhodes hall this evening.  This will add the total number of 3D printers in Rhodes to 114 to 12.
</p>
<p>
 3.
 <b>
  We use post-it notes to distinguish the functioning printers from the ones not working properly.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  What's next :
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 1. At this moment, there are
 <b>
  6 printers working properly
 </b>
 in Rhodes 114.
</p>
<p>
 2. The staff team will try to fix
 <b>
  the other 6 printers as much as possible tomorrow (Tuesday).
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 3. We will closely monitor the situation, keep you posted, and decide if any further operation is needed.
</p>
<p>
 I am sorry the 3D printers did not treat our class well this year.  If you have any further questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to us.
