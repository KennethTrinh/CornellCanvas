 Hi Everyone,
</p>
<p>
 As we approach the final week and demo day, I want to provide an update on the schedule for the rest of the semester.
</p>
<p>
 First, at this stage of the team project,
 <b>
  it is more important to complete a project with a working prototype (even with simple functions) than a complicated project where none of the functions work well.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 Second. We will send out a
 <b>
  peer evaluation form
 </b>
 tomorrow, due on Dec 11th.  This peer evaluation form will be considered while finalizing the grades.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  The schedule for the rest of the semester:
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Dec 5:
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 Tomorrow will be our last class this semester. As I discussed in last week's class,  this class will be used as a workshop session.  Given the approaching DDL on demo day, attending this class
 <b>
  is required.
 </b>
 We will use this class time to work on team projects in Rhodes hall and Upson hall.
 <b>
  If you can not attend tomorrow's class, you must explain the reason and acquire permission from the instructor in advance.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
