  Hi Everyone,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  As we approach the final week and demo day, I want to provide an update on the schedule for the rest of the semester.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  First, at this stage of the team project,
  <bold>
   it is more important to complete a project with a working prototype (even with simple functions) than a complicated project where none of the functions work well.
  </bold>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Second. We will send out a
  <bold>
   peer evaluation form
  </bold>
  tomorrow, due on Dec 11th.  This peer evaluation form will be considered while finalizing the grades.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <bold>
   The schedule for the rest of the semester:
  </bold>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <bold>
   Dec 5:
  </bold>

 <paragraph>
  Tomorrow will be our last class this semester. As I discussed in last week's class,  this class will be used as a workshop session.  Given the approaching DDL on demo day, attending this class
  <bold>
   is required.
  </bold>
  We will use this class time to work on team projects in Rhodes hall and Upson hall.
  <bold>
   If you can not attend tomorrow's class, you must explain the reason and acquire permission from the instructor in advance.
