  Hi Everyone,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  We received reports from students that the hardware components (Rhodes 129 or 114) in their design project or team project disappeared in the past week. Some projects were clearly marked with "Do not touch" signs.  Losing these hardware components has significantly impacted their progress on the assignment.

   Please DO NOT take any hardware components if they are not yours in 114 and 129.
  </bold>
  The only components that are shared with all students are the ones placed in the bins in Rhodes 114.  If you are not sure whether certain hardware components are free to take, p
  <bold>
   lease check with the teaching team first before you take them.
