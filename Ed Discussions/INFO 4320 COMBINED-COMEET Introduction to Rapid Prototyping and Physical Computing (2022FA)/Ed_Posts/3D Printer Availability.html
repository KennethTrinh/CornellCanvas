  Hi, I just wanted to raise some concern I have about Design Project 3. I know we are told to start early because of back-up of the 3D printers, and I have really tried to start this project early in anticipation of this. Even with starting early, the printers are almost always full and/or broken. I was trying to complete the project before break and went to the lab multiple times this weekend, but I have not been able to get access to a working printer. I am now very concerned with finishing the design project and the final project after break since there is going to be such a high demand for 3D printing. How should we navigate completing both of the projects with a shortage of 3D printers?

  I am also having a similar issue, and feel like both these assignments are a bit difficult to complete with the state of the printers.
