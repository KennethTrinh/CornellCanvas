 Welcome back from the Thanksgiving break.
</p>
<p>
 We will work on our last mini-project (LED Matrix+ Keypad) tomorrow.  Please bring your hardware box (including the sensor box)  to class.
</p>
<p>
 We are closely monitoring the status of 3D printers.  Will provide more updates tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
 See you tomorrow.
