  Hi, I tried to print this morning but I could not load the 3d printer websites. Ive tried multiple ones and also tried with our school's computer, but still couldn't work.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  it just shows "this site cannot be reached"
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  anyone has encountered this before? I don't think its an internet issue or an issue w my computer since I've also tried using the desktop one in our lab too.

  Do you know which printer you are using?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Two printers were moved from Gates hall, which has not been setup correctly with Rhodes hall network.

  In this case, please use USB drive (mini printer) or SD card( prusa original printer) for print, which should always work.
