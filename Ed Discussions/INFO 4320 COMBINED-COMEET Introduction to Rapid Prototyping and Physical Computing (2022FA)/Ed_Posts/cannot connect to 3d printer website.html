 Hi, I tried to print this morning but I could not load the 3d printer websites. Ive tried multiple ones and also tried with our school's computer, but still couldn't work.
</p>
<p>
 it just shows "this site cannot be reached"
</p>
<p>
 anyone has encountered this before? I don't think its an internet issue or an issue w my computer since I've also tried using the desktop one in our lab too.
</p>

  Do you know which printer you are using?
 </p>
 <p>
  Two printers were moved from Gates hall, which has not been setup correctly with Rhodes hall network.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this case, please use USB drive (mini printer) or SD card( prusa original printer) for print, which should always work.
