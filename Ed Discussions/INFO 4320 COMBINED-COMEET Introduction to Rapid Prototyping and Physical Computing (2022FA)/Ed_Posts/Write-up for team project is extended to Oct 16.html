 The write-up for the team project (cardboard prototype) is extended to
 <b>
  Oct 16th.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 However, the card prototype is still due on
 <b>
  Oct 12th,
 </b>
 as each team needs to bring your cardboard prototype to the classroom for a demo.  I hope the change of deadline can help you to focus on building the prototype during a busy week.
</p>
<p>
 Please note that the individual design assignment (interactive lights) is due on
 <b>
  Oct 14
 </b>
 (won't be extended).
