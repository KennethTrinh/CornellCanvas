 Can someone put back the SD reader? There was only one available in the lab and it has gone missing. I'm unable to export my gcode onto a SD card.
</p>
<p>
 To staff, can more be provided?
</p>
<p>
 To students, considering using an USB for the mini printers instead of the SD card reader.

  Thanks for reporting this issue.

  We purchased a bunch of them at beginning of the semester. TA will check the room and see whether we can find more readers and put them in the room.
