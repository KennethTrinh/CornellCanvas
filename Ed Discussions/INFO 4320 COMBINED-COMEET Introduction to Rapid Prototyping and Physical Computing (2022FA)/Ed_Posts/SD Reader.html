  Can someone put back the SD reader? There was only one available in the lab and it has gone missing. I'm unable to export my gcode onto a SD card.

 <paragraph>
  To staff, can more be provided?

  To students, considering using an USB for the mini printers instead of the SD card reader.

  We purchased a bunch of them at beginning of the semester. TA will check the room and see whether we can find more readers and put them in the room.
