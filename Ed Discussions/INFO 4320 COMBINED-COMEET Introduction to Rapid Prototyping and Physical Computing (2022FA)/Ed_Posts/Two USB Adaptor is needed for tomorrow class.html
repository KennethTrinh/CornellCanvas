  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Sorry to send another email. We will need to connect two devices (1: EPS32, and 2: Logic Analyzer) via USB to your computer. Therefore,  if your computer does not have
  <bold>
   two USB ports
  </bold>
  , pls bring in
  <bold>
   two adaptors
  </bold>
  so that two USB devices can be connected to your computer at the same time.
