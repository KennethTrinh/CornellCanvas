 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 Sorry to send another email. We will need to connect two devices (1: EPS32, and 2: Logic Analyzer) via USB to your computer. Therefore,  if your computer does not have
 <b>
  two USB ports
 </b>
 , pls bring in
 <b>
  two adaptors
 </b>
 so that two USB devices can be connected to your computer at the same time.
</p>
<p>
 Thank you.
</p>
