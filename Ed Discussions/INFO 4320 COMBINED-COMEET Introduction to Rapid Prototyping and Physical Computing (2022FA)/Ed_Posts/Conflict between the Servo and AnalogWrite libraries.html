  Some of you met issues while trying to use the servo and LEDs, buzzers, or DC motor together. This issue is caused by conflict in the Servo and AnalogWrite libraries. There is a workaround to this issue - not using these two libraries and use the lower-level PWM library
  <code>
   ledc
  </code>
  instead.

  Here is a detailed tutorial on how to use
  <code>
   ledc
  </code>
  instead of
  <code>
   analogWrite
  </code>
  to control LEDs. It can be used to control buzzers too.
