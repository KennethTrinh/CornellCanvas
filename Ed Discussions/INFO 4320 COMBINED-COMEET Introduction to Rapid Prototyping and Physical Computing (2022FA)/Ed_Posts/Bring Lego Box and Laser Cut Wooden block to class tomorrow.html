 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 We will work on the last section of the moving mechanism in tomorrow's class using Lego.
</p>
<p>
 Please make sure that you bring in both
 <b>
  Lego Box
 </b>
 as well as
 <b>
  the two wooden pieces(See picture below)
 </b>
 made during the laser cutter training to the classroom.
</p>
<p>
 We will have some time left at the end of the class, during which we are happy to answer any of your questions on your design or team projects.
</p>
<p>
 Please note that I will be traveling for a conference next week. If you want to get my input on your projects, tomorrow will be a good time.

   You should have received these two pieces during your laser cutter training.
