 I had a question what we need to do for the animated steam engine assignment due tonight. The instruction says: “Stop the motor after one turn and change the motor direction.” Is the one turn referring to the wheel or the motor? I’m wondering whether I have to change the number for the given
 <code>
  full_turn_count
 </code>
 .

  One turn refers to the wheel, not the motor.
 </p>
 <p>
  You need to use the sensor to detect the position of the wheel.
 </p>
 <p>
  You may need to use the screwdriver  to adjust the sensitivity of the sensor.

   Another question, is the assignment asking for
  </p>
  <p>
   1) go forward, break for 5 seconds, and switch directions
  </p>
  <p>
   or
  </p>
  <p>
   2) go forward, switch directions, and break for 5 seconds?
  </p>

  I think it's asking you to move the wheel clockwise / counterclockwise for one cycle, then break for ~5 seconds, then move the wheel (counter)clockwise for another cycle.
 </p>
 <p>
  You may want to adjust
  <code>
   full_turn_count
  </code>
  .
