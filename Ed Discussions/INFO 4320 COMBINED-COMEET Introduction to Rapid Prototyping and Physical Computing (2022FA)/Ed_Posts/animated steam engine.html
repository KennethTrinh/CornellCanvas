  I had a question what we need to do for the animated steam engine assignment due tonight. The instruction says: “Stop the motor after one turn and change the motor direction.” Is the one turn referring to the wheel or the motor? I’m wondering whether I have to change the number for the given
  <code>
   full_turn_count
  </code>
  .

  One turn refers to the wheel, not the motor.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  You need to use the sensor to detect the position of the wheel.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  You may need to use the screwdriver  to adjust the sensitivity of the sensor.

  I think it's asking you to move the wheel clockwise / counterclockwise for one cycle, then break for ~5 seconds, then move the wheel (counter)clockwise for another cycle.

 <paragraph>
  You may want to adjust
  <code>
   full_turn_count
  </code>
