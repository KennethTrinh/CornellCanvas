 Hi,

 You can use tomorrow's class to:

<p>
 1. Get help to answer your questions on this week's mini-project.
</p>
<p>
 2. Get feedback on your design project 3.

<p>
 3. Get feedback on your team project.

  I have uploaded all slides to canvas, which we will use for the last 2 mini projects.
 </b>
 If you have finished this week's mini-project, and want to start working on next week's mini-project early, you can do that as well.
