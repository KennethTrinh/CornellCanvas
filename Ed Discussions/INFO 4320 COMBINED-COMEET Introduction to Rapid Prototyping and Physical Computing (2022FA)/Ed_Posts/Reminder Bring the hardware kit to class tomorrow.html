  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  We will work on the hardware again tomorrow. Please make sure you bring in your hardware box and your USB adaptor (if you need one) to class tomorrow.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  WE will not use the Lego box though. If you want to save some weight, you can safely leave Lego Box at home for tomorrow's class.

 <paragraph>
  See you in class.
