 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 We will work on the hardware again tomorrow. Please make sure you bring in your hardware box and your USB adaptor (if you need one) to class tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
 WE will not use the Lego box though. If you want to save some weight, you can safely leave Lego Box at home for tomorrow's class.
</p>
<p>
 See you in class.
</p>
