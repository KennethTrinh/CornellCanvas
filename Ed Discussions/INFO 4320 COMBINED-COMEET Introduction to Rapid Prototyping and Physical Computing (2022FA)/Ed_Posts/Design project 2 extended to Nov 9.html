 We received reports that the laser cutter stopped working today.  We are actively working with the maintenance team to fix this issue. Hopefully, this can be fixed on Monday.
</p>
<p>
 We understand that some of you still need the laser cutter to complete your project. Therefore, we decided to
 <b>
  extend the deadline to 23:59 on Nov 9th.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 We will keep you posted on the status of the laser cutter.
</p>
<p>
 Looking forward to your presentation and demo on Monday.

  just a side note, there are two 3d printers that weren't working properly when I was there like 2 hours ago, so it would be nice if they get fixed on Monday too!

   Update: Julian Prieto fixed the laser cutter. It should be working now. For all the troubles it caused, the extension will stand.
