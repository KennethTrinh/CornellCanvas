 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 We will continue to work on the mini project which we started in past Wed. We will need two USB ports to connect the micro controller and the
 <b>
  logic analyzer
 </b>
 at the same time today.
</p>
<p>
 In addition to your hardware kit (including logic analyzer), if your computer need adaptor for USB ports, please bring enough USB adaptors to the class.
</p>
<p>
 See you in class.
</p>
