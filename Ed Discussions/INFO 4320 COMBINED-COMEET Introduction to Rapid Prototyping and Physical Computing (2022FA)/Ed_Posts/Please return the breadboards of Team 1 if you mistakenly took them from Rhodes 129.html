 Team 1 reported that they lost 3 breadboards and the hardware components on them today (they were there yesterday). The breadboards were in and connected to the delivery robot they designed in Rhodes 129. If someone mistakenly took the breadboards from their robot, please return them to Rhodes 129

 Please note that, unlike Rhodes 114, the hardware components in Rhodes 129 are
 <b>
  NOT
 </b>
 supposed to be shared unless you get permission from TAs. Please do
 <b>
  NOT
 </b>
 take any hardware directly from other group's projects as well. Besides, the shared tools in 114 (e.g. SD cards, glue, screw drivers, etc.) should
 <b>
  NOT
 </b>
 be taken out of that room. We should work together to maintain a pleasant and convenient working environment. Thank you!
