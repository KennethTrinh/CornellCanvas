 Hi! I am looking for group members. Let's make something challenge and fun!
</p>
<p>
 I have two ideas: 1) Electric Skateboard, which can move and turn, or even do some stunts; 2) Vaccum Cleaner, similar to romba, which can clean the rooms or desks.
</p>
<p>
 I am a M.Eng ECE student and have a lot of experience in microcontroller programming, circuit design. Please contact me (lf355@cornell.edu) if you are interested, and I am also open to other ideas.
</p>
