  We have received complaints that SD card readers (as well as some other tools) are all gone. We have put some backup ones in Rhodes 114. Please
  <bold>
   DO NOT take them out of Rhodes 114
  </bold>
  . They are attached to the table so if you wish to use them, please bring your laptop to the table.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  This applies to other tools as well. They should stay in 114. If you wish to use them, please take your devices to 114. Please also
  <bold>
   put them back where you find them after use
  </bold>
  . If you need to use them shortly in 129, please
  <bold>
   be sure to return them to 114
  </bold>
  after use. We ask that everyone be considerate and responsible while using tools in the lab. Those are course resources and should be shared by everyone in the class. We should work together to maintain a pleasant working environment.
