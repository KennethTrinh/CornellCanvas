 Hi all,
</p>
<p>
 We will use next Wednesday's session to present your cardboard prototypes and get feedbacks. The 10 teams in the class will be divided in two groups. The teaching staff team will also be divided in two groups to watch your presentations respectively. The classroom will be divided in two areas as well. Teams in
 <b>
  group 1
 </b>
 <b>
  will sit
 </b>
 in the right part of the classroom (seen from the entrance) that is
 <b>
  near the entrance
 </b>
 . Teams in group 2 will sit in the left part of the classroom.
</p>
<p>
 Please bring your cardboard prototype to the classroom in advance. To reserve some time to setup the prototype, please arrive at least
 <b>
  5 minutes before the class begins
 </b>
 . The two groups will start in parallel. We will go through each team in the group one by one. Each team has
