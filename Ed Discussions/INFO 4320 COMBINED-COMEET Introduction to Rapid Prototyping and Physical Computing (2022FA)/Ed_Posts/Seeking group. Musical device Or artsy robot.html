  Hello :)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I am still looking to form a team. My first choice for a project is something music related. My idea was some kind of wearable musical glove, which would produce musical sounds depending on the position of your hand and fingers. There were also some ideas on the board about musical shoes, or a device which produces sound when you work out/dance. Any of these sound very fun to me. I’m not too picky about the specifics yet.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I’d also be interested in hearing other ideas from people looking to form or fill out a group.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I have a pretty strong background in C and C++ programming, experience with analog and digital circuit design, and a well stocked electronics lab in my house which I use for personal/hobby projects.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If anyone wants to collaborate on some kind of physical musical interface as described, or if you’re trying to find another member for your group and it seems like I’d be a good fit, let me know!

  Cheers,
