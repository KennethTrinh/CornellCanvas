  Hi all,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  We distributed the hardware components for your group projects in separate boxes and have placed them in Rhodes 129. Please feel free to go there and pick up your hardware. You can just store them in the room as well. We labeled each box with your group number so please do not take items from other group's boxes. Please refer to the following post for your group number if you don't know it.

  There are some components that have not arrived. We will distribute them to you and let you know as soon as we get them. In the meantime, we encourage you to start working on your group projects early with the hardware you have right now.
