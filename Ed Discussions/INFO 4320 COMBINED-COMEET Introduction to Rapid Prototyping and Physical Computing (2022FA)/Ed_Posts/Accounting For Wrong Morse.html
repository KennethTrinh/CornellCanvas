 Should our design account for errors in the Morse input? For example, if we receive two dots, then a dash, then two dots, should our design not change the fan speed and output that the input does not correlate to a number. Or should we assume that our input will always be correct?

  You can assume your input is correct. In your demo video, you only need to show the required sequence.

  We do not require you need to handle error input.
