  Hi Everyone,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <bold>
   3D printers update:
  </bold>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The maintenance staff was able to repair all four 3D printers which were not working properly on Sunday.  Now, we should have 10 printers working in the lab.  If you see any printer that is not working or needs filament, please feel free to let one of us know. We will try to fix them ASAP.

   Design project 3:
  </bold>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  As discussed in today's class, you will have more time to print out your design project 3 using the 3D printers, due to an unexpected number of printers not working properly before and after Thanksgiving.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1. You still need to submit your design files on design project 3 by the original due date of
  <bold>
   12/1.
  </bold>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. However, you will have until
  <bold>
   12/9
  </bold>
  to print your design using 3D printers. You need to submit demo videos and pictures to Canvas.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I hope this new arrangement can help you balance the usage of 3D printers between the design project and the team project.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If you have any further questions, feel free to let us know.  Thank you.

  For the first requirement outlined on canvas, "several views illustrating the model design", what is this referring to specifically? do we need to assemble the components to show what the final model looks like in Fusion?

  You dont have to assemble them togehter on Fusion. You just need to submit a few screenshots of your design from different view of angles.
