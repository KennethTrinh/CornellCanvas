  Hi all,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I hope you are doing well!
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Instead of asking you to find a TA based on your schedules, we have assigned each team with two TA mentors. You can find the assignment in
  <link href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u-g0KYy3o539fZ6-fpXREW7uCK6uf6qI61xt77OKEWU/edit?usp=sharing"/>
  this document (after your team number). However, you still need to figure out a weekly meeting time with your TAs and include it in your project description submission
  <bold>
   before next Monday
  </bold>
  . The meeting is usually around
  <bold>
   15 minutes
  </bold>
  each week. We encourage you to
  <link href="https://join.slack.com/t/info43205321fall22/shared_invite/zt-1enenffeu-eN38Wq_m5Jsu4WSNcGsVMw"/>
  join the course slack to communicate with your TAs if you have not done so.
