 Hi all,
</p>
<p>
 I hope you are doing well!
</p>
<p>
 Instead of asking you to find a TA based on your schedules, we have assigned each team with two TA mentors. You can find the assignment in

  this document
  (after your team number). However, you still need to figure out a weekly meeting time with your TAs and include it in your project description submission
  <b>
   before next Monday
  </b>
  . The meeting is usually around
  <b>
   15 minutes
  </b>
  each week. We encourage you to

 to communicate with your TAs if you have not done so.
</p>
<p>
 Please let us know if you are still having trouble forming a team. We will help you find your team.
</p>
<p>
 Feel free to let us know if you have any questions.
