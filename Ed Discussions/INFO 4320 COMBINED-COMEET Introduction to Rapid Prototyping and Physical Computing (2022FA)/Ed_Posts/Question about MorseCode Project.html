 On the assignment, it says to film the video with "
 <i>
  Logic analyzer operation showing LED signal."
 </i>
 What is the logic analyzer operation referring to? Specifically, what do we need to film?

  Thanks for catching this. As discussed on Wed, this requirement has been removed.

  I just deleted this on canvas assignment too.
