 Are we allowed to 3D print small pieces for our Jack in the Box to aid with the motors? It says in the instructions that all mechanisms must be laser cut, so I just wanted to clarify. Thanks!

  You need to use a user laser cutter for this part. Unless you can justify why it can not be done with laser cut.
