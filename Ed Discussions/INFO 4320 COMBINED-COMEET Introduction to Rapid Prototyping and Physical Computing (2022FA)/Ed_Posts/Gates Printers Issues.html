 If you are printing on the two new printers brought from Gates, I thought you might want to know that your prints are now stopped:
</p>
<p>
 1. All the filaments were attached to the printer head. I've canceled the print

 2. The print had stopped midway and this error messages shows. It looked fine so I pressed "Yes" but the printer made some weird noises and the error message popped up again after around 2 minutes.
