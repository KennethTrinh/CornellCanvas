 Hi, the laser cutter isn't working anymore. It kept showing XY axis disabled. I looked up with another classmate and realized that there's probably something that's wrong with its motor. How can we solve it and is still possible to print over the weekend?

 Thanks!

  I just fixed the laser cutter. The bed was jammed into the tool and it couldn't calibrate. There's a panel on the front of the laser cutter that gives you access to the belt that lifts the bed so I just pulled the bed down while it was off, restarted it, and it worked. An extension on the assignment would still very much be appreciated because the laser cutter was out of commission for so long.
