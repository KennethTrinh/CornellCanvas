 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 Tomorrow we will start working on 3D design and printing using AutoDesk Fusion 360.  Two things to prepare for the class:
</p>
<p>
 1. Please install the software (
 <b>
  AutoDesk Fusion 360
 </b>
 ) before the class. Cornell has an educational license for the software for all students and faculty, as detailed below:

 </a>
</p>
<p>
 2. You do not need to bring in the hardware box for tomorrow's class, as we will not work on hardware in the following two weeks.  We will focus on 3D printing in the next two weeks.
</p>
<p>
 Thanks.
