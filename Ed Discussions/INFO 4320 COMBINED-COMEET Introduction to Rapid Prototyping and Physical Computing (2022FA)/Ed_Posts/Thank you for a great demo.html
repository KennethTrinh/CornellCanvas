 Hi Everyone,
</p>
<p>
 Thanks to everyone for a great demo session on Tuesday. Just a final reminder to wrap up the semester.
</p>
<p>
 1. If you want to take the team project with you,
 <b>
  you are welcome to do so before Dec 15
 </b>
 . After that date, all hardware left in Rhodes 114 and 129 will be recycled for future students.
</p>
<p>
 2. If you have not completed the
 <b>
  peer evaluation,
 </b>
 please do so ASAP. It is due Dec 14. We will use this form to help up finalize the grades.
</p>
<p>
 3. You should have received an evaluation form for this class.
 <b>
  I would appreciate it if you could fill out the form to provide feedback for this class.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 If you have any remaining questions about this course, please feel free to contact us.
</p>
<p>
 I hope your finals go well and have a great winter break.
</p>

  There was a previous post that said we had until approximately December 20th to take anything we wanted to keep out of Rhodes 129. This says that it needed to be taken by yesterday; has everything already been cleaned out, or do I have a chance to get my hardware kit if I take it today from 129?
