  Thanks to everyone for a great demo session on Tuesday. Just a final reminder to wrap up the semester.

 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. If you have not completed the

  There was a previous post that said we had until approximately December 20th to take anything we wanted to keep out of Rhodes 129. This says that it needed to be taken by yesterday; has everything already been cleaned out, or do I have a chance to get my hardware kit if I take it today from 129?
