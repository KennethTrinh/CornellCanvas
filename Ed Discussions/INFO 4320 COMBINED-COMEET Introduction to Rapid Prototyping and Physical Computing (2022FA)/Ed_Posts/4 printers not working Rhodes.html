  Thank you for reporting the issues.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some of the notes may come from 11/21, since when some of the printers have been fixed.
 </p>
 <p>
  We will have the maintenance team take a look at them tomorrow morning.

  It seems like 5 are down now. One of the other printers are not accepting the filament.

    A 7th one is appearing to be messing somebody's design up. I know it was having issues before.

      We put signs "not working " signs on 11/21.  The maintenance team fixed most of them on Tuesday (11/22).  But I don't know whether the sign was removed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Feel free to give them a try if they are not visually broken or not functioning.
     </p>
     <p>
      I will take another look tomorrow and also send the maintenance team there.
     </p>
