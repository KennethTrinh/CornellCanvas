 Hi!
</p>
<p>
 I had to leave the lecture early today so unfortunately I missed the brainstorming and group forming activities. I am a Junior in Info Sci looking for a group to join.
</p>
<p>
 I am not set on a certain type of project, but things that sound interesting to me are:
</p>
<p>
 1) A portable/pocket-sized piano keyboard with midi/headphone plug-in. Any similar music projects would also be interesting to me.
</p>
<p>
 2) Any of the ideas that involve a robot throwing a ping pong ball or any other object.
</p>
<p>
 It was difficult to read some of the sticky notes just from the picture so I don't know what all the other ideas are. But if you are looking for a second or third member feel free to reach out at sm2388@cornell.edu. I have a good amount of programming experience.
</p>
