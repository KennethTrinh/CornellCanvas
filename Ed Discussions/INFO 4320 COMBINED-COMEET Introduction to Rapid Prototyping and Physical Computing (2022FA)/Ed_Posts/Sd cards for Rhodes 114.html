 Could we get some SD cards and microSD-to-SD adapters for rhodes 114? Without them there are only a couple printers that are usable. Thanks!

  Thanks for letting us know. We actually purchased a couple of them before. Many were probably missing at this moment. I will ask TAs to help find them or purchase new ones.
