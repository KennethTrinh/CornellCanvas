 We will continue helping you to form a team and find a project idea this Wed.
</p>
<p>
 1.
 <b>
  If you have found a team and identified a project,
 </b>
 we can discuss with you and provide early feedback on your ideas.
</p>
<p>
 2.
 <b>
  If you have not found a team by Wed,
 </b>
 we will help you to find teams and project ideas.
</p>
<p>
 If you do not know how to implement a project at this moment, that is fine.  Don't worry about it. We will work with you to identify a feasible plan.
</p>
<p>
 If you have any questions, feel free to email me or any of the TAs.
