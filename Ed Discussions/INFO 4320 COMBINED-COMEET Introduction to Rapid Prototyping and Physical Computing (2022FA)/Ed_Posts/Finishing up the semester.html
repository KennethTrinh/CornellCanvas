 Hi all,
</p>
<p>
 Thank you for all your participation in the demo session. It is truly amazing to see so many wonderful projects! Now that you are mostly done with the course, there are a few more things to do before the end of the semester.
</p>
<p>
 1. Videos and pictures of your
 <b>
  design project 3
 </b>
 is due
 <b>
  Fri, Dec. 9
 </b>
 . Please remember to print out your design, assemble them and submit videos and pictures.
</p>
<p>
 2.
 <b>
  Optional additional materials
 </b>

 <b>
  Fri, Dec. 9
 </b>
 . You can use it to submit any material that you think is helpful to better represent your team project.
</p>
<p>
 3.
 <b>

 </b>

 <b>

 </b>
 . Please upload a screenshot of the end of form to finish the assignment.
 <b>
  Your response will not be shared outside the teaching staff.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 4. You are free to keep your team project prototypes. You put a lot of effort and money in them after all. If you need a place to temporarily keep them, you can put them in
 <b>
  Rhodes 129
 </b>
 until the
 <b>
  end of the semester (around Dec. 20)
 </b>
 . After that, we will consider any hardware that are still in Rhodes 114 and 129 not wanted and they will be
 <b>
  recycled for future semesters
 </b>
 .
 <b>
  This also applies to your
 </b>
 <b>
  personal hardware boxes.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 5. Please be responsible and
 <b>
  clean up the areas (tables, floors, etc.) that your team occupied
 </b>
 . We also kindly ask you to help
 <b>
  clean up the public spaces
 </b>
 in Rhodes 114 and 129. Your help is very much appreciated.
</p>
<p>
 Thank you again for your support for this course and hope you have a great winter break!
</p>
