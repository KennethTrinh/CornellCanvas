 Hi folks,
</p>
<p>
 I was thinking of offering some
 <b>
  extra office hours tomorrow from 2 PM-3ish
 </b>
 (maybe longer depending on demand) specifically to review concepts/methods that might be pertinent to tomorrow's prelim.
</p>
<p>
 You can select, or write down, which topics you'd like to review in this Google form
 <a href="https://forms.gle/ythjGAbhBYKzA1Af6">
  here
 </a>
 . I'll pick what we discuss tomorrow based on that, since time will likely be limited.
</p>
