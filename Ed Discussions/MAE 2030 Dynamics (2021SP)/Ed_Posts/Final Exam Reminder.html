 Hi Everybody,

<p>
 Just a few reminders about the final:
</p>
<list style="bullet">
 <li>
  <p>
   The final will be on Wednesday 5/19 at 7:30 p.m (until 10)
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   The exam is 2 hours and Thirty minutes,
   <b>
    and there is no extra time
   </b>
   as we have done on the prelims (SDS accommodations still apply)
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   The exam rooms are the same as prelim 3,
   <b>
    <underline>
     but your assignment may have changed!
    </underline>
   </b>
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   There will be five problems that are slightly shorter than prelim problems
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   The exam is cumulative and there are no formula sheets
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   The final problems are
   <b>
    graded out of 30 (instead of 25)
   </b>
   , to encourage those who have done well to still work hard on the final.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Study, breath deep and you got this!
  </p>
 </li>
</list>
