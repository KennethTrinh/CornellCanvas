  It depends on your calculator's settings for trigonometric functions. For example in matlab, sin() takes in radians and sind() takes in degrees. In terms of this week's homework problem 6, if you are calculating $sin(ct)$ using the units specified in the textbook, then you should use radians since the unit $s^{-1} \times s = 1$. If you want to use sind() then you need to convert $ct$ to be in degrees first.

  There are two pretty firm answers to the question about using degrees or radians:

 <list style="number">

   <paragraph>
    It doesn't matter.  Just make sure your computer or calculator knows what you are talking about; and
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    It matters.  Always use radians.
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
 </list>
 <paragraph>
  The second answer is relevant if you are doing anything analytical, with say, calculus.  If you use degrees, this basic formula is wrong:  $\frac{d}{dt}\sin t = \cos t$.   I recommend you stick with radians unless you have to communicate with someone using a physical instrument (to measure or build) that uses degrees.

  Also, skip the calculator and use Matlab so you get used to its power.  As Duan noted, Matlab, being designed for people who are theoretically inclined, uses radians.

  That's what I think.
