<callout type="info">
 What is your question?
</callout>
<p>
 It says the code should be able to solve all the equations from math 2930, so does that mean we have to do the code so that it can solve any nth order differential equation, or can we stick to second order?

 Describe the solution attempts you've made thus far.
