 So I have gone through the textbook studying normal modes. I have figured out how to consistently return matrices of eigenvectors and eigenvalues using matlab. I am not sure how to interpret this information into initial conditions for normal modes though. Can initial conditions only be found by intuition?

 I am aware of how to use eigenvalues to get frequency, but am not sure how to determine which eigenvalues correspond to which initial conditions if not determined by intuition.

  The list of numbers in an eigenvector is the list of initial positions, using all velocities = 0, that give a normal mode solution.  It's  a cosine wave in time.    Try it.

   Perfect, that confirms what I was suspecting. Thank you for the speedy reply!
