 I've done a few problems on practice problems that involve finding normal modes by inspection, rather than by finding them through eigenvalue and eigenvector calculations. I understand, in some cases, how to find the shape of the mode by using symmetry of the system. However, I'm still a little confused on how to find the frequency by introspection. I know that it is usually a multiple of root k/m, but am not sure how to find this multiple. Does it have something to do with the equivalent spring constant on each mass, or of the entire system?

  Finding an eigenvector $[v]$ of a matrix $[A]$ from eigenvalue $\lambda$ is a bit of a chore, you have to solve a set of equations.
 </p>
 <p>
  However finding an eigenvalue $\lambda$  from an eigenvector $[v]$ is trivial.

  </break>
 </p>
 <p>
  You know that $$[A][v] = \lambda [v]$$.
  <break>
  </break>
  And you know $[A]$,  and $[v]$.   So, just look at the first element of $[A][v]$ and compare it with the first element of $[v]$ and the ratio is $\lambda$ which is $\omega^2$ (Assuming $[A] = [M]^{-1} [K]$).
 </p>

  Another more physical, and less easy, method is to look at any one mass. Say, it's mass 3.  Look at the eigenvector's, say, 2d, 3rd and fourth elements, call them $v_2, v_3$ and $v_4$. Consider those as displacements.  Then calculate the net force  $F_3$ on mass 3 with those displacements (using the spring constant and the stretches you calculate).   Then calculate the 'effective' spring constant for mass three for that mode  $k_3^{eff} = F_3/v_3$.  Then the frequency of vibration of that mode is
 </p>
 <p>
  $$\omega
  <underline>
   = \sqrt{k_
  </underline>
  3^{eff}/m_3}$$.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  You will get the same answer no matter which mass you use.
