 You can make-up missed recitations.
</p>
<p>
 But, there is a strict limit of 12 people per section. So, you should check with the relevant TA to see if there is space.

<p>
 Make sure your attendence is recorded so that we have proper score for you at the end of the semester.

 You need not makeup recitation in the week that you missed.  But if you put off making up sections until the end of the semester you risk not finding a section that has space for you.
