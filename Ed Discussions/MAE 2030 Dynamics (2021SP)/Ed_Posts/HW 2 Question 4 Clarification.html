 Which problem are you working on? (ex. HW 1, Problem 3, 9.1.15)

<p>
 4 &amp; 4b
</p>
<callout type="info">
 What is your question?
</callout>
<p>
 I'm a little confused about the distinction between this question and lecture. Since we are asked to create the myEulerSolver that we did in class, with the same variable names, will our code be extremlely similar to that of in lecture, just more well-commented?
</p>
<p>
 Also, for 4b, we are asked to test the code with exponential growth. What would this differential equation/situation look like?
</p>
<p>
 Thanks!

  4a, yes this will probably be very similar to lecture code, but please make it clear commented and if asked be able to explain it to a friend/classmate/TA/Parent
 </p>
 <p>
  4b.  write an ODE that has  y=A*exp(bx) as a solution, this should be within your skillset

   Often you will find homework solutions, or near solutions,  here or there, in lecture, recitation, the book, or on the www.  At least a fraction of your homework is not meant as a puzzle or challenge. It is, instead, something that you should learn to do.  So, although you could, in this case, copy from lecture, and then add comments, you should instead learn to write the code, from beginning to end

     For 4b I am having trouble figuring out what my ICs are and therefore my diff eqs. I would think That A is changing by exp(bx) and that x changes by (bx) yet when I graph this I get a straight line. Not sure how else to think about this

      You want a differential equation that has an exponential solution, namely the first one above.  The simplest case would be $\dot x = x$ with $x(0) = 1$.  That has the solution  $x=e^t$.    You can then compare your Euler solution to the differential equation with that analytical solution.
