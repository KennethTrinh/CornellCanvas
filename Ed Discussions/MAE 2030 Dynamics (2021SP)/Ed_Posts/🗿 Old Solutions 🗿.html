 "Old Solutions" = solutions that have been written and collected from previous years. They are mostly unorganized and not guaranteed to be correct.
</p>
<p>
 As you know, near the end of each week, we publish new solutions that the current TAs and Professor Ruina have worked on. These should be referenced when studying or doing peer reviews.
</p>
<p>
 That said, you are always permitted to look at previous years' material if it helps you build confidence while working on the homework. (These materials actually have been available, but might have been hard to find. They weren't necessarily advertised.)

  In accordance with making things on Canvas a bit easier to find, we've put links to the

   Old Solutions folder
  </a>
  in a couple of new places:

<p>
 To reiterate,
 <b>
  these solutions have not been checked and are not complete
 </b>
 . The official solutions that we post at the end of the week will almost certainly be better (considering that we also have these old solutions to start with). But you are welcome to browse around in the Old Solutions folder if it helps you with your learning. Use them at your own discretion.
