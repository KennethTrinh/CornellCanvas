  One small lecture clarification.  Someone asked if we could just get $\ddot \phi$ by differentiating our expression for  $$\dot \phi = \frac{\dot \theta r \cos\theta}{D}.$$

  The answer is, as I said, `yes'.  But, I note now, this is not so simple as it looks because $D= D(\theta)$, which is a complicated expression.  So, this differentiation  would involve more algebra and would not be, I don't think, any easier than the vector method I showed.  Rather, probably harder and more error prone.
