 In class today (Friday Feb 19, 2021) I showed some elaborations with Euler's method:
</p>
<list style="bullet">
 <li>
  <p>
   Putting ODE solver in a separate file, called ODE1 (that name means 'ODE solver that is first order', next week I'll show you how to write ODE2)
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Using  Matlabs 'anonomous functions' to pass parameters.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Specifying a time interval rather than all of the intermediate times.
  </p>
 </li>
</list>
<p>
 I also described how to make ODE1  generate a desired accuracy, but didn't write the code for you.
</p>
<p>
 Below is the code I did write in class plus what I described but didn't write in class.  And, I added some comments.   I also added another feature which is to specify the maximum time (when Matlab should give up).

 As usual, you should learn to write this code yourself (or improve on it, I am not a sophisticated programmer). To start, you can learn what I have done. There's probably various things for you to think about there, as well as some Matlab things you should know (e.g., tic, toc, num2str, break, if, etc).

 Nothing new in this code is needed for the homework due  Saturday Feb 20. You can wait to study it until you have done the HW.
