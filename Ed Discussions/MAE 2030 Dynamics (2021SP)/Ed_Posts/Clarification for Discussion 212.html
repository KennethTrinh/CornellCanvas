  In my aside on natural frequencies and how they relate to normal modes, I had mentioned that for certain kinds of vibrations in solids, $\omega \propto \sqrt{E/\rho}$. This is true, but there's also a geometric factor with 1/length units that needs to multiply $\sqrt{E/\rho}$ in order to get something with frequency units. (It usually turns out to be some characteristic length of the solid, but not always.)

  A small expansion and probably confusification,   For a given shape and size of a homogeneous linear elastic material the normal-mode frequencies are proportional to $\sqrt{E/\rho}$.  If the shape is constant and but the overall size $L$ is varying then the frequencies are proportional to $\sqrt{E/\rho}/L$. If the shape is also changing then everything is more complicated.

  For example, if one is considering vibrating beams, and only modes of vibration for which the beam approximations are reasonably accurate, then the frequencies are proportional to $\sqrt{E/\rho}/L^*$, where $L^*$ has dimensions of length but is not such  a simple quantity:

  $$L^* = L^3/\sqrt{I}$$

  where $I$ is the area moment of inertia of the cross section.
