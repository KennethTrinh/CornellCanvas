 Which problem are you working on? (ex. HW 1, Problem 3, 9.1.15)
</callout>
<p>
 HW2 problem 5, 6 and 7
</p>
<callout type="info">
 What is your question?
</callout>
<p>
 On canvas it says that HW2 has no separate pdf file.
</p>
<callout type="info">
 Describe the solution attempts you've made thus far.
</callout>
<p>
 I wrote all solutions to problem 5, 6 and 7 in matlab and thus I don't have a FBD for those problems. Is that a issue?

   Course rule:
  </b>
  If you use any mechanics equation (F= ma, LMB, AMB) it is necessarily associated with a Free Body Diagram and you have to draw it.

  I believe what they mean by 'no separate pdf file' is that the assignment has not separate pdf that has questions on it
