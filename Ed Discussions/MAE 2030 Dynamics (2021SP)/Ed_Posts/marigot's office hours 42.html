  ***********

 <paragraph>
  I am bedridden from the vaccine &amp; other ‚ú®ailments‚ú®
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Also, my 7-10pm office hours attendance was super low last week. Seems I should adjust my hours going forward.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For tonight, I'll do the first of my 3 hours (7-8pm) in case people have dying Friday-night questions.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I'll hold more office hours tomorrow during one of the gaps. 3-5pm or 9-11pm. Comment down below if you have a strong preference. Also comment down below if you'd like Sunday office hours in the future.
