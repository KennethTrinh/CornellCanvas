 Could anyone clarify why you multiply by g in the below example form HW3 q11a. It makes sense from a units perspective but I'm not exactly sure why beyond that (i thought lbf and lbm were 1:1).

  I have a reasonably detailed essay about all of this in my book in a section called "Units".  It starts on page 222 (pdf page 226). I recommend that you read this  somewhat careully.

   It's a weird thing, but the units are programmed so that a 1 lbm object has a 1lbf weight on Earth.
  </p>
  <p>
   In metric we have 1 kg m/s^2 = 1 N, but we do not have 1 lbm ft/s^2 = 1 lbf. There is actually a conversion factor between lbm ft/s^2 and lbf, and that factor is g (32.2ft/s^2). We say that 32.2 lbm ft/s^2 = 1 lbf so that the 1 lbm object has a 1 lbf weight on Earth.
  </p>
  <p>
   So, 1 lbm * g / 1 lbf is equal to 1, which is why it is used as a conversion factor here.
