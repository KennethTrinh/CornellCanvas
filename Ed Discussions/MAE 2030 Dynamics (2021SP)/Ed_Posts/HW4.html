  As I said in class today (Friday Feb 26), we will have HW due next Saturday.

  If the exam gets cancelled for some reason, we will still have HW due Saturday. There is no "if" involved.

  In my mind, the primary studying for the exam is doing homework and so on (reading, thinking, discussing) in the period of time leading to the exam. The exam itself should not be taking too many hours from your week.  I hope.  Or, if it does, I guess those hours are paying off a debt from previous weeks.  Or, you are choosing to work/prepare  more than I would have you do.

  The exam might include material testing your understanding the lectures up to the time of the exam.
