 I was trying to access the Pratap MATLAB book on canvas per suggestion of the other post here to brush up on MATLAB but it seems the link is broken? When I click on it just just shows:

 Unsure if something is wrong on my end or on the canvas site :/

  Thanks for finding this error, I believe the course page was copied and the underlying file was not.  It should be fixed now!
