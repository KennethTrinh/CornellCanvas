 Which problem are you working on? (ex. HW 1, Problem 3, 9.1.15)

 What is your question?

 The function euler_3fns_b.m from lecture seems quite complete, so I'm wondering how I should do the assignment given that I've basically been given access to the solution. This feels wrong in a couple ways: I feel like I'm breaching academic integrity, and I have no opportunity to practice what I've learned in lecture. Can someone point out any differences between this problem and the one solved by euler_3fns_b.m (other than that I need to test it in 4b)?

 Describe the solution attempts you've made thus far.

 I feel like I can't attempt something that requires no effort.

  Your goal  is not to get the solution onto a piece of paper, but to develop the capacity to do that without any help.  Sometimes the answers to homework questions will be directly accessible to you from lecture, from recitation, from solutions posted online, from a friend, from a TA in office hours or from Chegg.  Use those in a way that most facilitates your education, that is, your goal to be self-sufficient.

  Different people approach that goal different ways. Some like to struggle, treating each problem like a puzzle. And some want to be shown exactly how to do something and then practice it, again and again,n with progressively less help.

  As for academic integrity, please read the course policies about that in the various Canvas pages. Basically, we have defined cheating away.  The expression "If you cheat, you are only cheating yourself." applies literally in this course.

  So, what should you do?  Do the problem by yourself without looking at the lecture example, or your notes or anything else.  If you get stuck, then look at your notes or whatever. Then when you are done, do it again, without any help.  If you look something up, then .... do it again!   That's not cheating, it's learning!
  <break>
  </break>

  </break>
  Now, if even that independent approach takes "no effort" then challenge yourself in some manner.   Pose a question that extends what is asked for, and answer it.
