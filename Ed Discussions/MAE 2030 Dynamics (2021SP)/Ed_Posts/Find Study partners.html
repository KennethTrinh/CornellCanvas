 Working with other students is a great idea.  We are going to facilitate that as well as we can.

 The university has other systems.  I have been given this paragraph to post by  Cornell's Learning Strategies Center.  Note,  that according to our course rules, it is essentially impossible to be guilty of academic integrity violations on homework, even if you try.  That is,  on homework you are encouraged to get any and all help from any place you can, including other students.

 And, FYI, if one student helps another, it is often the helper who gains most from the interaction.

  Studying with peers is a great way to connect with other Cornell students and is a powerful tool for learning. Finding people to study with can be challenging (even when you are taking in-person classes), and Cornell’s Learning Strategies Center (
  <a href="http://lsc.cornell.edu/">
   LSC
   ) helps match you with study partners. To find out more about study groups and partners, and to sign-up for study partners for class you are in, visit the LSC’s
