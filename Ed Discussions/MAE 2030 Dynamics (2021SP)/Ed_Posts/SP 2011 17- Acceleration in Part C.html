  In the solution, when doing the angular momentum balance about point a in part c, the key reads off
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  \vec{0}=\vec{r_{BA}}\times m\vec{a_B}
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  And makes the following substitution
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  \vec{a_B}=\vec{a_A}+\vec{a_{BA}}
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  Where the key then just uses the centripetal acceleration about a for the first term, and then just the formula for acceleration in polar coordinates for the second term.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>

  I ended up using the 5-term acceleration formula we've been using in class and got the same thing, and I was wondering why I got the same thing, and why the method used in the answer key works for this specific problem. It seemed pretty similar to the problem we did in lecture on 4/30. where we explicitly used the 5-term acceleration formula.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  So, in essence, my question is, for this setup:

 </figure>
 <paragraph>
  Why can we just do the three terms for the acceleration of point b here without doing the 5 term acceleration formula. Once we dot through by er it all becomes the same thing, but I'm wondering why this is valid, and if my approach to use the 5-term acceleration form is also valid.

  Without following the details of your comment, there is this:  All of this sort of problem can be done multiple ways using one or another moving frame or using polar coordinates  or using relative or absolute angles. In each approach you get the same final answer, but the individual terms are different.

  Check your answer by two different methods. If they disagree, you have a mistake in at least one of the methods.
