 On Monday, a couple of you guys got all the way to sketching a graph of x2 vs x1. And I said something wrong about the shape! Who knows what the mistake was? (Comment below)

  You said it was a pretty shaped ellipse I think... is it not pretty or not an ellipse by chance...

   That is correct! I said it was a cute ellipse, but it is not an ellipse. Follow-up question: what are the conditions that

    would
   </i>
   make two sinusoidal signals form an ellipse when plotted against each other?
