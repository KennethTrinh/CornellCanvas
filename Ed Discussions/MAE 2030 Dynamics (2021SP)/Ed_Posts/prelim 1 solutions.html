 I was reviewing the solutions for problem 3 on prelim 1 and I had a question about the initial slope of the graph of a vs t in part b. The slope in the solutions was -gm/c but when I took the derivative of a(t) at t=0, I got -cg/m. Could someone please explain why the slope would be -gm/c? Thank you!
