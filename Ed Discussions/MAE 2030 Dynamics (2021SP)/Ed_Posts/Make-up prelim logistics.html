  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I have heard that there may be a make-up prelim on May 14th for students who have missed any prelim for any reason. Would it be possible to provide more information about this make-up prelim, (exact time and location) so that students who want to take it can be certain not to miss it?

  Thank you!

  Anyone who needs to take a makeup will take it on Saturday May 15th. It will be in-person if you were supposed to take the missed exam in-person, and on Zoom if missed exam was going to be on Zoom.

  If you have to miss an exam and need to take a makeup, email me.

  We will find a room and time soon.
