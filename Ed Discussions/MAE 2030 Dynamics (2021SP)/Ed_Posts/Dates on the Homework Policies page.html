 I found these confusing dates on the Homework Policies page on Canvas:
</p>
<blockquote>
 To get you right into the swing of things, there is HW due Monday January 28 by midnight. It is associated with the fictitious lecture on Monday Jan 21.
</blockquote>
<p>
 January 21 and 28 are Sundaysâ€”should they be corrected to the 22nd and 29th? I'm also wondering why the sooner lecture is "fictitious." Can someone clarify that?
</p>

   Is one of the homework pages disabled? I remember reading about how to properly head my pages but now that page has been made unavailable.

    That was also old (based on turning it in in-person), everything you need should be here:
