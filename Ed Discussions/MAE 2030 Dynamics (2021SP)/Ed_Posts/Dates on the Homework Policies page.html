  I found these confusing dates on the Homework Policies page on Canvas:
 </paragraph>
 <blockquote>
  To get you right into the swing of things, there is HW due Monday January 28 by midnight. It is associated with the fictitious lecture on Monday Jan 21.
 </blockquote>
 <paragraph>
  January 21 and 28 are Sundaysâ€”should they be corrected to the 22nd and 29th? I'm also wondering why the sooner lecture is "fictitious." Can someone clarify that?

  Is one of the homework pages disabled? I remember reading about how to properly head my pages but now that page has been made unavailable.
