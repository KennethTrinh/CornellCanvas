  Just a quick reminder -- the rubric filled out by Peer Reviewers does not determine the actual grade of the Homework Assignment. The Grader does. If you make mistakes filling out the rubric or you feel that someone gave you low marks, don't worry about it. Your focus should be on providing good feedback as a Peer and looking over the feedback you get from your Peers.
