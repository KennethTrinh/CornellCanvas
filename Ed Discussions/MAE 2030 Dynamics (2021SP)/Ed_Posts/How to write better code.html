 As you have hopefully figured out, there is going to be a fair amount of matlab in this course (almost every week).  Debugging your own code is an important skill to learn.  Furthermore it is also important to write your code clearly so others can help you debug.  Here are things that you should do to make your code more readable.  The TA's will tell you to do these things in office hours.
</p>
<list style="number">
 <li>
  <p>
   Do not do too much on one line, this error is super common.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Comments- just do it, and clearly, it makes it easier for everyone
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Use functions and define their inputs and outputs
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Name variables sensibly.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Know what you are trying to do on every line and what the expected result is
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   To debug, print vars or use the debugger tool in MatLab
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Consider breaking code up into multiple functions or scripts
  </p>
 </li>
</list>
<p>
 These things will probably take you an extra 20% more time writing the code but it will allow you to debug twice as fast!
