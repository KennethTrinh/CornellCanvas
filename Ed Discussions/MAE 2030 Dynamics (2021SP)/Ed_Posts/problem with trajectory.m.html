  In this code from lecture, we use isnumeric(soln.xe) to test whether or not soln.xe is an empty array bc if it is, that means the event wasn't reached within the tspan. I was trying this out, however, and it seems like isnumeric() returns true for the empty vector [] actually, so I kept getting errors. Should we be using ~isempty()?

  Thanks.

  You are exactly correct.  My code is wrong, yours is right.

  I did not adequately check my bad code.

 <pre>Summariing, line  38 of my file trajectory.m  from lecture on March 12 now  incorrectly reads:

if isnumeric(soln.xe); % If event is not reached, soln.xe = [] which is not numeric

That line should be changed to

i<code>f ~isempty(soln.xe); % If event is not reached, soln.xe = [] which is empty</code>

</pre>
