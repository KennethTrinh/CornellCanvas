  Which problem are you working on? (ex. HW 1, Problem 3, 9.1.15)
 </callout>
 <paragraph>
  HW 1, Problem 1 (Spring and Mass)
 </paragraph>
 <callout type="info">
  What is your question?
 </callout>
 <paragraph>
  Does the spring's "rest length" L_0 refer to:
 </paragraph>
 <list style="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    The length of the spring when completely unstretched (no mass on it)?
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    The length of the spring when the mass is hanging at equilibrium?
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
 </list>
 <callout type="info">
  Describe the solution attempts you've made thus far.
 </callout>
 <paragraph>
  I've drawn a picture and an FBD, but I want to make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly before I continue.

  It refers to the length of the spring when completely unstretched, which is when no forces are applied.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Bonus: it doesn't really matter in this case. You can figure this out if you have extra time and are interested.

  A spring's rest length $L_0$ is it's length when the tension is zero. If $L$ is the present length, then $L_0$ is the length that makes this equations true
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  $$ T = k(L - L_0)$$
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The "equilibrium length" is the length of the spring when the whole system is in static equilibrium.  For this problem with a hanging weight that would be
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  $$L_e = L_0 + mg/k$$
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The purpose of this homework is to get you thinking about those things so that you are taking a step from
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  $$\ddot x + x = f$$
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  towards dealing with real systems.

  Read about springs in Section 7.1 of the textbook.
