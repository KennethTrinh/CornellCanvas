 Which problem are you working on? (ex. HW 1, Problem 3, 9.1.15)
</callout>
<p>
 HW 1, Problem 1 (Spring and Mass)
</p>
<callout type="info">
 What is your question?
</callout>
<p>
 Does the spring's "rest length" L_0 refer to:
</p>
<list style="bullet">
 <li>
  <p>
   The length of the spring when completely unstretched (no mass on it)?
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   The length of the spring when the mass is hanging at equilibrium?
  </p>
 </li>
</list>
<callout type="info">
 Describe the solution attempts you've made thus far.
</callout>
<p>
 I've drawn a picture and an FBD, but I want to make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly before I continue.

  A spring's rest length $L_0$ is it's length when the tension is zero. If $L$ is the present length, then $L_0$ is the length that makes this equations true
 </p>
 <p>
  $$ T = k(L - L_0)$$
 </p>
 <p>
  The "equilibrium length" is the length of the spring when the whole system is in static equilibrium.  For this problem with a hanging weight that would be
 </p>
 <p>
  $$L_e = L_0 + mg/k$$
 </p>
 <p>
  The purpose of this homework is to get you thinking about those things so that you are taking a step from
 </p>
 <p>
  $$\ddot x + x = f$$
 </p>
 <p>
  towards dealing with real systems.

  Read about springs in Section 7.1 of the textbook.

   It refers to the length of the spring when completely unstretched, which is when no forces are applied.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bonus: it doesn't really matter in this case. You can figure this out if you have extra time and are interested.
