  A few weeks ago I posted note  #73. talking about improving the way you write your code to help you spend less time debugging.   If you have not read that note please go back and read it-I think it will be helpful.  Here are some tips and tricks about how to debug in matlab.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  By simply removing a semicolon matlab will print out the result of that line
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Check individual variables in the console to ensure clarity
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  run all functions with test cases (particularly right-hand side functions).  You don't have to write formal test cases but you need to make sure functions work before calling them in a loop (or in an Euler solver).
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Matlab does a bad job of telling you precisely where the error is.  It tells you where the code failed but frequently not where the problem originates.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  common matlab errors are row vs column matrixes, the array indexing starting at one, and passing stuff in and out of fuctions.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Debugging is a skill, and one of the key outcomes of this class.  Going forward in office hours the TAs will be more hands-off in debugging and will put you into breakout rooms to peer debug.
