  In part b, how do you know that Vd=0? The rest of the problem makes sense, but I'm not sure how the answer key concluded that.

  If D is the contact point between the film and the inner spool radius (I can't tell too well if that's a D in the diagram), I would assume the $V_D = 0$ is coming from assuming the inner spool is rolling without slipping "on" the film.

  Expanding a bit:  not sliding means D has no velocity component along the slope.  Not penetrating nor leaving means it has no velocity component along the slope.
