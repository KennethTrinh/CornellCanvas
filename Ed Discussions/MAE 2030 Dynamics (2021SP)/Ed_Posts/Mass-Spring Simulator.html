 Hi folks,
</p>
<p>
 I whipped up a MATLAB Live Script that lets you simulate the behavior of the mass-spring system described in Problem 11.3.8 of the textbook. Feel free to use it to get familiar with the idea of normal modes, or just to play around with it however you like. (The activities listed at the end are just suggestions, you don't need to do anything. This is just for you to play around with.)
</p>
<p>
 If you have any questions about it, feel free to let me know. Hope it's helpful!
