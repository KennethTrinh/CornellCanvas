 Which problem are you working on? (ex. HW 1, Problem 3, 9.1.15)
</callout>
<p>
 HW 3, question 8
</p>
<callout type="info">
 What is your question?
</callout>
<p>
 What's the best way (or a starting point) to calculate a number of intervals given relTol?
</p>
<callout type="info">
 Describe the solution attempts you've made thus far.
</callout>
<p>
 I've looked up the formula for the error in the midpoint method, and it depends on the maximum value of the second derivative of the function on the time interval. The problem is, don't you have to go through with the approximation in order to find ẍ?
</p>
<p>
 Does this mean the process would have to be iterative, first starting with an arbitrary number of intervals? I worry that running through the loop twice or three times would decrease this method's efficiency.

  The way to compute relTol has already been implemented in the code posted last Friday. Go to canvas/modules/Matlab Examples From Lecture/Euler_and_more.zip.

  I think you can use that code directly. Please correct me if I am wrong.

   I wouldn't say that what I posted was "correct". Rather, it is just one way to estimate the error.  The method I used is iterative, so yes, it does cut into the efficiency.

   There are fancier methods. I just want you to have a sense that you can compare a solution at two different step sizes to estimate the error.  This idea works for any method.

   The method Isaac read about, using the second derivative, is fancier, more accurate, and less general.  There is a whole science of such things.

   I am just aiming for you to understand the idea at the lowest possible level (which is about my level, by the way).
