 Students,
</p>
<p>
 What are your thoughts on zoom vs in person for office hours now that you have been through a week of class.    The majority of OH will almost certainly be online for the remainder of the semester but I wanted to get people's thoughts.  Also worth noting that at present we do not have a way to do in-person OH so for now this is totally hypothetical.
</p>
<p>
 1. Would you attend in person OH (convience covid etc)?
</p>
<p>
 2. What are benifits and drawbacks of zoom OH?
</p>
<p>
 3. Ways to improve the office hours schedule?

  There are dedicated rooms for properly socially distanced in-person office hours.  We can have access to those. In person office hours would probably work like this:

  A TA would stand at a black- or white-board and students would ask about this or that.  Q and A. With social distancing it could not be that a TA is guiding you with your work, looking at your paper.

  I have heard the Professor Ritz did this in MAE 2020 last semester and students liked it.  We are open to the idea.
