  What are your thoughts on zoom vs in person for office hours now that you have been through a week of class.    The majority of OH will almost certainly be online for the remainder of the semester but I wanted to get people's thoughts.  Also worth noting that at present we do not have a way to do in-person OH so for now this is totally hypothetical.

  3. Ways to improve the office hours schedule?

  I have heard the Professor Ritz did this in MAE 2020 last semester and students liked it.  We are open to the idea.
