 Do we need to use MATLAB at all if a question doesn't ask for it?

  First, why Matlab vs Python or Julia or Fortran or Visual  Basic or C++ or Java? We are using Matlab, and only Matlab, to make it so we can help people, so they can help each other, and so we can grade.  Also, Matlab is well suited for our uses.

  Next, ideally, the computer should become to you now as a calculator was in high school.  There are things you can do with a computer.  You should know what those things are. And you should use the computer when it is needed or helpful.   If a problem doesn't mention Matlab it still could be that you can't solve the problem without Matlab.

  If you can do everything asked without Matlab. And Matlab is not explicitly asked for, then you should do the problem the best you can by whatever means.

  Example:  "Solve an ODE with Euler's method and compare with the analytic solution."  It would be tortuously tedious to do this well without a computer, and in this class that means Matlab.

  Example: Car friction problem.  One could do a fine job of that without using a computer at all.
