  The first point says our code should be inside the pdf file, and the second one says we also need to include a .m matlab file. Do we submit our code in one way or both?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Also I'm not sure what a README file is. Is it the one that we use on ed here in the tool bar?

  A  README file is a file named, appropriately, "README".  It could be plain text or pdf.  It has text in it that tells the reader what is in the other files in the directory.  It's like a table of contents, or index, for a collection of files in a folder. When a reader opens a folder the first thing they do, or should do, is read the README file.

  The most clear thing is to have your pdf be complete in itself, with no need for a reader to look at anything else.  Thus it should include, if nothing else, at least as an appendix ,any code you wrote and used.  But, you should also be handing in functioning matlab code so your peer graders or real grader can try it and see how it works.

  Is it ok to screenshot my matlab code and put it on my hw pdf? Since I'm handwritting all other works on a paper, it is hard to directly paste the code to a scanned page.

  Do we need to submit a "readme" file if our code is well commented and the pdf contains written work/copy of the code?

  It'll be a little redundant, but go ahead and make one anyway in order to get into the habit. Later you will be submitting homeworks with many files, so it's a good habit to buildðŸ¥¦
