 I noticed that all of the Prelim 1 practice exams posted on Canvas and Ed Discussion appear to be the answer keys. Are there versions of these files that don't have the answers?

  You can pretty much simulate that by just not looking at things written by hand (with the exception of any figures drawn with the problem statement).
