 We need 24  more volunteers to take the exam online, as per #177, #112, and #167.

 We cannot get another room.

 If we do not get the volunteers by 12:30 today, then people will get assigned randomly to Schwartz Auditorium in the Performing Arts building.  We will not then accept requests to take the exam online (too much chaos).

 Go
 <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rwE4uDeawcs1WOekGV8CAYjiGjhV6zMQHOPGDfHCCUQ/edit">
  here
 </a>
 to sign up.

 For those who have signed up, the biggest issues I have seen when looking at camera setups are:
</p>
<list style="bullet">
 <li>
  <p>
   Camera not far enough away to show all things in easy arms reach,  I think about 5 feet is optimal, and 3 feet only marginal.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Too much clutter on desk.  You need to make it so that it is obvious that you have no cheat sheets or phones easily accissible to you.
   <break>
   </break>
   <break>
   </break>
  </p>
 </li>
</list>

  Since the doc closed at 12:30 and the required 62 was not reached, are the people who signed up to take it online still taking it online?

   Will you be holding office hours today to check setups?
