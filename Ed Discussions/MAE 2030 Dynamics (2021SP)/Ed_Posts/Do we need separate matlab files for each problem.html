<p>
 Do we need separate matlab files for each problem?
</p>
<callout type="info">
 Describe the solution attempts you've made thus far.

 Since we are running different ODEs and IC for each test (harmonic oscillator/exponential growth). Do we need to make different matlab files so that each file only solves an ODE for one problem? Or when we change the ODEs and ICs, we screenshot them and put them into a pdf file to submit?

  If the change between problems is as simple as changing parameters, no need to include a MATLAB file for each case (assuming that the changes for each case and the corresponding results are presented and discussed clearly).

   As a rule, problems should be distinct so that they can be read independently.
   <break>
   </break>
   But if you have a file for, say, myEulerSolver.m, you need not copy that file again and again.  Somehow, however, anyone should be able to read and understand a single problem on its own.

   Imagine another student trying to learn just one problem by looking at your homework. You don't want to make that a puzzle or a complex operation.
