  I'm still relatively new to Matlab, so it's a bit difficult for me to fully understand what exactly is going on in lecture in terms of Matlab. I understand the mathematics behind the ODE solver built in class, but the implementation of code that I came up with to solve the problem on my own looks a bit different the suggested form in the Canvas prompt. Is this okay, or should I be calling my function in the exact way indicated, using the same terms?

  Also, in another Ed Discussion post, Professor Ruina said that the function just needs to work for an arbitrary number of
  <italic>
   first order
  </italic>
  ODEs. Can we restrict our code to just deal with first order systems of of ODE inputs, or should we be also considering inputs of higher order ODEs that can be reduced to a system of linear first order ODEs?

  Your code doesn't need to include the exact terms included in the example code. There's flexibility as long as your code works.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  You should consider inputs of higher order ODEs that can be reduced to n first-order ODEs in the myEulerSolver function.

  Actually, the terms I chose were not random, and it would be best if you followed the prompt exactly.  The reason is that we are building up to an understanding of Matlab's ODE45 and I am mimicking some of the features of that program.
