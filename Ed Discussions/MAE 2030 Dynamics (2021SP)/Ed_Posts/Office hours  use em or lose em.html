 Check there often to see if there are any changes.

 My (Andy) office hours are separate because they are not just for this course, but for other people who want to talk with me (people doing projects, advisees, etc).  Mine are listed on my home page. They are at my zoom

 If there are changes, which there will be, I will try to post those on my www page.

 "Use em or lose em"?  Are we thinking of canceling them if people don't show up?  No, it's really "Use them or lose the benefit of them."   We, the TAs and me too, want to help you. There is nothing nicer than helping a student sort something out.

 Also note: the office hours Zoom room is always open, so you can go there and hope another classmate shows up and you can work together.

 Finally:  I have office hours today, Monday, Feb 15, 2021, from 3:30 - 5:30. It would be great to see a few of you
