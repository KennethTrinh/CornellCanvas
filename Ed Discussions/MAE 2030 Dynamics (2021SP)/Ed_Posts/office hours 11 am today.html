  There should be office hours today.

  I think possibly against regulations, I will have my office hours on Friday and Monday.  I told the TAs that these (Fri, Sat, Sun, Mon) are their wellness days also, so they need not have scheduled office hours.  But some of them might have office hours anyway.

  And certainly you  can post questions on here, on Ed Discussion.

  I am sooo sorry! I was in a meeting and forgot to update the calendar. I now added an office hour from 3-4 today.
