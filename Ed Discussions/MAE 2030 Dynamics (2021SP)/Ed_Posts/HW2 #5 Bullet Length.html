 Which problem are you working on? (ex. HW 1, Problem 3, 9.1.15)
</callout>
<p>
 Problem 5, 10.1.26
</p>
<callout type="info">
 What is your question?
</callout>
<p>
 Don't we need the length of the bullet in order to find numerical answers? Or should the answers be in terms of the length?
</p>
<callout type="info">
 Describe the solution attempts you've made thus far.
</callout>
<p>
 I tried rearranging the equations in a way that would solve for the length or eliminate it, but this doesn't appear to be possible since we only know the ratio of the densities, not the individual density values.

  Oh yes... good question. I think you need to use the density of water (not stated in the problem, but well-known to be 1000kg/m^3).

   Wait, if we know the density of water do we need to even find L? I was able to find x(t) without ever using L (at least I thought I did...)

    I think I also solved it without L. Now im wondering if it was a mistake to pull in outside numbers... let me think about it some more
