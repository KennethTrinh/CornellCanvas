  For the exponential equation we need to be able to solve (first question in Matlab) can we use just y = e^x or something more general form like y = A^(Bx) +C?

   I don't see it in Assignments or Modules &gt; Homework Assignments. It's not in Files &gt; HW Assignments, either.

   Perhaps it's not published or something?

     When I click on assignment 2 there is no file to download, all I can see is the grading criteria.

      Try this
      <a href="https://canvas.cornell.edu/courses/25081/pages/homework-assignments">
       link
      </a>
      â€”you should hopefully see the homework problems there if you scroll down enough. Hope this helps!
