 Which problem are you working on? (ex. HW 1, Problem 3, 9.1.15)
</callout>
<p>
 HW3 Problem 10 - 10.2.16
</p>
<callout type="info">
 What is your question?
</callout>
<p>
 How do we figure out vdot/graph speed over time? (part b)
</p>
<callout type="info">
 Describe the solution attempts you've made thus far.
</callout>
<p>
 I've done part a and I'm pretty sure it is correct, but, I'm struggling to actually set up part b. With whatever ODE I try to write I end up having to divide by zero which would suggest infinite acceleration (I'm guessing this is actually part of the answer for part d and e) which I can't manage to graph in MATLAB.... I imagine there is some simple solution for something I'm overcomplicating I just can't quite figure out what to do :/

  Yes you are correct that at v=0 there would be infinite force applied.  what is one small change to the initial conditions you could make so this problem doesn't make matlab mad?

   ok well its nice to know I'm atleast
   <i>
    somewhat
   </i>
   on the right track.
   <break>

   I thought that maybe I could put some very small value for v_0 but the graph I get out doesn't make much sense... so either something is wrong with my code (which I don't think is the case because it was working last week with other ODEs) or I messed up writing my differential equation.
   <break>
   </break>
   The latter I sorted by having net power equal to the constant power from the cyclist minus drag power and solving for vdot from there, but that didn't work as far as I can tell
  </p>
  <p>
   EDIT: I fixed it! not sure if this is what you were suggesting but, if I make both t0 and v0 some small non-zero value and I get a graph that actually makes sense; thanks! :)
  </p>
  <p>
   EDIT2: I think I only needed to have v0 be non-zero, I think that before my value for v0 was just too small and so with rounding error it became essentially zero. Thanks again!
