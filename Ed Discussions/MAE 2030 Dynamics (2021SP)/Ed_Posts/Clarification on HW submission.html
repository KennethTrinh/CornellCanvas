 Im a bit confused as to whether or not our HW is meant to be submitted as a single file. In previous ed discussion threads, somebody asked this question, and it seems like we are meant to just submit a single PDF with all of the files combined into 1. However, while doing my peer reviews, it seems like people were submitting a pdf and a .m file as well...? Should we have submitted just two distinct files then?

   As noted, if there is only one .m file, you don't need to put it in a folder and, assuming it is well commented at the top, you don't need a README file.

    Got it, thanks. Should I resubmit with separate .m code or is it too late for that now?
