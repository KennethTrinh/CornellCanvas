  There was a mistake in the last part (where it solves for the angular velocity) of the homework solution to P54 (17.1.12). A corrected version has been uploaded.

  There should be 4 possible cases instead of 2.

  For those who don't want to track this down, 17.1.12  is the problem concerning the Javelon.  The answer above, paying attention to 4 cases,  concerns a rather mathematical and precise answer to the stated problem. But such enumeration is not at the heart of anything you are supposed to be learning in this class.

  What's the issue?  Given the statement of the problem (less than one revolution, javelon tangent to path at landing), there are two ways that the front of the javelon could hit the ground (CW and CCW rotations) and two ways the back could hit the ground.

  </break>
  The actual intent was to consider  the front hitting  the ground with a CW rotation rate.  Thus only one of the four cases is really relevant.

  The thoroughness of the type that

  shows is fine, but not needed, central nor important for what you should be paying attention to. It does reflect careful,  literal reading of the problem statement, however! So it is not wrong, it is just, so to speak, tangential :).
