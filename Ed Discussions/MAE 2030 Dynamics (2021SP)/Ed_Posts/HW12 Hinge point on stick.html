  I think the problem statement describes a stick that's only rotating. It doesn't have to be hinged at any point, as long as there is a torque applied to it that keeps it spinning but it's COM is fixed in space. (So if it is hinged then the hinge point has to be the center.)

  I'm not sure that I understand, the problem statement only says the stick is rotating with a constant angular speed, from my understanding, it does not forbid the stick to be hinged at points other than its CoM.

  I mean, even if the hinge is not at the CoM it can still rotate at constant omega, right?

  True, what forbids the hinge at other points is my assumption that CoM of rod stays fixed, but I guess you don't necessarily have to do that to be able to do the problem. I think you can solve the problem however you like as long as your assumptions are made clear.

  The problem really is, the right side of the angular momentum balance equation depends on where the hinge is, if it is not at the CoM of the stick, one of the terms on the right will not go to zero, so I think a specification is necessary.

  Write out the expression for the acceleration of the CoM of the stick, you will see that the cross product actually goes to zero for this problem. Eventually, both two terms at the right side of AMB of the stick go to zero, so the hinge can be at any point.

  The hinge can be at any point on the stick.
