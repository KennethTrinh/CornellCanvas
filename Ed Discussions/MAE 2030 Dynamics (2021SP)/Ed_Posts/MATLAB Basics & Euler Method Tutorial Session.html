  Hi everybody,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  To make sure everyone's prepared to use MATLAB for solving numerical differential equations, I'll be giving a MATLAB tutorial this
  <bold>
   Thursday February 11th at 7 PM
  </bold>
  over Zoom. The idea is to start off with the absolute basics (how to write an array, how to write a for loop, etc.) and then show how you can use these to build an ODE solver from scratch based on the Euler method.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The Zoom link is
  <link href="https://cornell.zoom.us/j/94957181714?pwd=RGt5OW9YeE01ZVh2TDhTaWllY013UT09"/>
  here—the Meeting ID is 949 5718 1714, and the passcode is 559295.
 </paragraph>

  I don't expect it to go longer than an hour, but length will vary based on # of participants/# of questions/etc.

  That is the plan. I can’t give any explicit guarantees that it will be posted quickly (Zoom recordings are notoriously finicky to post-process), but barring any technical snafus, I’ll try to upload it as soon as possible.

 <paragraph>
  As an aside for those of you who are planning on just watching the recording—the specific content and topics I cover will be steered by audience vote, so expect the actual covered topics to be a bit different from what I posted above.

  How are students supposed to gain Matlab access. Are we expected to pay for it ourselves?

  A quick follow-up; the recording of this tutorial should now be available in the Zoom section of the course Canvas page, under Cloud recordings.

  (In the interest of your time I didn't bother to edit it or anything, so apologies if it looks sloppy.)
