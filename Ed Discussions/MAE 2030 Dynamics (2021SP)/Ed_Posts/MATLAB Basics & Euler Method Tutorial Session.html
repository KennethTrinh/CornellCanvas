 Hi everybody,
</p>
<p>
 To make sure everyone's prepared to use MATLAB for solving numerical differential equations, I'll be giving a MATLAB tutorial this
 <b>
  Thursday February 11th at 7 PM
 </b>
 over Zoom. The idea is to start off with the absolute basics (how to write an array, how to write a for loop, etc.) and then show how you can use these to build an ODE solver from scratch based on the Euler method.
</p>
<p>
 The Zoom link is
 <a href="https://cornell.zoom.us/j/94957181714?pwd=RGt5OW9YeE01ZVh2TDhTaWllY013UT09">
  here
 </a>
 —the Meeting ID is 949 5718 1714, and the passcode is 559295.
</p>
<p>
 I don't expect it to go longer than an hour, but length will vary based on # of participants/# of questions/etc.

  A quick follow-up; the recording of this tutorial should now be available in the Zoom section of the course Canvas page, under Cloud recordings.

  (In the interest of your time I didn't bother to edit it or anything, so apologies if it looks sloppy.)

   How are students supposed to gain Matlab access. Are we expected to pay for it ourselves?

    Will this be recorded and posted? Thanks!

     That is the plan. I can’t give any explicit guarantees that it will be posted quickly (Zoom recordings are notoriously finicky to post-process), but barring any technical snafus, I’ll try to upload it as soon as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
     As an aside for those of you who are planning on just watching the recording—the specific content and topics I cover will be steered by audience vote, so expect the actual covered topics to be a bit different from what I posted above.
    </p>
