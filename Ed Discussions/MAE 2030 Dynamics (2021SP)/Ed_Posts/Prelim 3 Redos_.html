 Hi!
</p>
<p>
 Just wondering when the prelim 3 solutions will be posted/if they could be posted soon. I was hoping to get my corrections done soon (before the heart of finals season), and also would like to learn from my mistakes on prelim 3 before studying for the final.
</p>
<p>
 Thanks!
</p>

  I just made a "master" post on Canvas with Prelim 3 exercises, solutions, and commentary/statistics; you can access it
  <a href="https://canvas.cornell.edu/courses/25081/discussion_topics/274015">
   here
  </a>
  . Let us know if anything's bugged/missing.
