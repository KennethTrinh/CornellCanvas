  Hi!
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Just wondering when the prelim 3 solutions will be posted/if they could be posted soon. I was hoping to get my corrections done soon (before the heart of finals season), and also would like to learn from my mistakes on prelim 3 before studying for the final.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thanks!
