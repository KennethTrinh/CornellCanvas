 There was a mistake in the solution for part d). The x component of the force should be:
</p>
<math>
 -mR\omega^2
</math>
<p>
 Otherwise it doesn't have the correct unit. It just so happens that the value of omega was taken to be 1 in the code, so the plots are unchanged.
</p>
<p>
 The corrected version of the solution has been added to the problem folder.
