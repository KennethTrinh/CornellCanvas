 What is your question?

<p>
 In the rubric we were asked to fill out as part of the peer review, there is a space asking about whether or not the reviewee has completed their peer review. Should we be leaving this part of the rubric blank? I don't see how we can score them seeing as 1) we can't see their peer reviews and 2) even if we could, there would be no guarantee they weren't planning to do it later (but still before the deadline).
