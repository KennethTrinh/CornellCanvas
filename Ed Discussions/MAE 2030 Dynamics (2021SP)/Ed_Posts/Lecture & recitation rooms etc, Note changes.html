 A few logistics things you should note.
</p>
<list style="number">
 <li>
  <p>
   The in-person lecture room has changed from  Morrill 106 to Thurston 203.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Thurston 203 is not going to be ready for us on Monday February 8, so we will start the course with online only.  The link for this is in Canvas. Assume the course is staying online-only until I announce that in-person is starting.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Recitations are starting on Monday February 8.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   The in-person recitation room has changed from Upson 216 to Upson 142.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   The in-person recitations are not being recorded nor broadcast, if you can't make it contact the TA of an online recitation and see if there is space for you.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   The on-line recitations are linked in Canvas.
  </p>
 </li>

  <p>
   Please read and absorb  to the previous "Welcome" and "Technology" posts and prepare appropriately in the various ways.
