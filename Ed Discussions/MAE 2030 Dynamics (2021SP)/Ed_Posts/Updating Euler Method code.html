 What is your question?
</callout>
<p>
 In lecture today, the professor showed us a way to make our solver a bit more versatile (moving one of the functions to a separate file..etc). Do we need to do this in our homework as well?

 Describe the solution attempts you've made thus far.

  Do you need to, no.  Is it hard to do, no. Is it a good idea, yes.  So yes it would be advisable to make one excellent myEulerSolver() function and put it in a seperate file and use it repeatedly.

   But!...   For this first HW its fine if you leave it all in one file. A separate function is required, a separate file is not.
