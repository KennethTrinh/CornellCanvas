  What is your question?

 <paragraph>
  In lecture today, the professor showed us a way to make our solver a bit more versatile (moving one of the functions to a separate file..etc). Do we need to do this in our homework as well?

  Do you need to, no.  Is it hard to do, no. Is it a good idea, yes.  So yes it would be advisable to make one excellent myEulerSolver() function and put it in a seperate file and use it repeatedly.

  But!...   For this first HW its fine if you leave it all in one file. A separate function is required, a separate file is not.
