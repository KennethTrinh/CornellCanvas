 Which problem are you working on? (ex. HW 1, Problem 3, 9.1.15)

<p>
 HW 13, Problem 71, 19.1.1

 What is your question?

<p>
 Hi, I noticed the old solution for part c (angular momentum for the bead at t=0) has the unit kg*m/s. I don't think this is the correct unit for angular momentum.

 Describe the solution attempts you've made thus far.
</callout>
<p>
 The correct unit is kg*m^2/s right? Because H = r x mv... the extra "m" comes from the r vector.
