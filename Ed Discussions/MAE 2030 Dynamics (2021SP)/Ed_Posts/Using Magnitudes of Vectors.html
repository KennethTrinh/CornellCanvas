 What is your question?
</callout>
<p>
 If we clearly label things as magnitudes, not vectors, can we solve the algebraic part in terms of magnitudes and use logic to find the direction of the result?
</p>
<callout type="info">
 Describe the solution attempts you've made thus far.
</callout>
<p>
 For example, if I clearly labeled that I was doing the sum of the forces in a certain direction and therefore would be able to add the magnitudes of the forces or components in that direction. This would be instead of using vectors all the time and constantly using the dot product.

  The word "magnitude" is used sloppily in the context of vectors.  Really people usually mean by that "the scalar part of a scalar vector product."

 </p>
 <p>
  For example we often write something like   $\vec{\bm F} =  F\hat {\bm\lambda}$. The direction of $\hat{\bm\lambda}$ is given.  So, to cover all possibilities, the scalar $F$ can be positive or negative.

  That is, "no" you should not be figuring out the signs of things at the end using logic.  You use the calculation to get the full answer, including the signs.  This is useful.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are problems where you are not smart enough to figure out the direction from logic.  You have to use the calculation to tell you whether the final answer is a force to the left or to the right. And this involves figuring out whether the scalar-multiple part of a vector is positive or negative.
 </p>
 <p>
  For a 1D problem it's ok to skip the vectors.  But then you still need a clear sign convention, for example that "$x$ is the distance that the mass is to the right of O".  Then, if you find a negative $x$ you know that $x$ is to the left.   Or, in short hand, you could just right "Sign convention:" and draw an arrow to the right next to a "+" sign.  And then it would be assumed that to-the-right was positive for all variables, so that if, for example, you got $F = -10$N you would know that $\vec\bm F$ was a vector with a magnitude of 10N pointing to the left.

  If, after reading the book about vectors, this is still not clear, ask me about it in office hours.
