  I've been trying to access the Zoom office hours for today, but I just get the message "Unauthorized. Sorry, your session was expired. Please refresh the page or login again."
 </paragraph>

  I have tried re-signing into Zoom, resetting Canvas, etc. and nothing works. Are there any alternate links that we can use?

  Edit: The link attached to the office hours schedule doesn't work, but the link under the "Zoom tab' does. I'll leave this up in case anybody else runs into the same issue.

  This also happens to me today. I was not able to lauch zoom by clicking on the 'start' button. I have to type in the meeting ID to join zoom.
