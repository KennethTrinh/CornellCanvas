  I would like a volunteer to set up a poll.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  On which day at 11:59 PM due students most want HW due.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For each student who completes the poll I want an ordered list of 7 numbers, including the integers 1 through 7, exactly once each.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Monday = 1, Tuesday = 2, Wednesday = 3, Thursday = 4, Friday = 5, Saturday = 6, Sunday = 7.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For example, the list from one student
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2 5 3 4 7 6 1
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  is interpreted to mean that that  student most wants HW due Tuesday, 2nd best is Friday, 3rd best is Wed ...worst is Monday.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I would like a table with no commas or tabs, just numbers and spaces, with one row for each student and one column for each preference (first preference, 2nd, ... 7th). The table is $n\times7$ where $n$ is the number of student voters. Each row needs 7 different entries.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  That is, each student gives a ranked list of their preference as a sequence of numbers.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  And you, volunteer TA,  give me a table of numbers  that has all of the votes.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  I will use that table to find the best day using a system called "majority rule".  That is, using the preference lists above and a Matlab script, I will find the day that would win a pairwise vote against any other day when choosing which day HW should be due.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The poll should open and close in the next few days. I would like as many students as possible to vote.  Tell them that it matters, I will change the day depending on the vote.

  "Majority rule" is a voting concept which, common as it sounds, is a method for groups to most fairly pick an option from amongst multiple alternatives. It's probably more subtle than you think. The key is that no matter people's preferences, the outcome depends on the method of voting. And 'majority rule' is the most fair of these.

  Spoiler alert: if the 2016 Republican primary had used 'majority rule', Trump would probably not have been the Republican nominee.

  If you volunteer to crete this poll, post here so that the poll is not set up twice.
  <break>
  </break>
  I'll run the algorithm unless it gives you pleasure to also do that.
