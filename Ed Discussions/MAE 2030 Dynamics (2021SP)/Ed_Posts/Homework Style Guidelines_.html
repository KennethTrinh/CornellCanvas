  The "Homework Style Guidelines" page on Canvas appears to link to a document intended for TAs grading the homework. However, in the first week of classes, I remember this linking to a page for students that detailed exactly what is expected of us on the homework. I can no longer find this page, and the document for TAs is difficult interpret as a student. Would it be possible to put the more student-oriented page back up?

  If I am not mistaken, there seem to be a few aspects of the policy that are not mentioned on that page, particularly the "solutions quality" aspect, the "self-contained" information, and the "can do, don't want to do" policy. I am also hoping to find more information about the possible redo policy.

      As it points out, this is planned to be done at the end of the semester for all redone homework problems all at once.

  This document is both a guide for graders to help assign grades, as well as a guide for gradees to know what is being graded and what is expected. Telling graders how to grade and telling students what to do contains mostly the same information.
