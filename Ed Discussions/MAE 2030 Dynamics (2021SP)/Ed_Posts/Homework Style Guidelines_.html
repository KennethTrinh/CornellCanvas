 The "Homework Style Guidelines" page on Canvas appears to link to a document intended for TAs grading the homework. However, in the first week of classes, I remember this linking to a page for students that detailed exactly what is expected of us on the homework. I can no longer find this page, and the document for TAs is difficult interpret as a student. Would it be possible to put the more student-oriented page back up?

   If I am not mistaken, there seem to be a few aspects of the policy that are not mentioned on that page, particularly the "solutions quality" aspect, the "self-contained" information, and the "can do, don't want to do" policy. I am also hoping to find more information about the possible redo policy.

    Well, those aspects are in the Style Guidelines document you already looked at:
   </p>
   <list style="bullet">
    <li>
     <p>
      Solutions quality: 5(e)
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      Self contained: 5(f)
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      Can't do, don't want to: 5(i)
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      Regrading: 5(j) and 5(k).
     </p>
     <list style="bullet">
      <li>
       <p>
        As it points out, this is planned to be done at the end of the semester for all redone homework problems all at once.
       </p>
      </li>
     </list>
    </li>
   </list>

    This document is both a guide for graders to help assign grades, as well as a guide for gradees to know what is being graded and what is expected. Telling graders how to grade and telling students what to do contains mostly the same information.
