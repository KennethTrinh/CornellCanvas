 The lucky few who are in the Live and In Person lecture in Thurston 203.
</p>
<p>
 On Monday March 1 at 1:30 we are trying 'Live and In Person' lectures again.  Various technical improvements are said to be looking good:  various settings, training of the camera-person, eithernet instead of wireless, and some kind of laptop improvement.

 If you are in the lucky few, please show up.
