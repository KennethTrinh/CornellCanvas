  1) Old exams.
 </b>
 Here are some old exams to look at. You have to judge whether a question you see on an old exam question is within a given prelim's coverage (coverage, pace and prelim timing vary from semester to semester).

  2) Coverage:
 </b>
 Through the homework handed in on Saturday, Feb. 28.  Through the lecture on March 3. Through text reading relevant to the coverage so far.  All relevant material from pre-requisite courses.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  3) Some details:
 </b>
 Closed notes/books etc.  No calculators.  The exam is designed to be easily completed (if you know the material perfectly) in under 90 minutes.  But you will have 90 minutes over time so that there is no time pressure.  Bring food and writing equipment. All books, bags and coats need to be out of sight (under a seat next to you).  You may be asked to write or read Matlab. Look at 2019 exam covers to learn the details of the exam policies.

   If we are asked to write Matlab does that mean on a computer or written by hand on the exam sheet?

    If we are remote students, are we going to take the exact same exam via zoom with our camera on?
