  Could we see what the empty Prelim 1 grading rubric looks like? In studying for Prelim 2, It would be helpful to see how the cover page brief translates into grading, given that we could not get more individualized feedback on Prelim 1.

  The gradescope rubrics are not meaningful unless you know how they are used.
