  In office hours today a student wanted help modifying Euler's method into the midpoint method.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Together we wrote a version of
  <code>
   ODE2
  </code>
  .  The version we wrote does not have
  <code>
   options.RelTol
  </code>
  and
  <code>
   options.maxtime
  </code>
  .  We just kept it simple to highlight the midpoint method.  If you want to do the homework by copying examples you would have to merge about 4  lines of this code with ODE1 which I posted last Friday.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Here is the code (far below), demonstrated with the forced damped harmonic oscillator.  A prize for the first person who can explain the output shown for the parameters in the example. A good answer would, amongst other things, predict the final time used.   Post below. Can be anonymous-to-students if you are humble.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If you just want to quickly look at the midpoint part of it, here that is. The key 4 lines are near the bottom.
 </paragraph>
 <pre>function [tarray, zarray] = ODE2(eqn,tarray,z0)
% 2nd order ODE solver, called, for obvious reasons, 'The midpoint method'
% It is also called 'RK2'
%    -Andy Ruina , Feb 24, 2021
% This has no error estimation and no max time.
% That is, no use of options.maxtime, &amp; also without options.RelTol
% Uses tarray and not tspan.

ntimes  = length(tarray);        % user proves tarray, this counts the elements.
nstates = length(z0);            % This counts the number of first order ODEs
zarray  = zeros(ntimes,nstates); % Initialize the solution matrix

zarray(1,:) = z0'; % First row of solution is the initial condition
znew        = z0;  % Needed for the first time through the solution loop

 % once through for each time interva
 for i = 1:ntimes-1    % start midpoint loop
     znow  = znew;         % z at start of step
     tnow  = tarray(i);    % t at start of step
     tnew  = tarray(i+1);  % t at end of step
     h     = tnew - tnow;  % size of time step
     thalf = tnow + h/2;   % t , half way through a step

    %The next 4 lines are the midpoint method
     zdotnow  = eqn(tnow,znow);          % zdot at start of step
     zhalf    = znow + (h/2) * zdotnow;  % Take half a step
     zdothalf = eqn(thalf,zhalf);        % find zdot at the half step
     znew     = znow + h * zdothalf;     % The heart of the whole thing

     zarray(i+1,:) = znew';              % put the new z into the zarray

 end % end midpoint loop

end % end of ODE2

  My understanding of what needs to be explained is the shape of the plot being a low frequency envelope carrying a higher frequency wave.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  In short, I think the answer is related to beat frequency and average frequency, which creates the effect of an envelope which is seen in the plot.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I begin with an analytic solution of the ODE
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  mx"+cx'+kx=F_0\sin\left(\omega_0t\right)
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  which for the constants given becomes
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  x"+x=\sin\left(\omega_0t\right)
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  The particular solution is of form
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  A\cos\left(\omega_0t\right)+B\sin\left(\omega_0t\right)
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  and the homogeneous solution of form
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  \exp\left[\lambda t\right]
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  where lambda in this case is
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  \pm\frac{\sqrt{-4}}{2}=\pm i
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  Then, the homogeneous solution is of form
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  C\cos t+D\sin t
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  This results in the following:
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  x=A\cos\left(\omega_0t\right)+B\sin\left(\omega_0t\right)+C\cos\left(t\right)+D\sin\left(t\right)
 </math>
 <math>
  x'=-\omega_0A\sin\left(\omega_0t\right)+\omega_0B\cos\left(\omega_0t\right)-C\sin t+D\cos t
 </math>
 <math>
  x"=-\omega_0^2A\cos\left(\omega_0t\right)-\omega_0^2B\sin\left(\omega_0t\right)-C\cos\left(t\right)-D\sin\left(t\right)
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  Plugging in initial conditions gives
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  A+C=0,\ B\omega_0+D=0
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  I plug back into the ODE, giving
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  \left(1-\omega_0^2\right)A\cos\left(\omega_0t\right)+\left(1-\omega_0^2\right)B\sin\left(\omega_0t\right)=\sin\left(\omega_0t\right)
 </math>
 <math>
  A=0,\ B=\frac{1}{1-\omega_0^2}
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  Using the equations relating A and B to C and D gives
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  C=0,\ D=-\frac{\omega_0}{1-\omega_0^2}
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  Ultimately,
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  x=\frac{1}{1-\omega_0^2}\left(-\omega_0\sin\left(t\right)+\sin\left(\omega_0t\right)\right)
 </math>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  This is a superposition of two waves. To analyze this, I thought of the example in physics 2214 of two sound waves. The sound heard when two distinct notes are played has the average of their frequencies, and a beat frequency that is the difference between them. Since the given driving frequency of 1.01 /s is close to the natural frequency of 1, there is a beating effect.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The average frequency is 1.005 /s, which matches with the pseudo period of the wave, 6.25s (by dividing 2pi by omega_average).
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The beat frequency is 0.01 /s, which matches with the envelope period of the wave, 628.3s (by dividing 2pi by omega_difference).
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Edited because the /s inadvertently created hyperlinks.

  In response to Professor Ruina's last comment, this is an explanation of the envelope behavior:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Begin with result from original comment:
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  x=\frac{1}{1-\omega_0^2}\left(-\omega_0\sin t+\sin\left(\omega_0t\right)\right)
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  Add and subtract a term to equalize amplitudes
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  x=\frac{1}{1-\omega_0^2}\left(-\omega_0\sin t+\sin\left(\omega_0t\right)+\left(\omega_0-1\right)\sin\left(\omega_0t\right)-\left(\omega_0-1\right)\sin\left(\omega_0t\right)\right)
 </math>
 <math>
  x=\frac{1}{1-\omega_0^2}\left(-\omega_0\sin t+\omega_0\sin\left(\omega_0t\right)-\left(\omega_0-1\right)\sin\left(\omega_0t\right)\right)
 </math>
 <math>
  x=\frac{\omega_0}{1-\omega_0^2}\left(\sin\left(-t\right)+\sin\left(\omega_0t\right)\right)-\frac{\omega_0-1}{1-\omega_0^2}\sin\left(\omega_0t\right)
 </math>
 <math>
  x=\frac{\omega_0}{1-\omega_0^2}\left(2\sin\left(\frac{\left(\omega_0-1\right)t}{2}\right)\cos\left(\frac{\left(\omega_0+1\right)t}{2}\right)\right)+\frac{1}{1+\omega_0}\sin\left(\omega_0t\right)
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  The second term has a small effect on the total wave, as its amplitude is less than 0.5. The shape of the wave is mostly due to the first term, which is a product of the high frequency and low frequency expressions.

  Eugene:  I think I have to give you full credit.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  In short, there  is a beating of the homogeneous solution and the particular solution.  You know that they have to cancel at the start.  And you know they cancel again after 100 oscillations.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  But, without just quoting a result from another class, can you explain what the shape of the outer curve is?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  You have to claim your prize:  coffee with the professor! lucky you.  Once the weather is nice.

  If the solutions were of equal amplitude, I would have used a sum to product identity, which would allow me to express the general solution as a product of a sine and cosine, one of which would have described the envelope curve. I think the different amplitude makes the resulting shape imperfect, but in this case it was close enough.

  You can add and subract a term to make the two added sine waves have the same amplitude, and then you have just a tiny sine wave left over. You then, in  sum, get a slow sinewave with huge amplitude multiplying a fast sine wave.  Plus a tiny fast sine wave.  You could edit your post with that to get cream (or soy milk) with the coffee or tea I'll buy for you.

  I think it may be obvious to you, about I don't think it shines out to most people that, because $\omega_0 \approx1$ the amplitude is huge and one frequency is about 1 and the other much slower.  It would be good to explain that as well as possible.  Then you get a cookie with the cream (or soy milk) with your coffee.

  I gather, from class today,  and your comfort with the stuff above, that your math background is somewhow better than that of most students.
