 In office hours today a student wanted help modifying Euler's method into the midpoint method.
</p>
<p>
 Together we wrote a version of
 <code>
  ODE2
 </code>
 .  The version we wrote does not have
 <code>
  options.RelTol
 </code>
 and
 <code>
  options.maxtime
 </code>
 .  We just kept it simple to highlight the midpoint method.  If you want to do the homework by copying examples you would have to merge about 4  lines of this code with ODE1 which I posted last Friday.
</p>
<p>
 Here is the code (far below), demonstrated with the forced damped harmonic oscillator.  A prize for the first person who can explain the output shown for the parameters in the example. A good answer would, amongst other things, predict the final time used.   Post below. Can be anonymous-to-students if you are humble.
</p>
<p>
 If you just want to quickly look at the midpoint part of it, here that is. The key 4 lines are near the bottom.
</p>
<pre>function [tarray, zarray] = ODE2(eqn,tarray,z0)
% 2nd order ODE solver, called, for obvious reasons, 'The midpoint method'
% It is also called 'RK2'
%    -Andy Ruina , Feb 24, 2021
% This has no error estimation and no max time.
% That is, no use of options.maxtime, &amp; also without options.RelTol
% Uses tarray and not tspan.

ntimes  = length(tarray);        % user proves tarray, this counts the elements.
nstates = length(z0);            % This counts the number of first order ODEs
zarray  = zeros(ntimes,nstates); % Initialize the solution matrix

zarray(1,:) = z0'; % First row of solution is the initial condition
znew        = z0;  % Needed for the first time through the solution loop

 % once through for each time interva
 for i = 1:ntimes-1    % start midpoint loop
     znow  = znew;         % z at start of step
     tnow  = tarray(i);    % t at start of step
     tnew  = tarray(i+1);  % t at end of step
     h     = tnew - tnow;  % size of time step
     thalf = tnow + h/2;   % t , half way through a step

    %The next 4 lines are the midpoint method
     zdotnow  = eqn(tnow,znow);          % zdot at start of step
     zhalf    = znow + (h/2) * zdotnow;  % Take half a step
     zdothalf = eqn(thalf,zhalf);        % find zdot at the half step
     znew     = znow + h * zdothalf;     % The heart of the whole thing

     zarray(i+1,:) = znew';              % put the new z into the zarray

 end % end midpoint loop

end % end of ODE2

  My understanding of what needs to be explained is the shape of the plot being a low frequency envelope carrying a higher frequency wave.
 </p>
 <p>
  In short, I think the answer is related to beat frequency and average frequency, which creates the effect of an envelope which is seen in the plot.
 </p>
 <p>
  I begin with an analytic solution of the ODE
 </p>
 <math>
  mx"+cx'+kx=F_0\sin\left(\omega_0t\right)
 </math>
 <p>
  which for the constants given becomes
 </p>
 <math>
  x"+x=\sin\left(\omega_0t\right)
 </math>
 <p>
  The particular solution is of form
 </p>
 <math>
  A\cos\left(\omega_0t\right)+B\sin\left(\omega_0t\right)
 </math>
 <p>
  and the homogeneous solution of form
 </p>
 <math>
  \exp\left[\lambda t\right]
 </math>
 <p>
  where lambda in this case is
 </p>
 <math>
  \pm\frac{\sqrt{-4}}{2}=\pm i
 </math>
 <p>
  Then, the homogeneous solution is of form
 </p>
 <math>
  C\cos t+D\sin t
 </math>
 <p>
  This results in the following:
 </p>
 <math>
  x=A\cos\left(\omega_0t\right)+B\sin\left(\omega_0t\right)+C\cos\left(t\right)+D\sin\left(t\right)
 </math>
 <math>
  x'=-\omega_0A\sin\left(\omega_0t\right)+\omega_0B\cos\left(\omega_0t\right)-C\sin t+D\cos t
 </math>
 <math>
  x"=-\omega_0^2A\cos\left(\omega_0t\right)-\omega_0^2B\sin\left(\omega_0t\right)-C\cos\left(t\right)-D\sin\left(t\right)
 </math>
 <p>
  Plugging in initial conditions gives
 </p>
 <math>
  A+C=0,\ B\omega_0+D=0
 </math>
 <p>
  I plug back into the ODE, giving
 </p>
 <math>
  \left(1-\omega_0^2\right)A\cos\left(\omega_0t\right)+\left(1-\omega_0^2\right)B\sin\left(\omega_0t\right)=\sin\left(\omega_0t\right)
 </math>
 <math>
  A=0,\ B=\frac{1}{1-\omega_0^2}
 </math>
 <p>
  Using the equations relating A and B to C and D gives
 </p>
 <math>
  C=0,\ D=-\frac{\omega_0}{1-\omega_0^2}
 </math>
 <p>
  Ultimately,
 </p>
 <math>
  x=\frac{1}{1-\omega_0^2}\left(-\omega_0\sin\left(t\right)+\sin\left(\omega_0t\right)\right)
 </math>
 <p>
  This is a superposition of two waves. To analyze this, I thought of the example in physics 2214 of two sound waves. The sound heard when two distinct notes are played has the average of their frequencies, and a beat frequency that is the difference between them. Since the given driving frequency of 1.01 /s is close to the natural frequency of 1, there is a beating effect.
 </p>
 <p>
  The average frequency is 1.005 /s, which matches with the pseudo period of the wave, 6.25s (by dividing 2pi by omega_average).
 </p>
 <p>
  The beat frequency is 0.01 /s, which matches with the envelope period of the wave, 628.3s (by dividing 2pi by omega_difference).
 </p>
 <p>
  Edited because the /s inadvertently created hyperlinks.

   Eugene:  I think I have to give you full credit.
  </p>
  <p>
   In short, there  is a beating of the homogeneous solution and the particular solution.  You know that they have to cancel at the start.  And you know they cancel again after 100 oscillations.
  </p>
  <p>
   But, without just quoting a result from another class, can you explain what the shape of the outer curve is?
  </p>
  <p>
   You have to claim your prize:  coffee with the professor! lucky you.  Once the weather is nice.

    If the solutions were of equal amplitude, I would have used a sum to product identity, which would allow me to express the general solution as a product of a sine and cosine, one of which would have described the envelope curve. I think the different amplitude makes the resulting shape imperfect, but in this case it was close enough.

     You can add and subract a term to make the two added sine waves have the same amplitude, and then you have just a tiny sine wave left over. You then, in  sum, get a slow sinewave with huge amplitude multiplying a fast sine wave.  Plus a tiny fast sine wave.  You could edit your post with that to get cream (or soy milk) with the coffee or tea I'll buy for you.

      I think it may be obvious to you, about I don't think it shines out to most people that, because $\omega_0 \approx1$ the amplitude is huge and one frequency is about 1 and the other much slower.  It would be good to explain that as well as possible.  Then you get a cookie with the cream (or soy milk) with your coffee.

      I gather, from class today,  and your comfort with the stuff above, that your math background is somewhow better than that of most students.

     In response to Professor Ruina's last comment, this is an explanation of the envelope behavior:
    </p>
    <p>
     Begin with result from original comment:
    </p>
    <math>
     x=\frac{1}{1-\omega_0^2}\left(-\omega_0\sin t+\sin\left(\omega_0t\right)\right)
    </math>
    <p>
     Add and subtract a term to equalize amplitudes
    </p>
    <math>
     x=\frac{1}{1-\omega_0^2}\left(-\omega_0\sin t+\sin\left(\omega_0t\right)+\left(\omega_0-1\right)\sin\left(\omega_0t\right)-\left(\omega_0-1\right)\sin\left(\omega_0t\right)\right)
    </math>
    <math>
     x=\frac{1}{1-\omega_0^2}\left(-\omega_0\sin t+\omega_0\sin\left(\omega_0t\right)-\left(\omega_0-1\right)\sin\left(\omega_0t\right)\right)
    </math>
    <math>
     x=\frac{\omega_0}{1-\omega_0^2}\left(\sin\left(-t\right)+\sin\left(\omega_0t\right)\right)-\frac{\omega_0-1}{1-\omega_0^2}\sin\left(\omega_0t\right)
    </math>
    <math>
     x=\frac{\omega_0}{1-\omega_0^2}\left(2\sin\left(\frac{\left(\omega_0-1\right)t}{2}\right)\cos\left(\frac{\left(\omega_0+1\right)t}{2}\right)\right)+\frac{1}{1+\omega_0}\sin\left(\omega_0t\right)
    </math>
    <p>
     The second term has a small effect on the total wave, as its amplitude is less than 0.5. The shape of the wave is mostly due to the first term, which is a product of the high frequency and low frequency expressions.
