  You are free to keep developing and using your ODE2. That will work fine.  ODE45 has some bells and whistles, which we will get to, which might take some effort to do well in your own ODE2. Only for extreme accuracies, however, will ODE45 be usefully faster than ODE2. The main big improvement is from Euler to ODE2.

  In sum, now that you know what ODE numerical solution is all about, you can use whatever solver works for you.  Matlab has at least

  8 of them. It has more of them that are less conspicuously documented. Most people I know just use ODE45 and don't think about it. But some people get all involved with the nuances.
