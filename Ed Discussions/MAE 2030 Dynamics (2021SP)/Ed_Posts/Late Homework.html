  Under the Homework Information page it says we can submit late homework up until the due date of the next assignment for a point deduction, but I noticed on Canvas that submissions were locked for HW3. Is this policy still in effect?

  You can submit late homework at any point, with more drastic penalty corresponding to more drastic lateness. Canvas needs to lock in order to get Peer Reviews assigned reasonably soon after the deadline. After Canvas is locked, you need to Private post (as described on Canvas) on Ed Discussion and the grader assigned to you that week will handle it.
