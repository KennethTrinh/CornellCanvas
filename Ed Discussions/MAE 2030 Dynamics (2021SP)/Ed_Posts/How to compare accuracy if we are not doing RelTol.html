 Since the problem says we can replace RelTol with nsteps if the coding is to complex for us. But if we do that, how should we compare the time used to reach a certain accuracy with different solvers?

  You can run your code a two times, one with twice the number of steps as the other.  The difference between the two is your estimate for the error of the course one.
