  I usually use ctrl-f on the problem number (almost always unique) to search for the problem. I think all PDF viewers (including Chrome) should allow this... has that been posing an issue for people? Can you describe the problem? (Let us knowðŸ¤ )

  I had tried this and there were 0 results. I just copied what was on canvas so not sure why it didn't come up.

  Simple search works for me

  Also, problem 6.4.18 is in the problems at the end of Chapter 6, in the set associated with 6.4.  It is easy to find that either by looking at the table of contents or by looking at the tops of the pages.
