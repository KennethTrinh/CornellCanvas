  If you are planning to take the prelim 3 and/or the final remotely, please read this carefully.

   <italic>
    If you do not have a good zoom caera setup at prelim 3, for whatever good or bad reason, you will be deflected to the makeup prelim at the end of the semester.

    For the final, we may deflect you to a makeup final.

  Your setup needs to make it nearly impossible for you to cheat.

 <paragraph>
  If you already took an online prelim, there is about a 50% chance that you did not do this well.  Please read below carefully.

  Look at this setup:
  <link href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/3996/discussion/threads/167"/>
  #167
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Camera about 5' from you.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Camera shows your computer screen, your clear desk, and you.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  If you use phone camera, you need a tripod (or coat hanger bent to work), and your power supply connected.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If you use a webcam, you need an extension cable (buy it today if you don't have one), and a tripod  (or coat hanger bent to function like one).
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  Read the bold text up top again.

  If you took Prelim 2 online and would like to check if your setup was appropriate, comment below or email me (around half of them are not going to fly for Prelim 3). You can do the same if you would like to verify your setup before the exam.

  yours was lacking in a lot of ways, you just need to look a lot more like #167 (can see you, your workspace, and your computer clearly, not too close nor too far)

  Mike yours was good except that your camera was too close. If you fix that you are good to go. You can send me a screenshot if you make the adjustment and want to verify it.
