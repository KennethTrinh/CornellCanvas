  I didn't do some of the prelim redo assignments because I was already happy with my score. These assignments are now marked as missing and I have a zero for them. Just wanted to make sure not submitting these won't bring down our grades.

  A grade of zero on prelim redos is a perfect score if your original was 20 or higher.  Our super sophisticated grading software will figure this all out.
