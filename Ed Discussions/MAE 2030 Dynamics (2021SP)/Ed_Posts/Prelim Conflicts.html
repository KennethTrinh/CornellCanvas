 With the prelim schedules recently being released, I found out that I have a class that has a prelim scheduled for the same day as Prelim 3, at the same time. What is the procedure for this, or who should I contact?
</p>
<p>
 In the past, I've been told that the class with the larger enrollment generally accommodates for the conflict, which would not be 2030 in this case, but I wanted to check in ahead of time just in case.
</p>
<p>
 If anyone else is wondering, the class is CHEM 1570.

    If we have to deal with it, which I hope we do not, we have two mechanisms:
    <break>
    </break>
    1) Early exam.  Start a few hours early and stay until just before the other exam starts; and
   </p>

   <p>
    End of semester makeup exam, to make up for any exams missed, whatever the reason.
    <break>
    </break>
