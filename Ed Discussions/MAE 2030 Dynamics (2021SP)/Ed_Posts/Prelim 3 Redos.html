  I also had an issue with my redo for this question. I don't know if you had the same issue, but I lost a point and my redo was rejected because I defined the force due to friction in my diagram setup as 'mu*N' as I used it in my LMB, while this is not always the case. However, this was done in the staff solution for question 8 on the same prelim. Are regrade requests available?

  Not getting 20 for redo does not mean your redo is rejected. It means that your final score for the problem will be the average with the given score (in your case 19) instead of 20. It is a valid for question 8 because friction force in question 8 is always mu N, while it isn't necessarily the case for q7 b.

  There is no regrade request for prelim Redos.
