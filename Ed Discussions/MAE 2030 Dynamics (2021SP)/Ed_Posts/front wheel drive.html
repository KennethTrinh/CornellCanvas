  Section 203... I thought of a better way to explain the front wheel drive friction thing:

  I was looking through my freshman physics notes (yay for finding those), and I had this down:

  (Ignoring the kinda irrelevant angular velocity) Doesn't front-wheel drive work via static friction i.e. rolling without slipping, and not skidding friction? I also looked online, and it seems like skidding is when the wheels lock and there's

  friction bc you're still moving forward.

  One could write a Ph.D. thesis on the relation between between static and dynamic friction.

  Someone has, in fact.

  The issue here isn't really about that.  It's an issue of sliding or not sliding.  When sliding we have, according to Coulomb's law (also called D'avinci's law) $ F= \mu N$ there the force direction is such that it opposes the relative motion. When there is no sliding all that you know is that  $|F| \le \mu N$.

  Oh yeah you're right, it seems my terminology wasn't correct... I didn't even know those were official terms! Good catch...
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  That said, I think the concept that I was trying to describe is still correct - one in which the back wheel (a roller) doesn't have a significant reaction force while the front wheel (modeled as locked for the purposes of finding that threshold mu) does.

  This has made me think more about friction than I have ever wanted to think about friction... it is fun though, good to ponder these things... üòäüëç

  I am not quite sure what the issue is. However, my thoughts on related issues are in my book, especially in figures 2.2, and in sections 2.4 and 5.3.

  Here's how I explained in my section: Because the car is front wheel drive, there is a torque $\tau$ on the front wheel. And because the car is moving at constant speed, there needs a friction $f$ that counteracts the torque. The gravity $G_F$ and the normal force $N_F$ don't provide moments. Similarly, because there is no driving force/torque on the rear wheel, there can't be a friction - otherwise the moment is unbalanced and the wheel will accelerate counterclockwise.
