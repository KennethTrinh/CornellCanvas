 Hi Everybody,
</p>
<p>
 On behalf of the course staff, we would like to congratulate you all on successfully completing MAE 2030 this spring.  This is not an easy course and on the whole, you did quite well. Final grades should be published on Canvas.  If you have questions about your grade (grades are FINAL barring any calculation errors) please reach out to your TA (cc prof Ruina), or respond to this post.
</p>
<p>
 Furthermore, we published the final exam solutions as well as statistics and reflections today on canvas in the final exam module.  Please look at these, as reflecting on your work is a great way to improve.
</p>
<p>
 Finally, have fun this summer, maybe learn something, and good luck in the fall. Junior year is a very rewarding year. It is when my cohort became much more tight-knit which is a defining part of my Cornell experience. [end whistful senior ramblings].
</p>

  I still don't see my grade calculations or information about grade cutoffs. is it just the letter grade on Student Center or has something not been marked as published?

   May I ask where can we find it? There's no "final grade" in the Grades tab on canvas.
