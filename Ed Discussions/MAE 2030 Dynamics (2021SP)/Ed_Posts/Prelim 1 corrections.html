  For any problem in which your score is under 20 you can raise your grade.
 </p>
 <p>
  First study your solution and understand your errors.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, redo the entire problem perfectly.  Best is if you redo the problem by making right what you did wrong so you best learn the nature of your errors.
 </p>
 <p>
  This redo will be graded very strictly out of 20 (instead of 25).
 </p>
 <p>
  Your score for final grading of that problem will be the average of your original and your redo score.
 </p>
 <p>
  Canvas will have a submission place for this.
 </p>
 <p>
  Such redos are due Monday March 29 at 11:59 PM.
