  Will there be any office hours during the wellness days? I know there should not be any classes due to university regulations, but I am not sure if that is the same for office hours.

  The TAs have wellness days, so I told them to not hold office hours if they did not want to,  but may do their office hours anyway.  Check in to see if they are there.
