  At Cornell, I think a trust system is generally more effective.
 </p>
 <p>
  That would be leaving the calculator in a conspicuous location.

   Cons:
  </b>
  a thief can take it more easily. I think the chances of this are minimal at Cornell.

   Pros:
  </b>
  the student will find it if they come back and hadn't got your note. For example, perhaps it was left there before by a student in another class.

   I didn't want to leave it out so I hid it in a secret location... call my number 9168066662 when you come back and I will tell you where it is
