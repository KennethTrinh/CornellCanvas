 On the grading page it says some things about having the best 14 numbers out of a set of up to 19 numbers contribute to my letter grade.
</p>
<p>
 This semester, what exactly are numbers 7-9 (a third prelim??) and number 15 (in-class quizzes, which afaik are not currently implemented on Canvas) coming from?
</p>
<p>
 If the above 4 numbers don't exist, then there will be about 13-15 numbers remaining depending on number of projects completed, so will the best 13-14 of them still be used or will we be given additional "component drops"?
</p>
<p>
 [I'm asking because it currently seems like if I do 0 projects then I get 0 drops, which is less than what I interpreted at the beginning of the semester as $(19-2)-14 = 3$ drops for 0 projects, which then informed the detailedness of my HW write-ups and frequency of writing "can do, don't want to."]

  Hi:
 </p>
 <p>
  We will follow the intent of that grading scheme if the numbers are not  quite right. Nobody has to do any projects to get a drop or two.

  As for projects,  people who do projects just to raise their grade are wasting their time.  The projects are to reward people who want credit for pursuing their interests. People just trying to raise their grades are better off using their time to better learn the material  for the final exam.
