  What is your question?

  I'm not sure I quite understand the best method to go about finding the answer to this question

  I've got an answer for part a, and it seems correct enough, but I'm a bit stuck for this second part. I can understand how I might find v in terms of time t or even θ in terms of t (using what I know about vdot in terms of θ double dot and v in terms of θ dot). I can even imagine a way to solve for t in terms of θ and use that to find v in terms of θ but that doesn't help me because I don't know anything about initial conditions with respect to t.

  One thought I had was that I wish I could write dv/dθ where as right now I have dv/dt. I can sort of think of a way to accomplish that with chain rule but I'd need dt/dθ (I think...) which I cant figure out how I'd define.

  I feel like I'm missing a key strategy or thought process to sort this question out :/

  You're getting there! Actually, both approaches you have outlined here seem reasonable. Since only initial condition given is v(θ=0), what happens if you keep the integration constants until you have an expression for the general solution of v(θ)? For the second approach, notice that dt/dθ can be written as1/(dθ/dt), so can you find an expression of that in terms of v and θ?
