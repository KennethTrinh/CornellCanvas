   You need to be good at sharing handwritten work via Zoom.
  </bold>
 </heading>
 <paragraph>
  Why?  Discussion sections in this class are problem-based with partners.   You will work with a partner on a set of problems.  So, you need to be able to do show your work and see your partner's work, preferably at the same time.  Whether or not you are signed up for online recitations, you may end up in an online recitation sometimes.   This sharing will also be helpful for your collaborations with other students outside of class and for office hours.

 <paragraph>
  This post will outline various ways, with various hardware and software, to achieve this goal. First is how to share your writing. Second is how to do this simultaneously with another person.

    Ipad/Android tablet/surface If you have one of these devices you must also have a stylus/apple pen.  This

    guide describes how to connect/share to zoom. Joining seems from the device seems to work better for using the whiteboard feature.  We also recommend having a good note-taking app such as
    <link href="https://it.cornell.edu/software-licensing/microsof"/>
    OneNote or notability on your tablet.  Learn how to annotate on zoom and use the
    <link href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/205677665-Sharing-a-whiteboard"/>

    Wacom Tablet.  This connects to your computer.  We suggest

    this model as it is relatively affordable while still having a large writing area.  If you pursue this option make sure you practice beforehand.  As above we suggest using onenote  (
    <link href="https://it.cornell.edu/software-licensing/microsof"/>
    free for Cornell students) and the zoom

    The final option is to use your phone in conjunction with a stand.  There are a number of apps that allow you to use your phone as a webcam, here is a description of

    With this, we will either use simultaneous screen sharing (two monitors somewhat required), or participants can set their camera to their work and will be able to see each other's work side by side

  Second,
  <link href="ffice-students  https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115000424286-Sharing-multiple-screen"/>
  Set up your computer to see multiple screen shares simultaneously ( If you have access to multiple monitors that is ideal but it is not critical).  Also please update to the latest version of zoom so you can pick your own breakout room (among other features).  To update zoom, launch zoom then click your profile in the upper right-hand corner-&gt; check for updates
