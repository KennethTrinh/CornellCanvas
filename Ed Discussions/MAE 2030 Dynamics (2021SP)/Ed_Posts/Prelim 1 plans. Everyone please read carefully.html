  About tonight's prelim 1 starting at 8:30 on Thursday March 4, 2021.
 </b>
 <break>
 </break>
 We had just enough volunteers, and just enough luck and work by our TAs, to find a smaller better room than Schwartz for the prelim.
</p>
<p>
 Please read this entire post. Much of it duplicates previous posts, but we want to have all things as clear as possible.

   The exam is designed to be easily completed (if you know the material perfectly) in under 90 minutes. But you will have 90 minutes over time so that there is no time pressure.

   Bring food and writing equipment.  Have those visible, and nothing else (and also your computer if you are taking the prelim online).

   All books, bags and coats need to be out of sight (under a seat next to you).

   This is our anti-cheating system. You need a camera that has a view of your work environment and your screen. It need not show your face, but it should show your upper body and head, your paper and the desk area around you. That is, your camera view should be such that we could see if you were using your phone or computer or notes of any kind. You could use an external web cam connected to your computer with a long USB cable. Or you could use your phone (with power supply connected), set up with a small tripod or bent coat hanger or whatever.

   Keep Zoom chat open on your computer so we can make announcements.

   If possible, check the quality of your setup and camera system at any office hours.

   The main problems with the setups people have shown me are

    <p>
     Camera not far enough back; and
    </p>

     Too much clutter on and near desk.

  Hello!
 </p>
 <p>
  I currently have no assigned location for the prelim. Should I just take it  online?
