   About tonight's prelim 1 starting at 8:30 on Thursday March 4, 2021.

  We had just enough volunteers, and just enough luck and work by our TAs, to find a smaller better room than Schwartz for the prelim.

  Please read this entire post. Much of it duplicates previous posts, but we want to have all things as clear as possible.

      Keep your computer Zoom on while you scan with your phone.  Direct your computer camera so it can see you doing the scanning. As for the rest of the exam, use the

    The exam is designed to be easily completed (if you know the material perfectly) in under 90 minutes. But you will have 90 minutes over time so that there is no time pressure.

     Monitoring camera.

    This is our anti-cheating system. You need a camera that has a view of your work environment and your screen. It need not show your face, but it should show your upper body and head, your paper and the desk area around you. That is, your camera view should be such that we could see if you were using your phone or computer or notes of any kind. You could use an external web cam connected to your computer with a long USB cable. Or you could use your phone (with power supply connected), set up with a small tripod or bent coat hanger or whatever.

  I currently have no assigned location for the prelim. Should I just take it  online?
