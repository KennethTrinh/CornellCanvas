  Hi everyone,

 <paragraph>
  I just made a post on Canvas containing the prelim exercises, multiple solutions, and commentary/statistics on each problem by the associated grader, which you can find here. Hope it's helpful!

  I think there is a mistake in problem 2/8's solution?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  In professor's solution, there is a missing m on the left-hand-side of the equation for mu*N and in Arnaldo's solution there is also a 'm' missing.

  You're absolutely right! Thank you for spotting that, Wanyue. I'll upload a correct version of my solutions momentarily.

  EDIT: It's already been corrected and added to my solution.

  I think there is a mistake in Problem 7b's solution in which the right hand side in the critical case is missing a negative sign.
