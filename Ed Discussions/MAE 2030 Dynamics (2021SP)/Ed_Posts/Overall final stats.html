 Will statistics for the final be posted? I remember there was a .csv of problem performance for prelim 1, that would be nice.
</p>
<p>
 Or will these things be included with the final grade posting?

  A variety of statistics should be posted when grades are finally calculated.

  At least, that is the plan.  ETA is Tuesday night.
