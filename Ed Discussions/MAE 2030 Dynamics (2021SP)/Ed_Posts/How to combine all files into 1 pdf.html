  This may be a stupid question, but whats the best way to go about combing all of our files into one pdf? I have a .m file, a word README file, and a pdf with my written work, and I'm not sure how to combine all of those.

  You could publish the Matlab code to get a pdf file. (There's a publish button in Matlab.) And there are a lot of pdf software that allow you to combine pdf pages into one file.

  Or, you could copy paste your Matlab code and plots into a Word document and generate a pdf file.

  Alternatively, if you have a Mac, you can use Preview (drag page thumbnails into one PDF)
