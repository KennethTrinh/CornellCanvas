  This is a retreat not a surrender.  For now we do not know why the $6K camera erratically has such low resolution, it might be something about the laptop it is running through. When we figure that out, or think we have figured that out, we will try in person again. I'll let you know when that happens.

  As of this instant, 24 of 29 of you who took the poll, that's over 80% of you, prefer pencil and paper to the messed up blackboard.

  If and when we get the blackboard working decently,  we can take a poll to see whether you like that better than pencil and paper, or not.
