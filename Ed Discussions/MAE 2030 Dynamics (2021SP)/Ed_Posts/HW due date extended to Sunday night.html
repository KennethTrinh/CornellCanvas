 In the mid-semester course evaluations which I got minutes ago, several students requested that HW be due Sunday night instead of Saturday night.
</p>
<p>
 We can take a vote next week.  But for now, let's make the switch.
</p>
<p>
 The homework that was due tonight, Saturday, March 27 is now due  Sunday, March 28 at 11:59 PM.
</p>
<p>
 I will make other responses to other things in those evaluations in the coming days.

  Just to make sure, the due date on Canvas has not changed and still says it is due tonight.
