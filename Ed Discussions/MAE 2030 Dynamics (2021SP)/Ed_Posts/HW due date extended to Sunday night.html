  In the mid-semester course evaluations which I got minutes ago, several students requested that HW be due Sunday night instead of Saturday night.

  We can take a vote next week.  But for now, let's make the switch.

  The homework that was due tonight, Saturday, March 27 is now due  Sunday, March 28 at 11:59 PM.

  I will make other responses to other things in those evaluations in the coming days.
