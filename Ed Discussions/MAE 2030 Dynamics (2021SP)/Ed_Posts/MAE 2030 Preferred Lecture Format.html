  Given the technical difficulties that zoom students are dealing with with the blackboard lecture, it might be better to switch back to the format that we had in the first lecture on paper.

  Maybe we can get a preliminary vote here:

  Based on the 12 votes so far, it seems like the class is leaning heavily towards using paper.

  What I'd like is a poll like this:
  <break>
  </break>
  <italic>
   How many more days should we try to get this blackboard thing to work before reverting to "all online"?
  </italic>
  People could vote 0, meaning switch now.  Or 45, meaning it's worth it even if it's always a struggle.  Then I could go with the median. When I get to that median day, I will ask "Good enough?" and if not, then go to all online.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  What would I vote?  Probably about 2 more unless after 2 there was some special promising possibility.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  Right now we are suffering from inexperience and some bandwidth problem.

  Here are the three possibilities for lecture:
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  <bold>
   1) 100% online.
  </bold>
  No in-person component.  For this I would use two pieces of paper side-by-side, like I did in  lecture 1. I would have no mask.  I would probably only see 49 of you at a time.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  <bold>
   2) Hybrid with paper.
  </bold>
  I would lecture in the same room as now, with 9 people present.  There would be no fancy camera or camera person, I would work with 2 side-by-side pieces of paper.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <bold>
   3) Hybrid with blackboard.
  </bold>
  This is what we are trying to do.  My sense is that if we can  get the microphone to stay on (no dead batteries, no random muting), and we can get the camera to be in sharp mode all of the time, that this would be most liked by
  <italic>
   everyone.
  </italic>
 </paragraph>
 <list style="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    In Spring of 2020 I tried (1) and (3) and people prefer (3).  I also prefer (3). And obviously the in person audience prefers (3) to (2).
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
 </list>
 <paragraph>
  If I am right that (3), well done, is best, I think we have to work on it for a few more lectures.  If, on the other hand people feel that there is no hope, then we can go to  (1) all online.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  Hybrid with paper (2) is what I did for all of fall 2020.  I think the in-person audience gets little benefit relative to being online. And it's worse for the online people because  I am more constrained and awkward.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  Unless there is clear opinion that, even if it works out well it won't be that good, I would like to keep working on this hybrid thing.
