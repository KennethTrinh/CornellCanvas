 Could someone clarify the order and selection of angles we looked at for Method 3? I'm not seeing how the two blue angles here are the same.
</p>
<p>
 Also, I didn't quite catch how we got $\mu = \tan \phi$. Could someone reiterate that? Thanks!

  Sorry about that! I was trying to explain it without erasing previous lines like Andy did in lecture but I accidentally drew the angle in the wrong place. The correct notes are now uploaded onto canvas.

   Gotchya, thanks! The notes are really neat and helpful :)

   I'm not entirely sure but that drawing looks a little different from the one we saw in lecture:
   <break>

   I drew in what looks like the line where the angle ϕ is be measured to in the image you have above in red and highlighted the actual angle in blue. In the lecture drawing the angle ϕ is measured from the line of action from the front wheel and the normal direction to the slope rather than just straight down. That way the line labelled as "S" is parallel to the line where ϕ "ends" and so the two angle labelled as the same are the same.
   <break>
   </break>
   I don't think I did a good job of explaining it in writing so below is a drawing of how I think about the angles:

   and a bit more cleanly:

   As to why tanϕ is equal to μ, I had to think of what μ actually is indicating to make sense. μ equals the friction force divided by the normal force right? multiply μ by the normal and you get the friction force. In triangle terms I imagine a triangle made up of the normal force and friction force with the angle ϕ between the normal force and whatever the hypotenuse of that triangle is. tan of any angle is equal to the opposite side length divided by the adjacent side length right? So, if ϕ is the angle opposite the friction force and adjacent to the normal force, tan of ϕ will give us the ratio between those two which is the same as  μ.
   <break>
   </break>
   <break>
   </break>
   <break>
   </break>
   I hope that makes sense and I didn't say anything stupid, apologies in advance if so. This is just how I thought of the problem in an attempt to make sense of it.

    Ok yeah, so we never use $\theta$. Thanks for the last diagram, that really helped

     well I guess not for the final diagram, but, to figure out where P is (and what the value for S is) you do need to use θ (at least I had to)
     <break>
     </break>
     and of course! happy to help :)
     <break>
     </break>
     when doing stuff like trig it really helps me to just redraw stuff outside of the original diagram so I can clearly see all the angles and lines I'm looking at at that moment

      Michelle - after our discussion, I found S based on the geometry of $N_r$ and $mg$. As Oliver pointed out, you should use $\theta$ to form a triangle.

     Also, were we given $s$ at all?

      not directly during lecture but I think the thought was that you could use geometry + trig to figure out what s actually is and solve the problem from there
      <break>
      </break>
      all that we need to know is that it originates from R and is perpendicular to the slope
