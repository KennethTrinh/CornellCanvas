 In some conversations with students it seems that some people did not stop to appreciate this 5 page document.  At the top it says that it is for graders. But you all are graders. And it's really, actually, mostly for you to live by when doing homework.

 Please read it slowly some time.  And then again some time later.  Some parts of it you might not understand yet, so don't get hung up on those.
