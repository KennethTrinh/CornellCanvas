 HW 1 Problem 2

<callout type="info">
 What is your question?
</callout>
<p>
 Should we simply plug in random/well-chosen numbers for the time span and physical properties like
 <i>
  m, k, L0
 </i>
 to be able to run a numerical soln?

<p>
 Because that's what I've done so far!

  I think it's feasible to input some reasonable numbers for the variables because they are used both in the numerical and analytical solution, so they should still compare the same way with any numbers. The only difference lies in the specific values of the functions, but the shape and trend should be similar.

   If you are comparing two solutions, say numerical and analytical, you should use all of the same parameter numerical values  and initial conditions in both.
