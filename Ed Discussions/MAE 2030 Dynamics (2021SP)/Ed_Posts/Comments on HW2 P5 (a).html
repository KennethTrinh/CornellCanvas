 A lot of students in my office hours encountered the same issue: With the correct myEulerSolver function and the correct myrhs function, they got a really weird plot with the position going to negative infinity. The solution is to decrease your time interval by a lot (at least 10000 steps per second) to increase the numerical accuracy. The reason is that your initial acceleration is extremely large (~$10^6 m/s^2$), so in order to keep track of the velocity that is drastically changing over time, you need to have a very small time interval.

  Expanding a bit on what Duan Li wrote above, all of which I agree with.

  Unless you understand Duan's reasoning well, I recommend you do this little exercise.

  Consider this ODE:  $\dot x = -x$ with IC $x(0) = 1$.
  <break>
  </break>
  Draw the slope field for this ODE.
  <break>
  </break>
  Now assume that the Euler time step $h= 3$ starting with $x_1 = 1$.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  After the very first time step, you will have $$x_
  <underline>
   2 = x
  </underline>
  1 + h \dot x\vert_{
  <underline>
   x_1} = 1 + 3\times (-1) = -2.$$
  </underline>
  <break>
  </break>

  The exact mathematical solution stays positive and decays exponentially to zero. And your Euler solution goes negative at the first time step.  That is, if the time step is not small enough, Euler's method is worse than a bad approximation, it is qualitatively wrong.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  <b>
   Moral 1:
  </b>
  The ODE has a natural time scale, it's the relaxation time of the exponential.  In this example ($\dot x = -1$) that  is one time unit.  For Euler's method not to go bananas, the time step has to be smaller than the characteristic time.
 </p>
 <p>

   But it's worse than that.
  </b>
  The ODE you are solving for homework is  this (with $c&gt;0$):
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  $$\ddot x = - c x|x|$$
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  For convenience, especially for pencil and paper work, it is nicer to work with
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  $$\ddot x = - c x^2$$
 </p>
 <p>
  which is the same thing,
  <i>
   if
  </i>
  $x&gt;0$. On the other hand, if $x&lt;0$  and you use $\dot x = -c x^2$ instead of $\ddot x = -cx|x|$, then you have a bullet that is, incorrectly, being sped up by drag,  and this is faster than exponential growth, going to infinity in finite time.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  So, people doing the HW with too  big a time step first have the problem of the solution going negative at the first time step. Then that gets compounded the then shooting quickly off to infinity.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  <b>
   Moral 2:
  </b>
  If things go bad in your numerics,  simplify and break down until you can see the problem.  In ODE solutions, for example, it is good to look at the first one or two time steps and see if they look sensible.
