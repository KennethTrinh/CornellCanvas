  Things like homework and prelim exams and recitation attendance are graded so as to motivate you to try to do well at them so you will, in our estimation, have the best chance of learning more.  We could make all of those things optional and just grade the course on the final exam but most people would learn less, do worse on the final exam, and be less happy.

  That is, we are only "making" you do things for your own good.

  Towards this end,  recitations are mandatory. And that includes active participation.  Henceforth,  I have told TAs that students only get credit for attendance, online or in-person,  if they are actively engaged for the duration.

  For online people that means that when the TA drops in your breakout room, you should have cameras on, should be visibly sharing written work and should be working on the problem(s) the whole time. You don't actually have to do this, but to get credit for attendance you do.

  It's for your own good! :).  At least, it's our best guess at what is for your own good. If you are in a group of 1, also have camera on and written work in progress and showing.
