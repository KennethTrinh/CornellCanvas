  Which problem are you working on? (ex. HW 1, Problem 3, 9.1.15)
 </callout>
 <paragraph>
  HW3 Q8
 </paragraph>
 <callout type="info">
  What is your question?
 </callout>
 <paragraph>
  What is the difference between the p (for parameter) we used for Euler method and options we have this time?
 </paragraph>
 <callout type="info">
  Describe the solution attempts you've made thus far.
 </callout>
 <paragraph>
  1. The p we used was to hold parameters that need to be passed into function "myrhs" to solve for the slope. However, in the description this time there is no p as an input to the new "myEulerSolver" function, there is only a option. Should we add p as an input?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. Also what is option.maxtime exactly mean here? Does that mean we need to setup a timer inside the function, and if the run time of the script is over this maxtime, we terminate the function and print some warning?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  3. How do we solve for relative error if that is an input of function instead of output?

  <code>
   p
  </code>
  and
  <code>
   options
  </code>
  are both structs for passing information.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  <code>
   p
  </code>
  is for getting information, namely numerical constants, into your differential equation file (
  <code>
   myrhs
  </code>
  or whatever).  Initially we passed
  <code>
   p
  </code>
  through, say, ODE1, into
  <code>
   myrhs.
  </code>
  Then we changed that by using anonymous functions.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  <code>
   options
  </code>
  is for passing information into
  <code>
   ODE1
  </code>
  or
  <code>
   ODE2
  </code>
  .  It is telling the solver what to do. In our case, so far it is telling it how accurate to be,
  <code>
   options.RelTol
  </code>
  , and the maximum amount of time to try to be that accurate,
  <code>
   options.maxtime
  </code>
  .
  <break>
  </break>

  Here is a code snippet that should work for the harmonic oscillator
 </paragraph>
 <pre>tspan = ...
z0    = ...
p.k = 1;  p.m = 2;               % set parameters
options.RelTol = 1e-2;           % set desired accuracy
options.maxtime = 10;            % set maximimum amount of try for accuracy
eqn = @(t,z)   myrhs(t,z,p);     % define "anonymous" function eqn
{tarray zarray} = ODE1(eqn, tspan, z0, options);  % call the solver
</pre>

  If this isn't clear enough, please use one or two of our 40 some office hours.
