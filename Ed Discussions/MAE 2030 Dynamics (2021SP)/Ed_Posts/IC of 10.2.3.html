  Which problem are you working on? (ex. HW 1, Problem 3, 9.1.15)
 </callout>
 <paragraph>
  HW2, prblem 6, 10.2.3

 <callout type="info">
  What is your question?
 </callout>
 <paragraph>
  How should we setup initial conditions?
 </paragraph>
 <callout type="info">
  Describe the solution attempts you've made thus far.
 </callout>
 <paragraph>
  The problem only give us x and v at time equals to 2s, do we need to manually calculate what is x(t=0) and v(t=0) and put them in the code? Or can we just calculate the variables directly?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  (This problem seems to be straight forward, do we still need the Euler's method?)

  I don't think we need Euler's method? I think it's just practice for what we went over during Wednesday Lecture.

  Agree. You don't need to solve ODE for problem 6. But in boarder terms, to solve a 2nd-order ODE, we need 2 boundary conditions. The initial condition $x(0), \dot{x}(0)$ is just one form of the boundary condition. $x(2), \dot{x}(2)$ can also serve as the boundary condition - you just plug $t=2$ in and solve for the unknown constants.
