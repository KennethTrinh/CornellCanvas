  Would we expect to see coefficient of restitution on the exam? Would we also be expected to solve/ find eigenvectors or eigenvalues on the exam?

  Be prepared to answer anything covered in class thus far... although solving eigenvalues by hand is not necessarily a priority in this class. It is almost always acceptable to solve problems with MATLAB commands, especially if you demonstrate a good understanding of the meaning of the inputs and outputs of the MATLAB functions you use.

  We have not done any collisions  so far in homework nor in lecture.  While I might assume you saw collisions in freshman physics it's not something that could possibly be a big part of this exam.
