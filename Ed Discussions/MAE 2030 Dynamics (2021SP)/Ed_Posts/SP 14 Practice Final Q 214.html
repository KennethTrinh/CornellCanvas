 Can anyone explain what the omega x (omega x r) term is here? Or what the solutions have defined as the body frame in general?

  That's what the -omega^2*r*k_hat term from 2D looks like in 3D

    You should know that term since it was covered in the lecture, such as the following example from the lecture note on 4/7/21.

    Besides, the five-term formula was first taught on 4/30/21 and then the professor spent an entire lecture on 5/3/21 solving a problem in detail using this five-term formula. If you have time, you should watch these two lecture recordings or at least review the lecture notes to better understand this formula.

     In short,
    </p>
    <math>
     \vec{w}\times\left(\vec{w}\times\vec{r}_{AB}\right)=-w^2\vec{r}_{AB}
    </math>
    <p>
     You should know this term and you can think of it as the centripetal accelaration.
