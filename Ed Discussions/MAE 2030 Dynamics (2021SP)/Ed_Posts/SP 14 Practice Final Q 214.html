  In short,
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  \vec{w}\times\left(\vec{w}\times\vec{r}_{AB}\right)=-w^2\vec{r}_{AB}
 </math>

  You should know this term and you can think of it as the centripetal accelaration.

  You should know that term since it was covered in the lecture, such as the following example from the lecture note on 4/7/21.

  Besides, the five-term formula was first taught on 4/30/21 and then the professor spent an entire lecture on 5/3/21 solving a problem in detail using this five-term formula. If you have time, you should watch these two lecture recordings or at least review the lecture notes to better understand this formula.
