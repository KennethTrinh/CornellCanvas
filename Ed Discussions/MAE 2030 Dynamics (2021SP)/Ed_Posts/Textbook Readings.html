 Is there a specific schedule you recommend we follow as far as reading the textbook. I would like to plan out how I'm gonna break up the chapters into chunks so it's more manageable.

  I would look at the total amount to be done in about 4 weeks to make a quantity budget.  Then I would read in the order that matches your interests or needs.  For example, start with reading things related to homework, and branch out from there.

  How you budget depends on your starting confidence and competence with free body diagrams, vectors, statics equations and ODEs.  If you have A+ understanding of all of the pre-req course material, then you have much less reading to do.
