 Which problem are you working on? (ex. HW 1, Problem 3, 9.1.15)
</callout>
<p>
 9: 10.2.10
</p>
<callout type="info">
 What is your question?
</callout>
<p>
 For part d, should we plug in numbers or leave it symbolic? The wording, "Answer in symbols, numbers and numbers of body weight (i.e., find F = mg)," confuses me.

 Describe the solution attempts you've made thus far.

<p>
 I've solved the whole problem except for plugging in those numbers.

  You are intended to answer 3 ways:
 </p>
 <p>
  a) symbols
 </p>
 <p>
  b) numbers times units (substitute in values for the variables)
 </p>
 <p>
  c) number of body weights.  That's $F/mg$.  Your rendition is missing the $/$.  Maybe a pdf issue with your computer?

  This gives a sense of what her legs are doing compared to just standing around.  In this case, I think that number is too big, and that the premise of the problem is false. I don't think she could supply the needed force.   But it's hard tell that without numbers like this.

    but it's always good to plug in numbers to see a numerical answer as a sanity check
