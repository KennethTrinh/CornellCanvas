  Hi -
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  When looking at the grading scheme, I noticed that HW only counts as 1 "number" out of 25, while exams count for the other 14. I understand that exams usually are weighted more heavily than homework, but the homework for this class takes an extensive amount of time each week, and it doesn't quite make sense that our homework from the entire semester only count as 1/15 (or less) of our grade. Could the weighting for the homework possibly be increased?

  Thanks!

  Alison,  I'll write more later, but first read
  <link href="https://canvas.cornell.edu/courses/1402/pages/grading-philosophy"/>
  my little essay about grading, if you have not already.

  The main issues with your idea are:

   <paragraph>
    changing the rules midcourse (which I would do if I thought it was a good idea, and all students agreed);
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    How much grades are supposed to be about effort and how much about your knowledge.
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>

  At present, my main view about giving homework grades at all is that homework grades are a motivator.  Mostly though, you should do the HW to learn.  And you should do it well to learn better.  And if you know a better way to learn, you can still get a good grade (up to A+)  in this course without doing any homework.
