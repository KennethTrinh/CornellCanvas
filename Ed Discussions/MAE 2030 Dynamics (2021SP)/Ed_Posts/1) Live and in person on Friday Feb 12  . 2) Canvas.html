   In person on Friday.
  </bold>
  For those coming in person,  we are trying again to be live  and in person on Friday Feb 12 at 1:30 in Thurston 203 . Please come and settle in at least 5 minutes early (to this and every live lecture). Please sit in the marked seats (there should be 9 free) and in any case make sure that the nearest person is at least 6 feet away.

  For those online, you, because there are 15 times as many of you, are most important. We want to optimize for you. So, comments about what is working, and what is not working, and ideas for improvement are welcome.

  for this course is still a bit chaotic. We hope to make it easier to digest, with fewer redundancies, contradictions, and blind alleys, in the coming days.
