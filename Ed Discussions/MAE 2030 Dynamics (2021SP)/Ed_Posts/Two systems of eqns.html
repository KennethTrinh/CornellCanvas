 Which problem are you working on? (ex. HW 1, Problem 3, 9.1.15)

<p>
 HW 3, Problem 13, 10.4.14

<callout type="info">
 What is your question?
</callout>
<p>
 Should part a) (our governing equations) be in terms of both $x_1$ and $x_2$? And therefore have two sets of 1st order systems of equations?

 Describe the solution attempts you've made thus far.

 That's what I've done so far! The diagram is labeled to imply this set up/we did that in lecture, but just wanted to make sure.

  First, try to make it work-it sounds like you are close.  You absolutely have all the tools to solve this problem and are on the right track.  This problem is about understanding how you can use the framework you have created (rhs functions and euler solvers) to solve problems involving multiple points/objects.  Think about how with one point you are still solving two related first-order ODEs and extend

   Okay, just to clarify: we're solving this numerically (in terms of $x_1$)?

    solving numerically? yes.  It should be in terms of the initial conditions ( x_1 is one of these but not the only one)

     Oh hm. Do you mean we should be using the matrix form of the ODE? Or just that there's another initial condition that we need to modify to be in terms of $x_1$?
