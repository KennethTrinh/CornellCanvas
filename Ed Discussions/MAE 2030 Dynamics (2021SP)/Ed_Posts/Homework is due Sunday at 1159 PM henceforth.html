  From now on, starting this week (actually, last week), homework is due Sunday at midnight.

  A vote shows unambiguously that Sunday is the most pleasing due day for MAE 2030 homework.

  TA Marigot took a poll. 88 students voted. They ranked their choices for the best day for HW to be due. I had hoped the vote would be close so I could write a Matlab script, using the ranked data, to do "majority rule voting", running pairwise elections between all 21 pairs of days.  However, this was not needed.

  Here is the tabulation in simplest terms.
  <break>
  </break>
  49/88  = 56%
  <bold>
   Sunday
  </bold>
  was their first choice
  <break>
  </break>
  14/88  = 16%
  <bold>
   Saturday
  </bold>
  <break>
  </break>
  8/88  =   9%
  <bold>
   Monday
  </bold>
  <break>
  </break>
  7/88  =   8%
  <bold>
   Friday
  </bold>
  <break>
  </break>
  5/88  =   6%
  <bold>
   Thursday
  </bold>
  <break>
  </break>
  4/88  =   5%
  <bold>
   Tuesday
  </bold>
  <break>
  </break>
  1/88  =   1%
  <bold>
   Monday

  Because more than half of the students picked Sunday as their first choice, Sunday did not just have a plurality, but a majority. Therefor, Sunday wins in a pairwise vote against any other day. For example, in a vote of Sunday vs Saturday, the vote is 68:20 in favor of Sunday.  And for all the other possible alternatives to Sunday, besides Saturday, the vote is less close.

  80   students of 88,  that's 91%,  had Sunday as one of their 4 most preferred days; only 8 students ranked Sunday as worse than average (fifth, sixth or 7th choice).
  <break>
  </break>

  Sunday maximizes the number of people that get what they want, and minimize's the number of people who are unhappy.
