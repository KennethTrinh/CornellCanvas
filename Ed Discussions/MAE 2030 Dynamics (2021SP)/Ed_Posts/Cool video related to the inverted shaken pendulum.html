  Per Professor Ruina's request I'm sharing a cool video I saw a while ago essentially about an liquid inverted shaken pendulum.

  The presenter explains both the concepts of this "liquid pendulum" and goes back to the inverted shaken pendulum we looked at in class today as a point of comparison.

  I feel he explains the ideas well and fairly intuitively.
