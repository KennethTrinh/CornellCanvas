 Hi folks,
</p>
<p>
 You should have gotten an email sometime recently from the College of Engineering to provide feedback on the 2030 TAs. You can access this survey at
 <a href="http://www.engineering.cornell.edu/TAEval/survey.cfm">
  http://www.engineering.cornell.edu/TAEval/survey.cfm
 </a>
 until March 29th (the Monday after the next) at 5:00 PM.
</p>
<p>
 As a quick tip, positive feedback is most helpful when it makes one of us say "Oh, I should keep doing this particular thing that the students liked", and negative feedback is most helpful when it's constructive, i.e. when it points out something where we can say "Hmm, I/We should be doing this particular thing better". General positive feedback also makes us TAs very happy, so feel free to show us some love if you feel generally happy/satisfied with our work. (I am, of course, biased).
</p>
<p>
 Thanks in advance for your feedback, everyone!

  There was an issue for a section of the class so if you didn't see the 2030 TAs before you should check again because it got fixed.
