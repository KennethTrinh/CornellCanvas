  For this course, all prelims and the final exam are inclusive, possibly covering any material from this course, or its prerequisites, up through any homework handed in by the time of the test and any lectures given by the time of the test.

  If you are taking online, you need a zoom camera at a distance of about 5 feet from you that shows you, your work area, and the front of your screen. Log on to the course recitation zoom link (from Canvas).  Your work area needs to be clean and simple looking.

  At the end of the test, from home or in person, you will make a single  multi-page pdf scan of your test.  Not jpg. Not single pages. Practice this ahead of time.  If you are doing this from home, switch your zoom camera to being your computer camera showing you scanning your exam.

  When I go to print the exam, I have to move my computer across my room. That requires me to unplug it from my monitor, which is where my webcam plugs in. As such, my video will have to turn off while the exam is printing.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Last time, I hadn't realized this (so I accidentally left my video off for longer than it took to print and return to my desk). I'll remember to turn video back on this time, but I don't think I can work around the 30-ish second video lapse.

  I know this isn't ideal, but is it okay?

  As long as it's ~30 seconds this time, that should be okay

  If explained to the proctor it's ok. Also, you don't need to print the exam, most people did not.
