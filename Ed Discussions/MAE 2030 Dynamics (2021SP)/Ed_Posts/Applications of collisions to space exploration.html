 For those of you who have worked on the discussion problem already, there's a particularly interesting application of these equations to space explorationâ€”there's a maneuver called a "gravity assist" that spaceships use to get from place to place, which is governed by the same physical principles as the collision problem you dealt/will deal with in discussion. (This is also the "slingshot" maneuver around the black hole that happens near the end of Interstellar.)

<p>
 Take a look at the derivation

 , and see if you can't frame it as a collision problem. In particular, see if the limit they present there for the spaceship speed post-assist is similar to the limit you find in the discussion problem.

  The 2D collisional homework this week (due March 20) is more relevant to this example than the previous 1D collisional HW.
