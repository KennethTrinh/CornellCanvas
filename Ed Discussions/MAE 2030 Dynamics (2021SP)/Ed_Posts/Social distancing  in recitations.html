 To MAE 2030 students and TAs;
</p>
<p>
 Soon after one of the  MAE 2030 in-person recitations last week (March 15-19) one person was tested positive for Covid.

 In that section the students were not all following 6' spacing policies. I think it might even be that all were not.  I don't know how common or uncommon such disallowed distancing happens in recitations and such.  In this case the consequences are these: the whole recitation group and the TA are now in quarantine.

 Upson 102 has space for 10 individual students to work on white boards at one time while keeping social distancing (3 on each side of the room, 3 at the front, one sitting at the low board at the back).   In sections with 11 or 12 students there needs to be one or two students teamed with one other individual. Those one or two should keep back 6 ft from the person working at the board. As you may recall, we moved recitations to room 142 from a different Upson room at the start of the semester; it was because of this extra Covid-distance-manageable board room in Upson 142 that we moved.

 There are Covid-acceptable variations on the grouping and spacing I describe above.  Besides that you must maintain the 6 ft distancing, you can use other groupings if you think that those other groupings increase your engagement.
</p>
<p>
 The goals are:
</p>
<p>
 1) Covid safety;
</p>
<p>
 2) Maximize your engagement (this is not the same as maximizing the number of problems you can get right).

 Please post questions and comments below.
