  Hi folks,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Next week, I was thinking of switching my usual Tuesday office hours to a time that's optimally the most beneficial for all of you who are preparing for the exam next Thursday. To that end, I've created a quick "poll" where those of you who are interested in having office hours at specific times can fill in whatever times you're most interested in. I can't promise I'll be able to do the most popular options, but I'll definitely try.

  Here's the link to the poll. If you have any trouble filling it in, let me know.

  Hope this is helpful!
