 Here is the first homework assignment. Please ask for clarifications below.
</p>
<p>
 (Updated on 3/10.21 to correct problem 3. It now says explicitly, as was previously intended,  that $\theta$ is given. )

  Is the README file suppose to be inside the matlab code or a different txt file that explains how to run the code?

   A separate txt file. (But the code itself should also contain comments. Will seem less redundant once you submit homeworks with many .m files.) ü•®
  </p>
  <p>
   Andy adds: If there is only one .m file, then having that one file well commented is sufficient and there is no need for a *README file.

   Are we required to use MatLab for question 2 (especially where an Excel spreadsheet is functionally identical and more efficient)?

    I don't agree with your premise!  Matlab, please.  I think you will come to change your mind with time.

    Caveat. Presumably both Excel and Matlab are 'Turing' machines and are thus functionally equivalent.  But, at that level, so is  some processors Assembly language.  These are all equivalent in what they can do, but not in the effort it takes to do them.

    I would be curious when that time comes, that you find Matlab works better.  I am not an Excel user, so don't know its real limits.  For this problem could you do 100 million time steps in Excel?

    The homework instructions say we need to include a readme file. Do we need that for this assignment (I commented at the top of my code what it is)? If so, what exactly should that look like?

     The README file can be as simple as a notepad file with clear instructions on how to run your submitted code to get the data/plots you report on your PDF.
    </p>
    <p>
     For example; if you only submit one plot in your homework and all you have to do to generate that plot is press "Run" on the script editor, then your README can just consist of something along the lines of "Run the included code to generate the plot reported in Page XX of the PDF". For more complex stuff, like two plots generated with distinct chunks of code, write appropriate, more complex instructions‚Äîyou get the idea.

      If you only have one Matlab file that is well commented you do not need a README file.

     For question 3 are we allowed to solve it in terms of theta?

      I am wondering what should we use to solve Question 2 and make the plots? Should we do it on a piece of paper or should we use Matlab (without using ODE45 or other functions)?

       Use Matlab. You can use various Matlab functions, just not one of the ODE solvers.

       Since in the book chapter 3.1, there are exsiting general solutions of homogenous ODEs. Can we directly write down the solution equation in our hw for problem 1?

        It is OK to just 'know' the solutions of these equations:  first and second order, linear, constant-coeficient, homogeneous.   You should know how to check that they are indeed solutions so you can know if what you remember is right or wrong.

        In a different post, a student asked about Springs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Read about springs in the text in Chapter 7.1
