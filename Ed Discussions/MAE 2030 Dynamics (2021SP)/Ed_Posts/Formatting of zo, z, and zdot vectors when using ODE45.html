 Which problem are you working on? (ex. HW 1, Problem 3, 9.1.15)
</callout>
<p>
 Question 16, 11.3.7
</p>
<callout type="info">
 What is your question?
</callout>
<p>
 The inputs for ODE45 include a vector with initial conditions (zo) and an equation that outputs a vector containing the instantaneous rates of change of relevant state variables at any moment in time (zdot). When these vectors contain information for multiple bodies (like in question 16, where 3 bodies are being analyzed), how should the vectors be formatted?
</p>
<p>
 [x1 x2 x3 v1 v2 v3]'?
</p>
<p>
 [x1 v1 x2 v2 x3 v3]'?
</p>
<p>
 Or something else?
</p>
<p>
 Or does the format not matter, so long as the columns in zo and z correspond correctly with the columns in zdot.
</p>
<p>
 Meaning z could be [x1 x2 x3 v1 v2 v3]' if zdot were [v1 v2 v3 a1 a2 a3]'.
</p>
<p>
 Or z could be [x1 v1 x2 v2 x3 v3]' if zdot were [v1 a1 v2 a2 v3 a3]'.

  All positions then all velocities. Itâ€™s not a rule but it often makes coding of the rhs file cleaner.
