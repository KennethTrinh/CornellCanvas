  One for each week, or partial week, of classes.  That is, all of the lectures (with the exception of the walking robot lecture) and all of the related readings are potentially on the Final exam.  And, I like to be able to say that if you can do all of the homework (by yourself without looking anything up) you will do well on the exam.  So we need some homework associated with the last few lectures.

  generally when a homework's due date is pushed back it does not affect the following homework (they are independent; what matters is the time between when a homework is assigned and when it is due)
