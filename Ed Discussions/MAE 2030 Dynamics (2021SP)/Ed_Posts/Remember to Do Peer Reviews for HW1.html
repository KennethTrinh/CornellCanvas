  To fill out the rubric when peer reviewing there is a category asking if they have completed their peer reviews. Should we just give full credit for that part assuming they will do them?

   The rubric is for the Staff graders to fill out, it is just listed for you on Canvas so that you know what they are basing their grading on. You should focus on the "Guidelines for peer reviewing" under
   <b>
    Peer Review Directions
   </b>
   . If you nail everything listed there, you will receive full credit every time.

    It says that as a peer reviewer we need to leave comments and fill out the rubric to get credit/finish the peer reviewing so I'm still confused.

     I am not sure where it says to fill out the rubric as part of the review process. It does mention the rubric but only to point out that you can see that doing peer reviews is 10 points of your homework grade.

      On canvas it says this, I've attached a picture where is says that we need to fill out the rubric. I know that it doesn't say in the peer review directions I think we're just confused about the differing messages.

       I see what you mean now, it's not the directions but when you are viewing the student's assignment. Thank you for this picture.

       It appears that Canvas automatically shows you the rubric that the graders use and then requires you to fill it out, which we did not plan and unfortunately Canvas will not let us change (thanks, Canvas!).
      </p>

       You can fill out the rubric as if you were the grader and just fill in 10/10 for the peer review part. The graders will not use your rubric to grade the student's work, nor will they base their evaluation of your peer review on you filling out the rubric.

         Hi, I was going over my HW2, and I noticed that I got a zero in the peer review section. I was under the impression that I did not need to fill out the rubric, so long as I submitted comments for the student (which is all I did). Just for future reference, do I need to fill out the rubric in order to get full credit?

          Hi Gabriela, super sorry about this! The peer review system we had apparently marked it as incomplete, although I do see your comments. I'll give you full credit for this homework but as per the guidelines, please mark up the pdfs instead of only adding comments (both is great!). Sorry again and I'll get it changed ASAP!
         </p>
         <p>
          As for filling out the rubric, that's not required but you can use it to help you :)
