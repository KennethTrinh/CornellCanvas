  On p. 877, there is an example that shows that, for a wheel rolling on level ground in the absence of air resistance, etc., the rotation rate of the wheel must be constant. I understand how this was derived, but the end result doesn't make sense to me, since we know from rolling kinematics that the CoM velocity is directly related to the rotation rate. From doing LMB on the force diagram in Figure 17.49, I would expect the velocity of the CoM to decrease over time because of the friction force (and thus the rotation rate would decrease). How do you reconcile this?

  For a perfectly circular wheel rolling without slip on level ground in the absence of air resistance, there isn't any friction force/rolling resistance for precisely the reason you mention (the wheel would eventually stop moving, which would make it stop rotating, which contradicts the angular momentum balance).

  Note that, for this scenario, you can generate the rolling without slip condition without any frictional forces by simply requiring the (constant) rotation rate to be related to the (constant) velocity of the center of mass in such a way that the velocity of the contact point is zero, which is what the example does.

  Ok, that makes sense. Thank you!
