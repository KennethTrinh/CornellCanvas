 1. I looked at the other post where a TA addressed that we should only fill out the peer review section in the rubric to 10/10. Is that the case?
</p>
<p>
 2. For the comments that we are making to others, should we just put into comments tab on canvas or should we attach a seperate file? (Like should we attach a pdf with our written comments on other's hw pdf? That could be messy for the graders.)

  You should mark up their pdf in the Canvas window and leave other comments in the comment tab
