 Would it be possible to make a rough grade boundary estimate based on how we did on prelims so we can make a more educated decision as to whether we should drop or not because just knowing that we aren't in danger of failing isn't enough reason for me to stay in the class (personally) since I've already learned the material and don't need it on my transcript? I've also spoken to a few of my classmates and they are also wondering about their standing in this class.

  The median student will get either a B or B+.

  Any honest participant will get at least a C-.

  People who stay to the end, trying to do well on the final, will learn more than people who stop before the end.

  Talk with me in office hours if you need more nuance than this.
