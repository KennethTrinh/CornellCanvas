  If you take the sum of moments about the COM, is it always equal to 0? By the definitions we've been given for AMB, you can set the sum of moments = cross(R_G/c, ma) where c is any fixed point. Therefore, if C=G, R_G/G = O and the sum of moments is 0 right? I know this is simple, but I want to make sure I'm not mixing something up.

  It is zero for a non-rotating rigid object.   Generally not so otherwise.
