 Which problem are you working on? (ex. HW 1, Problem 3, 9.1.15)

 What is your question?
</callout>
<p>
 I have two prelims on Thursday and a 36 hr hackathon starting that Friday night so I'm not sure how I will possibly have the time to complete the HW 4 by Saturday night. Is there any way I could have an extension for this HW or are we allowed any drops? All of the prelims for this class overlap with all of my prelims for genetics (BIOMG 2800) so I also know that I will continue to struggle with the post prelim Saturday due dates... If it is possible to shift the due dates for post prelim HWs to Sunday or Monday I would greatly appreciate it.

  Sure, we can give an extra day when the homework is due near a prelim. I moved the due date of HW4 back to Sunday night instead of Saturday night.

   about late HW.  If he is not accommodating, then you can use it as one of your dropped HW grades.

   We'll discuss HW due dates for next week at our next staff meeting.

   I don't really care when it is due, myself. But I don't want it to crowd the next HW.
