  On the midsemester evaluation at least one person complained that handing in homework takes too much time.

  I think it would be slightly easier if we could just turn in a zip file of our matlab code instead of a zip file AND the published code. This way we wouldn't have to merge the pdfs of our written work and code, so it wouldn't be as tedious.

  In order to help solve this problem I've been doing some of my work in .mlx files (where you can insert code and standalone paragraph-long comments)--this was helpful for the 2d collision MATLAB problem because most of my work was in MATLAB and I was just describing the expected behavior for my testcases.

  Building off of what James said: is it okay to write "see problem3.m for code" in the middle of my work and then paste in the image output if that's all that's appropriate to solving the problem?

  This is fine so long as the written part stands on its own.  Graders, what do you think?
