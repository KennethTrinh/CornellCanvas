  Hi all:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  As you can tell, we will encounter many differential equations in the class. I would strongly suggest having the cheat sheet that you brought to the final exam with you since it's probably a condensed version of how to solve all types of equations in that class, and is way faster than flipping through pages of class notes. The same thing applies to all the prerequisites for whichever class you are/will be taking, but I think 2930 is especially useful for this class (and many other classes to come). Feel free to refer to mine if it helps, but I don't know if it's readable for anyone else and it's always best to organize it to your preference.

  Also, if you ever get stuck on that in discussion sections, please feel free to ask us!

  Some things from Teaya's magnificent ODE cheat sheet that we will not use in this class at all:  PDEs (Laplace, wave, heat), Laplace transform, and Fourier series.
