 I was wondering if the data for assignment 3 could be uploaded.

 Also would it be possible to post the data for the 1D layout problem as a csv for gurobipy users, or is there an easy way to convert from AMPL dat files to something you can read into Python?

  I uploaded them to Canvas. You can find them under Lecture 7 --- 15.csv and 15ell.csv.
