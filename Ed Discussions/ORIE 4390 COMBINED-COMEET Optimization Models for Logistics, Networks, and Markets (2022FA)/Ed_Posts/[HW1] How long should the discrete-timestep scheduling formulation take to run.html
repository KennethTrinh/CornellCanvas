 I know that it will take longer than the continuous-time formulation, but it's taking a really long time for me. I added one new variable of cardinality $N$ and $N$ new constraints on that variable, and for some reason it's already taken an additional 2 hours (and still isn't done) while last time it took at most like 5 minutes. It's stuck at the
 <code>
  PPush
 </code>
 stage, described here in more depth:

 I don't anticipate that this will finish before 4 or so hours. But we were supposed to try out both formulations, and I can't use my (faster) desktop since it's not within range of eduroam so I can't get Gurobi running on it. Any advice?

  What exactly are you trying to solve (and why)?

   Originally I was going to give both formulations so I could compare them, but after around 6 hours of running the discrete-time one I decided against using it as a comparison point. I'll just stick to the continuous-time formulation and submit that.
