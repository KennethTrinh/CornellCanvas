 I don't understand how to plot x1 and x2 and their logs without knowing anything about them besides their range. Are they linear or exponential, or something else? I understand that the "wiggle" thing in part e) is supposed to be a hint, but I'm having trouble parsing what that means. Thank you.

  Hi,
 </p>
 <p>
  Yes, the "wiggle" is the key clue.  You know the range of x1 and of x2.  You could start by drawing dotted horizontal lines on the graph that show the minimum and maximum values of x1 and x2, determined by their ranges.
 </p>
 <p>
  I don't tell you anything about what kind of function of time x1 and x2 are, so you're right, there's no particular "right answer" for the shape of the curve.  All you know is that it doesn't go outside the range.  So you can draw any "wiggle" or curve you want, as long as it's within that range...
