 For question #7, I assumed the temperature inside the instrument to be the room temperature (20c) because it didn't mention in the question. So I calculated frequency using 340m/s which is speed of sound for normal room temperature. However, on the answer key, it says the temperature inside the instrument is 30 degree. How do I get that number?

  30 degrees C is a better guess. You're blowing into the instrument and heating it up, so if you're in 20 C room, the air inside is warmer - maybe 30 C.  But that's just a guess. Use a value somewhere between room T and body T.  30 C is just a guess.
