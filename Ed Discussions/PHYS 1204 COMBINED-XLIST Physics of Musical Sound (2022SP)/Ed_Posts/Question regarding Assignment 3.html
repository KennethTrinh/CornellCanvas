  As we showed in lecture friday with the guitar, there are (at least) two ways to press on the string.  You can press down hard, so that your finger blocks all energy flow from the plucked/bowed part of the string to the part between the nut and your finger. You can also touch the string very lightly with your finger, preventing large amplitude motion there, but still allowing energy to propagate past your finger and create standing waves on the whole length of the string.   Those standing waves can't have a maximum near your finger, so only certain n values can be excited.

   It would help if you explain your thinking, so I know where you're coming from. The basic idea is that playing different notes on a guitar amounts to pressing your fingers down on the string making the portion that vibrates shorter. The effective length of the string lessens, and this raises the frequency of the fundamental mode. If you know the frequency of the open string fundamental and you know by how much the length is shortened to get to the new note, then you should be able to calculate the new frequency.
