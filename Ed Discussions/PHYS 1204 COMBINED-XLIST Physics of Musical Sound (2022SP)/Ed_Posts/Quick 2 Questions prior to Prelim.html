  Hi unfortunately I can't make the last office hours with Greg scheduled for today before the prelim due to a time conflict.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I am just a little confused on two things.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1. The difference between an even and a just temperament scale. Should I focus on this for the next prelim?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. How to decompose a sawtooth, triangle, and square wave.
