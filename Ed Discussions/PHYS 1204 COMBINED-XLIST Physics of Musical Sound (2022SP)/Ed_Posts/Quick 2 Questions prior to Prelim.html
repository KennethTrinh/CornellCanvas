 Hi unfortunately I can't make the last office hours with Greg scheduled for today before the prelim due to a time conflict.
</p>
<p>
 I am just a little confused on two things.
</p>
<p>
 1. The difference between an even and a just temperament scale. Should I focus on this for the next prelim?
</p>
<p>
 2. How to decompose a sawtooth, triangle, and square wave.
</p>
<p>
 Thank you for your time.
