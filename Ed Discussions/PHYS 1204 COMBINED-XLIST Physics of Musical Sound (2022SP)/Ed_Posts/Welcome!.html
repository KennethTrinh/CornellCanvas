 Hi everyone,
</p>
<p>
 We're using Ed Discussion for class Q&amp;A.  This is the first time we're using it, so please be patient as it make take a week or two for us to learn the ins  and outs.
</p>
<p>
 This is (or will be...) the best place to ask questions about the course, whether curricular or administrative. You will get faster answers here from staff and peers than through email.
</p>
<p>
 Here are some tips:
</p>
<list style="bullet">
 <li>
  <p>
   Search before you post
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Heart questions and answers you find useful
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Answer questions you feel confident answering
  </p>
 </li>
