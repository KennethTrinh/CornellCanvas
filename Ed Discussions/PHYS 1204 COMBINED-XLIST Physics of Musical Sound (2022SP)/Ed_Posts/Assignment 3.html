  So try to think about what the wavelength of the sound wave is. After that, ask yourself how far along the wave starting at the mouthpiece do you have to go to hit a node in the pressure in terms of that wavelength?

   For part d), you have to think about the difference in the frequency spectrum and pressure patterns the harmonics make depending on the type of instrument. This may have not yet been covered in lecture. Perhaps it was covered today. The flute and clarinet behave quite differently.
