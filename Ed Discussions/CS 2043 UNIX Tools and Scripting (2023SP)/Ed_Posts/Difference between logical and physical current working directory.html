 I was wondering what the difference between the logical and physical current working directory was and which scenarios we would use one over the other.

  !     I kind of glossed over the differences in lecture that day because we have a more detailed lecture on the file system in a couple of weeks :-)

   I can show you the difference. I created a test folder called
   <code>
    test
   </code>
   , located in
   <code>
    ~/test/
   </code>
   , I then create a symbolic link in my home directory to my
   <code>
    test
   </code>
   folder called
   <code>
    asdf
   </code>
   , it is also located in
   <code>
    ~/asdf
   </code>
   . Let's change our directory to follow the symbolic link:
  </p>
  <p>
   <code>
    cd ~/asdf
   </code>
  </p>
  <p>
   If you do
   <code>
    pwd -L
   </code>
   , it shows us
   <code>
    /home/[username]/asdf
   </code>
   , this is our "logical" working directory.
  </p>
  <p>
   If you do
   <code>
    pwd -P
   </code>
   it shows us
   <code>
    /home/[username]/test
   </code>
   , this is our "physical" working directory, because this is the actual directory we are working in after you remove the symbolic link that links
   <code>
    asdf -&gt; test
   </code>
  </p>
  <p>
   I recommend you try this yourself (In your VM with a test directory) so you can see this for yourself.
