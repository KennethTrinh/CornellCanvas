  I was wondering what the difference between the logical and physical current working directory was and which scenarios we would use one over the other.

  I can show you the difference. I created a test folder called
  <code>
   test
  </code>
  , located in
  <code>
   ~/test/
  </code>
  , I then create a symbolic link in my home directory to my
  <code>
   test
  </code>
  folder called
  <code>
   asdf
  </code>
  , it is also located in
  <code>
   ~/asdf
  </code>
  . Let's change our directory to follow the symbolic link:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <code>
   cd ~/asdf
  </code>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If you do
  <code>
   pwd -L
  </code>
  , it shows us
  <code>
   /home/[username]/asdf
  </code>
  , this is our "logical" working directory.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If you do
  <code>
   pwd -P
  </code>
  it shows us
  <code>
   /home/[username]/test
  </code>
  , this is our "physical" working directory, because this is the actual directory we are working in after you remove the symbolic link that links
  <code>
   asdf -&gt; test
  </code>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I recommend you try this yourself (In your VM with a test directory) so you can see this for yourself.

  !     I kind of glossed over the differences in lecture that day because we have a more detailed lecture on the file system in a couple of weeks :-)
