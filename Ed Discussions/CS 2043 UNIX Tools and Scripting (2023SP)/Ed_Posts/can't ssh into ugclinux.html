  I can't get into ssh on cornell wifi or on the cu vpn. Every time I try, I enter my password and get the message "permission denied, please try again." I thought I might be using the wrong password by accident, so I changed my NetID password and have continued trying to get in but I get the same message each time.

  That's the behavior you get when you do not have an account set up on ugclinux.

  If you aren't already a CS major, getting access may take a few days after you enroll in the course.     Did you add the course late or have you been enrolled since the first day of classes?    Email me directly and I can look into whether or not you have an account there.   I can't provision accounts, but I can submit a ticket to the CS IT dept to try to get you added sooner!
