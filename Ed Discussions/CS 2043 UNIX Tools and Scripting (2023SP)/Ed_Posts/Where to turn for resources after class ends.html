  Hey,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I really liked this course and found it very useful and practical. What are some resources or things I can do to learn more about commands, bash scripting, and UNIX based systems after the class ends given that there are many things we didn't cover.

  There were a number of links in the slide decks in various lectures that provided more information.   Some of them were just more in-depth references.   If you looked at all of the downloadable content for the course some of the added material (that was in the .zip files but which I didn't cover in lecture) provided some exercises you could do to get more practice with certain commands and concepts.

  Aside from that there are a number of books you could turn to for more in depth discussions on shell scripting;  I don't have a particular one I recommend

  If you wanted to take a deeper dive into various tools we use (git, awk, sed, etc.) you will probably be able to find books and resources online that focus on those areas as well.

  If you find a particular resource that you really like, please feel free to share with me and I'll include a reference to it to the class!
