 Hey,
</p>
<p>
 I really liked this course and found it very useful and practical. What are some resources or things I can do to learn more about commands, bash scripting, and UNIX based systems after the class ends given that there are many things we didn't cover.

  There were a number of links in the slide decks in various lectures that provided more information.   Some of them were just more in-depth references.   If you looked at all of the downloadable content for the course some of the added material (that was in the .zip files but which I didn't cover in lecture) provided some exercises you could do to get more practice with certain commands and concepts.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aside from that there are a number of books you could turn to for more in depth discussions on shell scripting;  I don't have a particular one I recommend
 </p>
 <p>
  If you wanted to take a deeper dive into various tools we use (git, awk, sed, etc.) you will probably be able to find books and resources online that focus on those areas as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you find a particular resource that you really like, please feel free to share with me and I'll include a reference to it to the class!
