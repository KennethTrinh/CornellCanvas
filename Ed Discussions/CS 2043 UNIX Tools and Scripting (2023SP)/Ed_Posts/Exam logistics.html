 What would be the format for the exam? Are we required to memorize all the commands?

  It's 15 short answer questions.   I'll post a practice exam sometime tomorrow (Sunday).   You won't need to memorize all of the commands and we'll have a review session in class the Monday before the exam to go through what you should focus on when preparing for the exam.
