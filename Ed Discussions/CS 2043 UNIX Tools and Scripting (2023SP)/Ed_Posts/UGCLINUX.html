  TL DR; I am having a lot of trouble installing the virtual environment. Is UGCLINUX an okay option?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I've been trying to get this installation of ubuntu and the virtual environment to work for the past 5 hours to no luck. There is no free option of VMware that works with my laptop, but I tried getting the 30 day free trial of a version that did anyway. Then when I tried to install Ubuntu on this virtual environment, I get an error that apparently many others have too.

  I couldn't follow the resolution the above link describes. But, it seems that I would need to install the most recent version of VMware on my laptop to resolve it.... Which is not an option because my older laptop can't support newer releases of VMware.

  What are the benefits or downsides of using UGCLINUX? Would this be an ok option. At this point I feel like I am not going to be able to successfully install ubuntu on a virtual envirnoment on my machine unless someone holds my hand through the process step by step.

  If you want to discuss the issues you are having with installing VMWare at some point we can either schedule time or you can come to office hours.
