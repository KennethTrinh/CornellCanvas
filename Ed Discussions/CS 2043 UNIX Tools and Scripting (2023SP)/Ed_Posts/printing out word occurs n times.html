  Is there some specific format you're looking for, for the print statements? (For example, capitalization, a space, etc).

  OR can we just echo something like "the word [word] occurs [n] times"

  I noticed just printing "[word] occurs n times" makes it difficult to read because you can't tell what the word is.

  The above answer is fine.   The word does not need to be in quotes, but it probably looks better if you do put it in quotes!
