 Would really like to be able to re-watch parts of lecture, like the demos.

  Historically, I have not recorded lectures with the exception of Spring 2021 when this course was fully remote due to COVID.

  It's something I can look into but I wouldn't expect it to happen immediately!

   Thanks for the info! Would really appreciate it if they could be recorded, but I also understand that it would take extra work.
