 I wrote up the script for #8 on the practice prelim, and I ran it and I got 4 7 7, which seems to be the length of the word + 1. I was wondering why this happens.

  I believe this is because the
  <code>
   wc -m
  </code>
  command counts the newline
  <code>
   \n
  </code>
  character at the end of each line, while the
  <code>
   ${#var}
  </code>
  notation does not.

   Just a quick note.   Since the fact that the newline is included with wc -m is not generally known and was not mentioned in class, I would have taken either answer (either 3,6,6 or 4,7,7).  That question was more testing that  you knew the additional read statement would consume another line of input.
