  Just to make sure, when encountering a file that doesn't exist, we always output "wordCount.sh: noSuchFile: Not a file", regardless of the name of the argument?

  No, instead of printing "noSuchFile" you are supposed to print out the name of the file that doesn't  exist.   It just so happens that in the assignment description I demonstrated this by using "noSuchFile" as an example of a file name that didn't exist.

  To clarify, here are some examples of what should come out:
 </paragraph>
 <pre>
$ ./wordCount.sh abcdef
wordCount.sh: abcdef: Not a file

$./wordCount.sh coffee
wordCount.sh: coffee: Not a file

</pre>
 <paragraph>
  <break>
  </break>
  Does that make it clearer?
