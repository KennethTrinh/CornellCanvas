  After I touch a2.sh and try to run it with
  <code>
   ./a2.sh
  </code>
  , it says
  <code>
   Permission denied
  </code>
  . But I can run the script using
  <code>
   bash a2.sh
  </code>
  as we learned in class. Do I need to update the permission for the a2.sh script file, or is it wrong to create a2.sh with the touch command?

  Yes, you should update the permission by
  <code>
   chmod +x a2.sh
  </code>
  after writing a file with
  <code>
   touch
  </code>
  to add executable permission to it.

  You can also check the current permission by
  <code>
   ls -la
  </code>
  ing in the directory that has the file.
