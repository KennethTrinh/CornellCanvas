 I was following the tutorial but it appears that I cannot press the X button and the finish button doesn't appear for the VMWare player so I'm unable to access it. I'm not sure what's causing this. Is there a work around/solution to this?

  I ended up waiting a bit and it appeared! Prof said it might be due to it still downloading.
