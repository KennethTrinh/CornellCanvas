 I am wondering whether it is ok to complete the first assignment just in Mac Terminal. The commands are the same generally. Thanks in advance!

  As for A1, I don't think there would be a problem working on a Mac Terminal. It would be a good choice to be equipped with the VM for later assignments though :)
