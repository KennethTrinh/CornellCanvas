  Do we get just one resubmission for A2? And if the script is producing the proper output and is in the correct directory should it get credit?

  Adding on to this, the professor mentioned that he will rerun the grading each day. Does this mean our grade will automatically be updated to 1 if the resubmission is correct, or will the regrading occur after friday?

  You may resubmit as many times as it takes through 11:59PM on Friday.   I should re-run the grading scripts each morning.   That said, I didn't re-run the scripts on Monday , but I did just re-run this morning (Tuesday).
