  It's a good question, but make sure you understand that "push" only comes into play when there are upstream repositories hosted somewhere such as GitHub.com.     The importance of Friday's lecture was to point out that git can be used in a "self contained" way on your local machine where everything is stored locally.   As such, you only need to "commit" because that stores the changes in the local repository.    Then all I'm asking you to do is re-zip the directory with the repository in it and submit that.

  We will learn about upstream repos and pushing in a future lecture!
