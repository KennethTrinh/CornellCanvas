  I have been using VMware with no problem until now, but now it's not responding and just showing this black screen. Same problem even if I restart vmware or restart my computer (mac m1). Is there a solution to this?

  I just ran into this preparing for tomorrow's lecture.   Unfortunately, it's a bit of pain to get it to respond again.   If you bring your laptop to class tomorrow I can help you with it after lecture.
