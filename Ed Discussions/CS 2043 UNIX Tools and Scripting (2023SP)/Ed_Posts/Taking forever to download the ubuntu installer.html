 It's taking forever for my computer to download the ubuntu installer. I was wondering if this was expected or if there's something I could do to make it download faster.

  Me too. The time keeps going up to or at least fluctuating. Now it's saying "Opening in 3 days".

  The ISO file itself is around 3.5 GB, so yes it's a big file. Depending on your location your internet speed could be the issue. When using the Cornell Wi-Fi it took me no more than 30 mins. If you're having internet speed troubles it could be the location and time.
