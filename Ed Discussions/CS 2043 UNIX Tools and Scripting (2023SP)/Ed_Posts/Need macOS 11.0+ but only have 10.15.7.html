  I downloaded the VMWare license but I cannot install it because I have macOS 10.15.7 and it requires at least macOS 11. Is there another option for this situation?

  VMWare Fusion version 12 should run on your system.      Here's a link to info about it on the VMWare site:

  This seems to be fine for the 30 day trial. But after that I have to buy it for $150. Unless there is a free version available which I can't find. Only version 13 seems to be free.

  Try this link and let me know if it takes you to a page on the VMWare site that lets you register for a personal use license for Fusion Player 12:

  I think the latest version that is compatible is 12.0.0. The above version still doesn't work.
