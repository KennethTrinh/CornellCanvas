  I started the assignment and was able to find the file and run it and found it in my home directory on the ugclinux.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  What I am having a hard time with is moving said file to my Virtual Machine.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Can you give instructions on how to do that?

  I tried using the scp command as instructed but all it did was copy it to the remote system. Can you give a little more explanation as to how to do this?

  If you want to move a file from ugclinux to your VM, you should be doing your
  <code>
   scp
  </code>
  command within your VM terminal. Then you can do the command
 </paragraph>
 <pre>scp [netid]@132.236.91.186:/home/[netid]/[filename] .
</pre>

  This will copy your desired file from ugclinux to your "local" machine (in this case you should be doing it on your VM so it will appear as a file in your home directory on your VM. Then you can submit it to CMS
