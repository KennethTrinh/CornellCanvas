 I started the assignment and was able to find the file and run it and found it in my home directory on the ugclinux.
</p>
<p>
 What I am having a hard time with is moving said file to my Virtual Machine.
</p>
<p>
 Can you give instructions on how to do that?

  Should I copy the contents of the file and submit it in a file of the same name?
 </p>

  You can use the
  <code>
   scp
  </code>
  command like what is mentioned in #15

   I tried using the scp command as instructed but all it did was copy it to the remote system. Can you give a little more explanation as to how to do this?

    If you want to move a file from ugclinux to your VM, you should be doing your
    <code>
     scp
    </code>
    command within your VM terminal. Then you can do the command
   </p>
   <pre>scp [netid]@132.236.91.186:/home/[netid]/[filename] .
</pre>
   <p>
    This will copy your desired file from ugclinux to your "local" machine (in this case you should be doing it on your VM so it will appear as a file in your home directory on your VM. Then you can submit it to CMS
