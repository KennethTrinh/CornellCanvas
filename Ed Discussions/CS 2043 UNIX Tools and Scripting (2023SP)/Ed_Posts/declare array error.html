  I'm getting this error, but I have bash version 5.1.16(1)

  I used this shebang statement instead of #/bin/bash, which worked for me.

  However, are we allowed to use this, since you will be running it on your machine to test the file?

  I'm not sure that based 5.1.16 is the problem;  that's what I'm running in the Ubuntu VM I use for class and the declare command works just fine.

  You may want to post (privately) your script or email it to me and I can take a look at what else might have been causing the error you received!
