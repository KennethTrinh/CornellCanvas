 I'm getting this error, but I have bash version 5.1.16(1)
</p>
<p>
 and i used the shebang to ensure i am running bash. why is this happening? I copied the array declaration from the assignment

  I used this shebang statement instead of #/bin/bash, which worked for me.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, are we allowed to use this, since you will be running it on your machine to test the file?

  I'm not sure that based 5.1.16 is the problem;  that's what I'm running in the Ubuntu VM I use for class and the declare command works just fine.

 <p>
  You may want to post (privately) your script or email it to me and I can take a look at what else might have been causing the error you received!
