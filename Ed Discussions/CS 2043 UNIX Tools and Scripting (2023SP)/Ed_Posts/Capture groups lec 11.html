  Could you please explain this example? i.e., what the \1 and \2 are doing and why it outputs "world say hello back"; why is world printed before hello? Thank you!!
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Also, why is there a \ before sed? Thanks!

  When we wrap parts of the pattern we are matching with sed in parenthesis (and the parenthesis need to escaped so that they aren't interpreted as regular data) , each set of parenthesis identifies a "capture group".     The first set of parenthesis is capture group #1, the second set is capture group #2, and so on.   Then, in the text we are substituting for the found text, we can reference those capture groups by their number preceded by a backslash.   So the text "hello" is capture group #1, and the text "world" is capture group #2.     So when we have the following replacement text:
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  \2 say \1 back
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  we get
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  world say hello back
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The "\" before sed is just a line continuation.   If you were typing this in a terminal window the backslash by itself would signal to the shell that you are not done entering the command and will do so on the next line.
