  For anyone else who may be having trouble accessing the video recordings, I found that I wasn't able to watch them embedded in Canvas, but when I clicked on the actual hyperlink (in the title of the video, at the top of the video player), I was taken to a page where I could watch the recordings.

  Sorry, I should have mentioned that.   They are just links to the Cornell VOD service, so I'm not sure why they can't be viewed inline!
