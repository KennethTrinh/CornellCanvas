  Here in the first photo. awk goes through each line of marks.txt and looks for what is in between the first pair of /. Which is Ron in this case, then once it finds a match (which would be the word Ron in line 1) it executes the statement after the second / which is print $4 which prints the 4th column/field in the line, in this case that would be 90. THE BOLDED LINE IS WHAT WE WERE TOLD TO KNOW FOR THE PRELIM

  The second photo has some more explanations.

    Try using single quotes instead of double quotes.
