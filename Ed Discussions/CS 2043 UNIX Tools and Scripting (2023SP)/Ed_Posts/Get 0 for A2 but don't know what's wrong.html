  Please read the email I sent out on Sunday very carefully as I tried to explain exactly where your a2.sh and where your sentence.txt files need to be relative to the A2 directory.    Grading scripts were re-run this morning (Tuesday) so if you still have a "0" feel free to reach out directly via email or come to office hours.

     The script needs to be outside the A2 dir - at least i'm pretty sure. Thats prob why you got a 0 no? I also got a 0 though so idk lol
