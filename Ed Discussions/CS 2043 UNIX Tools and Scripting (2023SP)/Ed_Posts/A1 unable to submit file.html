 Hello, I have reached the final step in A1 and am trying to submit the file directly from my virtual environment. I have verified that the CS2043-A1-SubmitThisFile.txt file is in my home directory. The instructions say to run FireFox in my virtualized environment to access CMS so that I can submit directly from there.
</p>
<p>
 I am unclear how to do so. Does it just mean to open FireFox in Ubuntu and access CMS from there? When I do this and try to choose a file to upload, the does not show up in my home directory (see screenshot below)

 Thank you!
