  In the instructions for Assignment 4, it tells us that the shell script should error if (1) the email address is specified but not a second argument containing the path to the git repository and (2) if the email address is specified, but the second argument is a directory that doesn't exist.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  However, what should we do if both arguments are correctly provided, and the email address is not found -- ie, has 0 commits in the repository? Should this also be an error condition, or should we output the following:
 </paragraph>
 <pre>User &lt;email&gt; has made 0 commits
Longest message:

</pre>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Finally, when we issue errors, should we be using
  <code>
   exit 1
  </code>
  to exit with status code 1 and immediately terminate the script?
 </paragraph>

  No, you don't need to handle that situation.
