 In my VMware, I have A2 and a2.sh in my home directory. While writing the commands to put inside a2.sh, I reference "
 <strike>
  /A2/sentence.txt" and "
 </strike>
 /A2/nouns" and things like that instead of using "./A2/nouns".
</p>
<p>
 Is this ok? I was able to produce my desired output this way,but I do not if the autograder will be able to run this since i do not know where the A2 folder is located in that
</p>

  Not really.
 </p>
 <p>
  Without the dot notation, you're specifying an
  <b>
   absolute
  </b>
  path. This means that your script won't work unless the required files (nouns, sentence.txt, etc.) are located in the VM's base directory (/).
 </p>
 <p>
  By adding the dot notation, you are indicating that the path is
  <b>
   relative
  </b>
  , meaning that the starting point of whatever filename or directory following the dot is the current directory that the script is being run.
 </p>
 <p>
  The relative path notation makes more sense here since the script should work by running
  <code>
   ./a2.sh
  </code>
  whenever the required files or directories are in the same directory as the script.
 </p>
 <p>
  So
  <b>
   a)
  </b>
  make sure you don't have all your files in the base directory (
  <code>
   /A2/adverbs/...
  </code>
  , etc.) but somewhere else (
  <code>
   ~/A2/adverbs/...
  </code>
  for example), and
  <b>
   b)
  </b>
  you're running the script as
  <code>
   ./a2.sh
  </code>
  on
  <code>
   ~/A2
  </code>
  ).

   I dont understand where I'm supposed to ptut sentence.txt if it is not inside the A2 folder?
  </p>
  <p>
   Also, since sentence.txt does not exist inside the adjective/noun/adverb folder, but i need to cd into thee to access the random words, how do I get a word from inside that but put it in sentence txt which is outside of that folder?

    Just to clarify, I wasn't saying that you shouldn't put sentence.txt inside the A2 folder. I wanted to suggest that it's good practice to refrain from putting the scripts and folders in the root directory (/).
   </p>
   <p>
    Also, you can address the outer directories by the double dot (..) notation. For example, if you're in
    <code>
     ~/A2/adjectives
    </code>
    , you can
    <code>
     cd ../adverbs
    </code>
    to access the
    <code>
     ~/A2/adverbs
    </code>
    directory.

    <p>
     In regards to files inside A2, if I am inside A2 should I be referencing them as
    </p>
    <p>
     adjectives or ~/A2/adjectives?
    </p>
