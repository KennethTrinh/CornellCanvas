  When creating a new file(sentence.txt, a2.sh), it seems like we need to grant permissions to read/write/execute. Does this happen ushing chmod in the script a2.sh itself? Or does this happen elsewhere?

  If you change the permission so you can execute it on your machine, the permissions should be maintained when you submit.   But even if they aren't, my grading script will add u+x to the file before attempting to run it.
