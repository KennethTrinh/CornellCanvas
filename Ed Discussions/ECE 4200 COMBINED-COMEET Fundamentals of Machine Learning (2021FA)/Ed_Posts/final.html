 Hi Professor,
</p>
<p>
 Due to the stress of finals, skyrocketing COVID cases, and decreasing student morale, the CS ML class has made their final optional.  On top of this, their kaggle competition was also optional.   Is an optional final a possibility for us, or at least an online one to prioritize our safety ?

  I agree, I also think our Kaggle was a good culmination of the course and representation of our knowledge! Also, all of my other finals were moved online.
