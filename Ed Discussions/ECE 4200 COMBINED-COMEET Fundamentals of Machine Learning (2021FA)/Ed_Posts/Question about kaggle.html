  "A jupyter notebook that displays code and output of performance of Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression. The students taking the class for 5420 should also implement SVM and decision tree classifiers. Comment on the performance of these algorithms. (25%)"
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Does this mean as a 5420 student, we must implemet Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and SVM, then use these models on this dataset?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Can we use Sklearn to implement the above models?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Can we just use Pytorch to build a neural network (only use neural network)ï¼Ÿ

  You can use pytorch to build NNs if you wish, and use these as your main classifier to compete on the leaderboard. But as the rules state, you have to also upload a notebook that displays the code and the output of the performance of Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM etc.  Yes, you can use sklearn to implement them.
