 even for problem 2 where I set the hidden layer to be size 2, epoch 20000 is taking very very long.... Just wondering if this is the case for everybody?

  are you doing matrix vector multiplication or using for loops. I think vectorizing the inputs and doing matrix vector products helped speed it up for some folks.

   can you show me some example? and also what would be a "good" time to train 20000 epoch of hidden layer size 20?

    Can someone who has done this part tell about how long it took them?

     For 20000 epoch with learning rate 0.01 and hidden layer size 20, my code takes about ~3 minutes to run.
