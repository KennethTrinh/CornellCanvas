  Are there any available for this class? I just tried to run a very basic training/fit and my computer crashed (gave a graphics card related error). I'm concerned about what this will mean for when I try to run other training algorithms.

  I know other classes have been able to get VMs run through Cornell IT for students to remote desktop into. It would greatly even the playing field for any students whose computers do not have the computing power for this very resource-intensive dataset.

  As far as I tested models on this dataset, it wasn't really resource intensive. For most models and for this specific problem, having a powerful CPU won't make that big a difference because the speed up for matrix multiplication is significant only with a GPU, using which is prohibited for the competition.

  Can you give some details about the error and your system? It's hard to debug without any details.
