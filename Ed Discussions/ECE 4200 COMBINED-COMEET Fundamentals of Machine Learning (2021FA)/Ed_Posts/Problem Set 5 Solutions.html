  Will the solutions for Assignment 5 be posted before the midterm? I know that with slip days they cannot be released until at least midnight tonight, but would they be able to be posted as soon as possible after that deadline? Since we are being tested on content in that problem set tomorrow, I am worried that I might be misunderstanding something about SVM without even realizing it.  Thank you.
