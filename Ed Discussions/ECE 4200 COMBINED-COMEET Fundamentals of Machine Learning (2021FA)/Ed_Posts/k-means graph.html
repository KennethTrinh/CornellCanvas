  When I tried to test the k-means algorithm in A8, with 4 / 8 clusters both work fine. However, when I tried to increase the number of clusters to 16, all I am getting in the graph is just plain colour. (Actually any number greater than 8 gives me this kind of image)

  Never mind, I figured it out. It has something to do with the initialization of the centroids. Some centroids were not assigned any points, which caused the redistributing the centroids impossible, thus resulting this graph.
