 If you have trouble installing graphviz, you can try the following code instead.
</p>
<pre>tree.plot_tree(clf)  #clf is the decision tree you have learned
</pre>
<p>
 Replace
 <code>
  clf
 </code>
 by the name of your decision tree. The output would look something like this:
</p>
<pre>Text(22.32, 141.336, 'X[16] &lt;= 0.5\ngini = 0.456\nsamples = 111\nvalue = [39, 72]'),
 Text(8.928, 119.592, 'X[0] &lt;= 0.5\ngini = 0.353\nsamples = 70\nvalue = [16, 54]'),
 Text(4.464, 97.848, 'gini = 0.0\nsamples = 40\nvalue = [0, 40]'),
</pre>
<p>
 The first line corresponds to the root node, where you could read the splitting criteria by feature index.
 <break>
 </break>
 Keep in mind that features are indexed from 0 to 17.
 <break>
 </break>
 In this example, X[16] corresponds to the feature with index 16, which is “btm_right_sqr_o”.
