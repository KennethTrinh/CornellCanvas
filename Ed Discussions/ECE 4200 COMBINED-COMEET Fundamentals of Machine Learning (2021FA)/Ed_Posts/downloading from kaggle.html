 How do you download the notebook from Kaggle Code
 <i>
  with
 </i>
 the outputs from the cells? Using File &gt; Download Notebook generates an ipynb file with only the code, no outputs. (I want to avoid running the code locally, since it involves 90,000 sound files. And we need to submit an ipynb file for part of the assignment.)
