 I am having a hard time understand the following transition
</p>
<p>
 if w' = w/gamma', and t' = t/gamma', where gamma' = gamma * ||w||
</p>
<p>
 why would we want to minimize 0.5*||w||^2?
</p>
<p>
 also where are the 1/2 and square coming from?

 <p>
  minimizing 1/|w| is the same as maximizing |w|, which is the same as maximizing |w|^2
 </p>
 <p>
  note |w|^2 is a nice convex function which is now easy to differentiate compared to 1/|w|, which is not convex.
 </p>
 <p>
  The half is usually put to cancel the square after derivative.
