 <paragraph>
  I am having a hard time understand the following transition
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  if w' = w/gamma', and t' = t/gamma', where gamma' = gamma * ||w||
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  why would we want to minimize 0.5*||w||^2?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  also where are the 1/2 and square coming from?

  minimizing 1/|w| is the same as maximizing |w|, which is the same as maximizing |w|^2
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  note |w|^2 is a nice convex function which is now easy to differentiate compared to 1/|w|, which is not convex.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The half is usually put to cancel the square after derivative.
