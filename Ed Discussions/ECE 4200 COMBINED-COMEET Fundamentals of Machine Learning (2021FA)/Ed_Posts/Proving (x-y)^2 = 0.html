  For the proof that log is concave, I need to prove that (x-y)^2 &gt;=0. My first approach was to use the second partial derivative test to find the minimum. However, it results in the inconclusive case where H = fxx * fyy - fxy^2 =0. Is it sufficient to graph (x-y)^2 to prove that it is always equal or greater than zero? Or is a stronger proof necessary
