  I know we are supposed to find the distribution of y given we have feature X bar. I am just not 100% sure what is expected from this question. Does it want us to present the distribution of P(y|X)?  where y can take values of -1 or +1?

  But we do not really know P(y) or P(X).

  Indeed we don't know the exact distribution and we only want you to write a very simple expression $p(...)$ here.
