  In Gradescope, there are 3 options to submit the final competition results: best model, notebook for everything, and Kaggle report and code. I just want to double-check the following
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Best model: we submit the jupyter notebook containing only the best model
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Notebook for everything: submit every code we tried
