 In Gradescope, there are 3 options to submit the final competition results: best model, notebook for everything, and Kaggle report and code. I just want to double-check the following
</p>
<p>
 Best model: we submit the jupyter notebook containing only the best model
</p>
<p>
 Notebook for everything: submit every code we tried
</p>
<p>

  <b>
   Kaggle report and code : only contains the report but not the code?
  </b>
