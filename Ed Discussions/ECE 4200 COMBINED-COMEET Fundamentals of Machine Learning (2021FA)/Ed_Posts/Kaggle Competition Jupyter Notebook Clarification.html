 What does this bullet point mean? More specifically, are we supposed to show the results of running Logistic Regression and GNB for just the training set (such that performance becomes the accuracy on a train/test split), or for the testing set as well?

   Thank you. Then how should we submit the Jupyter notebook and report? Should this be done on Gradescope?
