 Dear class,
</p>
<p>
 I have received messages in support of in person exams and some wanting online exam.
</p>
<p>
 Having an in person finals will give a fair chance to students who would like to improve their standing in the class. If we shift or make finals optional, we give the students who have performed well on the competition and/or midterm a clear advantage over others. Is that fair?
</p>
<p>
 We have about 60 students taking the finals and there has been

 of covid transmission from the classroom settings. PHL101 is much more spacious than the place where we have our classes. We had our classes until last Tuesday in person with masks.
</p>
<p>
 If you have a serious concern (eg a positive test, other health problems, or anything else), and cannot/would not like to take the exam in person, please email me with the why, and we will solve them on a case by case basis.
</p>
<p>
 For all others, we plan to have the exam in person in PHL101 with a reduced capacity, masking and plenty social distancing.
</p>
<p>
 I know that no matter what we decide some of you will not like what we do.
</p>
<p>

  Given that we've moved to code red, Martha's email says that all exam will move to an online format as of noon Dec 14 - how should we proceed with this?
