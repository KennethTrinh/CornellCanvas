  I was wondering where could we find the solution to the hw assignments? Will it posted somewhere? It is super helpful if it can be posted for review purpose and check which part we get wrong and losing point in assignments.

  I updated the canvas post for Assignment 2 with the solutions. You should be able to find a link to download the solutions if you scroll down in the description for A2. Please let us know if you are unable to view it.
