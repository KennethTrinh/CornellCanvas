  Dear class,
 </paragraph>

  Sourbh has created a video for the Kaggle competition, and has uploaded some additional slides and jupyter notebook to canvas. This is the material for today's discussion!

  As you can see, he talks about FFT and spectrogram, which are critical in analysis of many types of signals, particularly time series, and image data. Please familiarize yourself with these concepts and you will find use for it someday I think!
