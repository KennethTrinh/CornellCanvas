 I am running Jupyter Notebook on a Mac, and I get the same error that some people have already posted. I have tried uninstalling and installing the graphviz package using different commands, but I never get it to work. Is it fine if I upload the notebook file as it is, since I know that the code I wrote is right and will execute correctly in any other computer? Thank you.
