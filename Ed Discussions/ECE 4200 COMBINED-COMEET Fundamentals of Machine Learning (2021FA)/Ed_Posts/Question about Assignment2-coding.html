  In problem 3, we are asked to "Repeat the first feature for 𝑖=1,2,3,....,300 times".
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I am not clear what is that mean? Is that mean “X_train only has the first feature” Or  “We used to have four features, now we have 300 features” ？

  "Repeating" a feature means constructing a new feature by copying an existing feature. If we have a data point X = (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4), repeating the feature x_1 once gives us X' = (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_1).

  So in this case, we would have X' = (x_1, x_1, x_1, x_1, ..., x_1)?

  The feature should be an "attribute". This is a typo.
