 Dear Class,
</p>
<p>
 We have uploaded the code for kNN with the example that we studied in class yesterday. Please run the code and see how normalization affects the accuracy. The accuracy without normalization is much worse than with normalization. Please run the codes and convince yourself that you understand the various answers by using the different classifiers.
