  Dear class,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  This week we will study our first supervised learning algorithm: decision trees.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Suggested readings and references:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Mitchell, Chapter 3 (check out the tennis example)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  CIML, Chapter 1 (this should be a short and crisp reading, good use of time!)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  It would be great to revise the concept of entropy from the last discussion's slides and/or the additional notes.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  spoiler alert: Decision trees will make a comeback in a few weeks to give us some of the best known algorithms with performance at par with deep Neural networks for several applications!
