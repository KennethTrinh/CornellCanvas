 Dear class,
</p>
<p>
 This week we will study our first supervised learning algorithm: decision trees.
</p>
<p>
 Suggested readings and references:
</p>
<p>
 Mitchell, Chapter 3 (check out the tennis example)
</p>
<p>
 CIML, Chapter 1 (this should be a short and crisp reading, good use of time!)
</p>
<p>
 It would be great to revise the concept of entropy from the last discussion's slides and/or the additional notes.
</p>
<p>
 spoiler alert: Decision trees will make a comeback in a few weeks to give us some of the best known algorithms with performance at par with deep Neural networks for several applications!
</p>
