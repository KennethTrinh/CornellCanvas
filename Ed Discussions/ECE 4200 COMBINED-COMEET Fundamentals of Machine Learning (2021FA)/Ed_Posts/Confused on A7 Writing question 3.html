 In class we talked about when we have a max function, the gradient of that max function corresponding to the smaller input is 0, and for the bigger input is 1.
</p>
<p>
 Iâ€™m doing the back propagation and dL/dx using the big input is non zero and dL/dx using the small input is zeroâ€¦. What should I do ðŸ¥º Iâ€™m a little lost

  Hi, I think what you are saying is correct, and your description gives statements not questions. So I don't quite understand where is the problem? For the gradients of the two inputs of the max function, indeed one of them is 1 and the other one is 0.
