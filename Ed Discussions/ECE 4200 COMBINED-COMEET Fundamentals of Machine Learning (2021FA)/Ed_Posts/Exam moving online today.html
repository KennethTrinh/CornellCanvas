  Yes. Just that don't write using any device like iPad since some of the students would do that with their homework in the past.

  Is this still a closed-book exam? Can we look at class notes on Canvas during the exam, for example?

  1. You can just write your answer on paper if you do not have a printer. It is perfectly fine.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. It is still a closed book exam. You should ideally open only one tab, which is the question paper, and all you should do with the computer is to scroll.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  3. Please leave your cameras on.

  For the final upload documents, should we just upload the figure or we need to convert them into a pdf file?

  You will upload on Gradescope and everything works like your assignment. Gradescope offers options to upload by pdf or figures.

  Where will we find the question paper? Canvas? Ed? Zoom chat link? Just trying to make sure where we should be keeping an eye on.
