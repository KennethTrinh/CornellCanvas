 <paragraph>
  In problem 1.2 and 1.3, we are asked to prove if the function is a kernel. I supposed to do this we had to prove if Mercer's theorem was satisfied for the given function.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  In class, we proved Mercer's theorem to hold when we were able to decompose K into its Phi(X) Phi(Y) counterparts. However, for the case of x+y or xy+1, it is not immediately apparent how to separate the K(x,y) function into a Phi(x) * Phi(y) format.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I guess I am just looking for a hint on how to use Mercer's theorem to solve these two questions.

  We actually proved part 1 in the class, so you can copy that part here. Recall the definition of Kernel function: If there exists a Phi:R^d-&gt;R^m such that
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  K\left(X,Y\right)=\Phi\left(X\right)\cdot\Phi\left(Y\right)
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  for all X,Y then K is a kernel function. For parts 2, 3 you need to argue whether you can find such a Phi or not?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Please go through those parts of the lecture including the examples where we showed somethings are not a kernel function and somethings are.
