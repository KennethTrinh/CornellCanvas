<p>
 what does problem 1.1 want us to do? I am a little confused and don't know where to start. Do we just find the gradient with respect to the ridge regression? Where is step size coming from in this case?

  Yes, then apply gradient descent using the gradient you have. The step size is just the learning rate.
