  For question 3, after running PCA, am I supposed to 500 images of size 128X128 or the original number of images each of size 500?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  After the dimensionality reduction, isn't each image supposed to be smaller? if so, 500 isn't a square of any number so how could I plot the image?

  Hi, after the PCA, you are supposed to get the principal components, each of 128X128.
