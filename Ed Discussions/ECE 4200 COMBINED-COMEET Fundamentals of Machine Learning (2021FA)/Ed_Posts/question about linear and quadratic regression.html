  I am having this internal debate about whether linear ridge regression or quadratic ridge regression is more prone to overfitting without regularization.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  my initial guess is that quadratic regression is more prone to overfitting because you introduce more factors and curves when it is not necessary. It is also more likely to be affected by outliers.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  but would that be a valid explanation?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Also, what is the difference between error and loss? Shouldn't they be the same thing?
