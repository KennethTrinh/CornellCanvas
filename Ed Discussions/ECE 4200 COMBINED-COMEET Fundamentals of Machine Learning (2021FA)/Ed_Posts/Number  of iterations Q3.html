 In Q3, for boosting it is asked to change the number of iterations. I could not see the number of iterations as a parameter of Adaboost. Did you mean the number of estimators? If not how it should be implemented?

  At each iteration t, we come up with a classifier $h_t$ so I think these two might be equivalent.
