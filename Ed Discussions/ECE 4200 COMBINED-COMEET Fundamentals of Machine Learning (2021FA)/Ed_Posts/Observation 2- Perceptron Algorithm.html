 Hi, I didn't understand why assuming that the norm of Wopt =1, means that |topt|&lt;1? (observation 2)

  Hi,
 </p>
 <p>
  It is not from the norm of Wopt. It is from the fact that we have normalized all feature vectors to have norm at most 1, ie, |Xi|\le 1.
 </p>
 <p>
  What does this mean? This means that all points are at a distance at most 1 from the origin, and therefore the optimal hyperplane is also at a distance at most one from the origin, since it passes through these points. Now, the distance of the optimal hyperplane from the origin is exactly |t_{opt}|.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hope this helps.
