  In lecture, we talked about K(x,y)=xy a kernel function, why is that’s case? What if his negative and x is positive

  So, the definition of a kernel is that
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  K\left(X,Y\right)=\ \Phi\left(X\right)\cdot\Phi\left(Y\right)
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  for a Phi. Here we have Phi(X)=X then we are done.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If x is +ve and y is -ve, then K(x,y) is negative. The kernel can take negative values. That does not violate the definition of kernels.

  Thank you! But if a kernel has negative value doesn’t it make the function not positive definite? I just have this question in the back of my head

  No. Take any Phi. By definition Phi(X)Phi(Y) is a kernel function. Phi(X) can be +ve and Phi(Y) can indeed be negative and their product can be negative.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Check the definition of PSD and our proof that any kernel function must be PSD. I just uploaded the lectures.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I am happy you asked this question. This is confusing many times and I would suggest going over last lectures and seeing why PSD holds. In particular, look at the following part for Phi(X) = X.

  Follow up questions:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1. why would K(x,y) = -xy not a kernel function? we can still find Phi(X) = -x and Phi(y) = y?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. Could we make Phi(x) = 0 in general?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  3. Is any non-negative constant number a kernel function where K(x,y) = c and c &gt;= 0, in general?

  1. Phi(x)=x is the identity function, so for all x, Phi(x)=x. That means that Phi(y)=y for all y. You must have the same Phi for both arguments of K.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. Yes, any function Phi:R^d-&gt;R^m is ok! Phi(X)=0 is a valid function.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  3. Yes. Take the function Phi(X)=sqrt{c} with m=1.
