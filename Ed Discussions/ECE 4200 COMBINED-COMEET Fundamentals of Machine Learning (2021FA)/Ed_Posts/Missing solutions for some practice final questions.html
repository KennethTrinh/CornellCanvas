 Would it be possible to get the answers to Q1e, 5d, 8, and 9 on the practice exam? Especially 1e and 8 because they look a little unfamiliar.
</p>
<p>
 Thanks!

  off the top of my head:
 </p>
 <p>
  1e: True (this in in learning theory, which we did not cover much). The idea is that if you have infinite samples, you know the distribution completely and that is what you train for.
 </p>
 <p>
  8: learning theory, ignore
 </p>
 <p>
  9: There are many ways to do this.
 </p>
 <p>
  a. Sum of positive semidefinite matrices is positive semidefinite. Use this to obtain the result.
 </p>
 <p>
  b. Let Phi_1 be the maping corresponding to K1, and Phi_2 be the mapping corresponding to K2. Then if you concatenate the two mappings to get Phi = [ Phi_1 Phi_2], then the kernel function you get is K1+K2.

   Thank you! That makes sense! For Q5d, should we expect to compute all the alphas, betas, deltas manually by hand/calculator?
  </p>
  <p>
   For the HW I wrote a little script but we can't do that for the exam of course

    yes :). otoh you have only 4 steps instead of five. so only 8 choices for A2,A3, A4 instead of 16.
