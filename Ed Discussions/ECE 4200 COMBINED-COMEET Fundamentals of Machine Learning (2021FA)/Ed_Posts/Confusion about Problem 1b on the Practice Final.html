  I am having a little bit of difficulty understanding why the above statement is true. As as an example, in a regression problem, if we have $\mathcal{H_1}$ be the set of all linear functions and $\mathcal{H_2}$ be the set of all polynomial functions, we have that $\mathcal{H_1} \subseteq \mathcal{H_2}$. However, my understanding is that the overfitting is more likely with $\mathcal{H_2}$ because, with higher degree polynomials, we have more degrees of freedom so we can fit both the data and the noise of the training set (or phrased differently, $\mathcal{H_2}$ has a lower bias and therefore a higher variance). I was wondering where this reasoning goes wrong. Thank you!
