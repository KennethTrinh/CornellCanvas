 I am confused about the update of weighe in Back-propagation:   Do we input one sample one time and hence the weights w have been updated for n times in one epoch(n is the number of the samples in a data set)?     Or do we input a matrix of n*m(or m*n, and m is the number of features) dimension and hence the weights w have been updated one time in one epoch?

  In practice usually, you would feed in a "batch" of samples, and then update the weights.
 </p>
 <p>
  Say, you are having 1000 samples and decide to run the training for 100 epochs, and feed the data with batch size 100.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then you are updating the model 1000/100=10 times per epoch, and a total of 100*10=1000 updates would happen in your training.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, you can define the batch size to be 1, then this is what you described in the beginning.
