  Hi, we said that in the  logistic regression we used the ML principle, but we tried to maximize p(y|x).  Isn't it the MAP estimator?

  Thanks!

  Great question.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  ML: you find the model that maximizes the data probability and no consideration for prior. In Logistic regression, your model is discriminative, ir you model p(y|x) and from data you find the best model that fits teh data.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  MAP: the key thing here is having a prior, and you update this prior distribution upon observing data. Hope this helps.
