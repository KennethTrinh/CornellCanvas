 Dear Professor,
</p>
<p>
 It seems that the training is able to work with or without StandardScaler and make_pipeline, and the results differ by a bit. I see that the two are imported in the header. May I kindly know whether they are required or recommended? I searched online about the two functions but the explanations do not seem to be very clear.... May I kindly know roughly what they do?
</p>
<p>
 Thank you!
