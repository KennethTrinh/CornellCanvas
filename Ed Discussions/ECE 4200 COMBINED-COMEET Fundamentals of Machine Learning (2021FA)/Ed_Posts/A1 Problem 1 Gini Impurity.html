  I've been getting Gini vs Gini Impurity concept mixed up. Could someone clarify these for me?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1. Does Gini(S) refer to Gini or Gini Impurity?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. Is the Gini Index the same as Gini or Gini Impurity?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  3. Is this the equation for Gini to Gini's Impurity?
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  1- \sum_{i\ =\ 1}^l\left(\frac{n_i}{n}\right)^2
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  3. When making a decision tree, do we pick the attribute with the lowest Gini Impurity value (or the highest) ?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thank you so much!

  1. Gini(s) refers to the gini index (as I believe it's called) which you calculate by
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  gini\left(S\right)\ =\ 1-\sum_{i=1}^l\left(\frac{n_i}{n}\right)^2
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  2. Gini index is what you use to calculate gini impurity. Gini impurity takes both the set that you're looking at as well as the attribute you are calculating for, so that
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  gini\left(S;\ A\right)\ =\ \sum_{j=1}^a\left(\frac{\left|S_{v_j}\right|}{\left|S\right|}\cdot gini\left(S_{v_j}\right)\right)
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  where S is the set and A is the attribute.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  3. See number 1.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  (presumably) 4. Pick the attribute with the lowest gini impurity value. The closer to 0 it is, the more cases in that node fall into a single category.
