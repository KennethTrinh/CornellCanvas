  What's the definition of a clause here? How long should it be? Can "P_1,1 v P_1,2" be a valid clause to include in the unsatisfiable core? Then How about a single "P_1,1"? is it too short?

  The minimal unsatisfiable core should be a subset of the original clauses such that the subset is unsatisfiable but removing any clause from the subset makes the set satisfiable. Neither $P_{11} \lor P_{12}$ nor $P_{1,1}$ cannot be in the unsatisfiable core, because they are not part of the original set of clauses.

  Why they are not part of the original clause? I think they are from Group 1? Then what could be a valid subset? Thank you!

  They are not from either group. Clauses in group I have the form $(P_{i1} \lor P_{i2} \lor ... \lor P_{iN})$ for pigeon $i$ and clauses in group II have the form $(\neg P_{i_1j} \lor \neg P_{i_2 j})$ for pigeons $i_1, i_2$ and pigeonhole $j$.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  An example of a valid subset is just the clauses from group I.

  I recommend considering what happens when you remove a clause of each group type. In each case, does the problem become feasible? If not, what is preventing feasibility?
