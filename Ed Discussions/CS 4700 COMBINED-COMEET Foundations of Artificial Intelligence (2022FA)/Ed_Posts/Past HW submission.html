 I am noticing that Gradescope is telling me "your instructor hasn't released any assignments yet", even though HW1 was submitted on there. Is that normal? When and where would there be feedback for past homework?

  Yes, sorry for any confusion. I had to temporarily change the submission format to instructor uploads to modify a submission, but that should be fixed now.
