  I might be wrong, but I found the pretty useful, it has even the derivation.

  Maybe it is better to double check with a TA, but you can take a look at it.

  That is a good reference!

  To hopefully avoid confusion as there are a couple of different versions of the formula shown on that page, we'll be flexible about the exact form of your answer but try to get something in base 2, e, or 10.

  Ex. if you want to approximate $k!$ you can use the approximation $ \text{ln} k! \approx \text{ln} k - k$ and then translate it to base $e$ by plugging the approximation into $k! = e^{\text{ln} k!}$.

  Is it required for us to show the calculation or can we directly give the approximation ans?
