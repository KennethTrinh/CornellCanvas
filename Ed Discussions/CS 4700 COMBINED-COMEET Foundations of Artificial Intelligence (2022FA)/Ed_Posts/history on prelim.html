  Will the prelim include problems about the history of artificial intelligence? If it does, will it ask about any names/dates/milestones or just general ideas and how they developed?

  No history in terms of "dry facts". I.e., no dates or specific names. But, you do need to know milestones we discussed in some detail class. Eg, you do need to know what IBM's "DeepBlue" did.
