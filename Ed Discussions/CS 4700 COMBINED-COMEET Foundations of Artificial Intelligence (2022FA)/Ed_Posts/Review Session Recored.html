  Can the review session today on zoom be recorded and posted? I have another in person review session going on during the same time for another CS class that won't be recorded but would still like to be able to watch this review session. Thank you!

  We can send a recording to students that have a conflict upon request, but we will not be widely posting the recording as we want people to attend and participate.
