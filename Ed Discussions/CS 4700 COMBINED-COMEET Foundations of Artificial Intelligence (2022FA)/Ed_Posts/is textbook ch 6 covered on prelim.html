 i was reading lecture notes abt SAT encoding and it says that it corresponds w the textbook chapter 7. but it also seems like chapter 6 covers SAT but more extensively? so do we also need to know how to do the different searches like forward checking, interleaving, local search, etc?

  For SAT, you just need to be familiar with what has been covered in lecture and in the assignments, though exam questions will be less involved than the homework.
