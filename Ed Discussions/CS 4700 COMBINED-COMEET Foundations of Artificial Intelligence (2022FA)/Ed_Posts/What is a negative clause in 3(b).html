 We have Group I and Group II clauses. I assume negative would refer to Group II, because those involve negations. However all of those are ambiguous in the original set of clauses (i and i' can be changed places), so removing a clause would not make the problem satisfiable. Does it mean that Group I clause is meant or should it be Group II but removed from the minimal core given in (a) instead of original set of clauses?

  You can assume $i &lt; i'$ so removing a single clause from group II makes the problem feasible. It is fine also fine if you answer (a) assuming this or not, it should be clear from your answer what you were assuming.
