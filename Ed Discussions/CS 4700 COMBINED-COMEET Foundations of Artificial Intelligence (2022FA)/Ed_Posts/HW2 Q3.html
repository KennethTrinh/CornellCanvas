 1. For part (a), For uniform-cost search, what happens if the path cost is the same when considering which node to expand next?
</p>
<p>
 2. For both (b-c), the node expansion order and the "correct" path to the goal seem the same. Is this correct or is there something I'm missing?
</p>

  (a) If multiple nodes have the same cost they can be expanded in any order and you only need to provide one ordering in your solution.
 </p>
 <p>
  (b) It is possible for greedy-first search and A* search to expand the same set of nodes and have the same path to the goal, but then f_greedy(n) = h(n) and f_A*(n) = g(n) + h(n) would need to result in the same node on the frontier having the minimum function value at each step. Does that happen in our instance?
