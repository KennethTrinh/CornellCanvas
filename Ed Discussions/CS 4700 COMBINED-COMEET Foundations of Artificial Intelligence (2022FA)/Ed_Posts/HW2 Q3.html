  1. For part (a), For uniform-cost search, what happens if the path cost is the same when considering which node to expand next?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. For both (b-c), the node expansion order and the "correct" path to the goal seem the same. Is this correct or is there something I'm missing?

  (a) If multiple nodes have the same cost they can be expanded in any order and you only need to provide one ordering in your solution.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  (b) It is possible for greedy-first search and A* search to expand the same set of nodes and have the same path to the goal, but then f_greedy(n) = h(n) and f_A*(n) = g(n) + h(n) would need to result in the same node on the frontier having the minimum function value at each step. Does that happen in our instance?
