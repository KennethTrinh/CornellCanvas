 Hi everyone,
 <break>
 </break>
 We just wanted to encourage everyone to fill out the mid-semester feedback. While the feedback is anonymous, we can see whether individuals did or did not submit feedback and we incorporate this into the participation portion of your grade.
</p>
<p>
 As discussed in more detail in #9, the participation portion of your grade is primarily used to bump you up if you are on a grade boundary.
</p>
<p>
 Best,
