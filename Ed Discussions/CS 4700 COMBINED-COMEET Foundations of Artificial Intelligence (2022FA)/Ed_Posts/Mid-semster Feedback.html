  Hi everyone,

  We just wanted to encourage everyone to fill out the mid-semester feedback. While the feedback is anonymous, we can see whether individuals did or did not submit feedback and we incorporate this into the participation portion of your grade.

  As discussed in more detail in #9, the participation portion of your grade is primarily used to bump you up if you are on a grade boundary.
