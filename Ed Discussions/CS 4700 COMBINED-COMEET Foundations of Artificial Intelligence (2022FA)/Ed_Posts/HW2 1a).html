 How should we assign the path costs? (i.e. what units, when to add to the cost)
</p>
<p>
 Is there a specific "correct" answer?

  There is an intended answer but we'll offer some flexibility when grading. Though, think a bit about your costs to make sure they don't cause unintended behaviour like allowing an infinite length optimal path.
