  c(n, a, n') is the cost of stepping from a node n to a successor node n' by action a. See Section 3.5.2 of the textbook for a discussion of g(n) vs. h(n) vs. c(n, a, n').

  I am not sure why my comment was deleted, but can you confirm if the first statement is saying that a heuristic is consistent if the heuristic step cost does not overestimate the actual stepcost ?

  Yep and it is often referred to as "local admissibility" for this reason -- it guarantees that the total estimated path cost does not decrease along any path (which you can see by re-writing as h(n) - h(n') &lt;= c(n, a, n')). The connection to triangle inequality is also helpful for understanding this -- it is impossible for h(n) to be a lower bound on the cost to reach G if there exists a route from n to G via n' that is cheaper than h(n).
