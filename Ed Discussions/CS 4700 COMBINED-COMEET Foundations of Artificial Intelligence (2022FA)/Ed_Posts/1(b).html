  If multiple paths have the largest payoff, you can report both of them. However, as a sanity check, make sure your solution path in parts b/c is a solution you found in part a, as alpha-beta pruning reduces the number of nodes you have to evaluate but doesn't change the answer.

  Do we also have to state the solution path for part a? I thought we only have to state the next node to move to from the first node

  Yes, you should report your solution, the first move max will make, and the value of that move.
