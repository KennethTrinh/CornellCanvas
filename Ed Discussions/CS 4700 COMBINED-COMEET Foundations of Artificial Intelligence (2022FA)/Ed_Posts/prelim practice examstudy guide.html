 Will there be any practice prelims/questions released or a study guide?

  Past exams are not a good fit with the material we covered. So, practicing on those would lead to confusion.
 </p>
 <p>
  The strategy for study should be:
 </p>
 <p>
  1)
  <i>
   <b>
    Core content: Lecture slides as posted so far
   </b>
   .
  </i>
  (The book can be used to clarify further but be very selective because the book has far too much additional material.)
 </p>
 <p>
  2)
  <i>
   <b>
    Homeworks and the solutions.
   </b>
  </i>
 </p>
 <p>
  Make sure you understand the solutions well!
 </p>
 <p>
  Solution to Hwk #3 will be posted on Tuesday evening.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   The midterm will have questions similar to those on the homework but less complex because of the time.
  </b>
