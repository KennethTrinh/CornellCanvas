  Past exams are not a good fit with the material we covered. So, practicing on those would lead to confusion.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The strategy for study should be:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1)
  <italic>
   <bold>
    Core content: Lecture slides as posted so far
   </bold>
   .
  </italic>
  (The book can be used to clarify further but be very selective because the book has far too much additional material.)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2)
  <italic>
   <bold>
    Homeworks and the solutions.
   </bold>
  </italic>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Make sure you understand the solutions well!

  Solution to Hwk #3 will be posted on Tuesday evening.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <bold>
   The midterm will have questions similar to those on the homework but less complex because of the time.
