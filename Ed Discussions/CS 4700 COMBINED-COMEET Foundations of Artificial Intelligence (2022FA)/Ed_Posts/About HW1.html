  I noticed that a lot of questions in HW1 seem to be open-ended questions. Just wondering is it expected that we find a "right "answer for each of them according to lecture material? Or is it more like answering them with our own reasoning/commonsense and drawing examples from class? Thank you.

  There is no single right answer for most of the questions in HW 1. We want to see that you have thought about the material and can present your reasoning clearly.

  Good question. I tried to address this issue with the note at the top of the homework:

  Note: The questions for this homework are largely conceptual. For several questions, there is
  <italic>
   <bold>
    no single
   </bold>
  </italic>
  <bold>
   right response
  </bold>
  . We are looking for responses that show that you have thought carefully about the issues.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  This doesn't mean that
  <italic>
   any
  </italic>
  answer is equally good ( :-) )  but there are multiple good ways to respond. Make sure your justifications are well-reasoned and coherent. Use ideas and information from examples discussed in class and careful reflection to answer the questions.
