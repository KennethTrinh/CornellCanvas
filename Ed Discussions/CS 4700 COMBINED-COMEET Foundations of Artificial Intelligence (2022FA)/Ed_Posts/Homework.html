  Just want to clarify, we have not received any homework or assignments yet, right? I don't recall any mention of it during lectures and don't see any in canvas, and I was getting a little concerned that I missed something since that's 40% of the grade

  Don't worry, you haven't missed anything! We'll make sure to make announcements in class and on Cavas when assignments become available.
