 I'm wondering if I can get some clarification on the definition of semantics.
</p>
<p>
 Sec. 7.3 of the text says "The semantics defines the
 <b>
  truth
 </b>
 of each sentence with respect to each
 <b>
  possible world
 </b>
 ." And we also have this figure here:

<p>
 To me, it seems here the semantics is at the sentence level. (i.e. each sentence will have its own semantics)
</p>
<p>
 But sec. 7.4.2 says "The semantics defines the rules for determining the truth of a sentence with respect to a particular model." My interpretation is now since this semantics defines the rule, it will be applied to every sentence in a particular model.
</p>
<p>
 That's why I'm confused.
</p>
<p>
 Thanks!

  You can think of syntax as specifying structure in our representation and semantics as specifying meaning, which defines truth with respect to a possible world. For example, we might specify the syntax of the statement 'x or y is one' is  $(x = 1) \lor (y = 1)$ but not  $x=1/y =1$. However, whether the statement is true or false depends on the values of $x$ and $y$. Further, the semantics of the larger statement, $(x = 1) \lor (y = 1)$, depends on the semantics of its components. I.e. the statement holds if $x=1, y=2$ but not if $x=0, y=4$.

   Thanks for the answer! I understand syntax is like "the rule of formatting". But I'm still confused here because the text gives two definitions for semantics.

    I think the definitions are in agreement, but I agree they are confusing.

    Semantics defines how we go from sentences in a representation to a truth value with respect to a possible world. For an atomic sentence, eg. $X$, this is a true/false value, but for more complicated sentences we need rules for how we go from components to a truth value. For example, our the rule for $X \lor Y$ is the statement is true if either $X$ or $Y$ is true but $X \land Y$ is only true if both $X$ and $Y$ are true. Semantics also needs to define rules for precedence. For example, is $X \lor Y \land Z$ true if only $X$ is true? This depends on whether you resolve the sentence as $X \lor (Y \land Z)$ or $(X \lor Y) \land Z$.
