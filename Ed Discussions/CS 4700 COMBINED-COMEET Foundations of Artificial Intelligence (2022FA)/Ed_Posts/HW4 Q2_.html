 Assuming that all the clauses are meant to imply the next one in order, I was able to simplify the list of clauses into a single clause. However, that single clause does not seem to equivalently imply $p_n$, so I was confused. (My final clause has all $n$ variables from the start, and the truth table is one where $p_n$ determines the final clausal value iff the other clauses from $p_1$ to $p_{n-1}$ all evaluate to True.)
</p>
<p>
 Can someone point me to where I might be going wrong?

  I guess kinda along the same lines of the original question but what exactly is the question even asking, when it says:
 </p>
 <p>
  "How many resolution steps are needed to
  <b>
   conclude that $p_n$ follows from these clauses?
  </b>
  "
 </p>
 <p>
  What does follow mean in this context?
 </p>

  Prof. Selman gave walked through a resolution proof during lecture (Wumpus World example), which described both how to assert resolution in such a proof (e.g. by contradiction) and how many steps are needed to reach resolution. In this case, "conclude that p_n follows from these clauses" can be interpreted as proving the resolution. See that lecture for a full walkthrough of such a proof.

   I saw the lecture for this proof, but I am still confused. What is the resolution? My final clause was the last clause in the list of clauses, but I am unsure how to go from there to $p_n$.

    A single resolution step has the form:
   </p>
   <p>
    $$(\alpha \lor \gamma) \land (\beta \lor \neg \gamma) \Rightarrow (\alpha \lor \beta)$$
   </p>
   <p>
    For example, an initial resolution step in our question could be
   </p>
   <p>
    $$ (p_1) \land (\neg p_1 \land p_2) \Rightarrow (p_2)$$
   </p>
   <p>
    Resolution is a type of proof by contradiction. So, in our question we are trying to show $(\text{KB} \land \neg p_n)$ is inconsistent. If you reach an empty clause, you have shown there are no model consistent with $\text{KB} \land \neg p_n$ and thus $p_n$ must be true.
   </p>
   <p>
    Let me know if that clears things up or if you have other questions.

    In the lecture it is discussed that, in a proof by resolution, resolution is established through contradiction. The goal is similar here -- to show a contradiction, which in turn results in the empty clause.

     why do we need to "show a contradiction"? I think the goal here is to reduces the clauses to Pn? why do we need to do contradiction

      The last part of the question asks "what is the final resolution step?". Resolution (via contradiction) is a way of proving the conclusion p_n.

       but if I do not use contradiction it should also work? Because I think we can obtain P_n from existing clauses.
      </p>
      <p>
       if we must use contradiction, we assume ~P_n, but our reduction reduce these clauses to P_n, so we reach a contradication?
