  Try to submit a proof with three steps, but if you can only find a longer proof please submit what you have. We will be generous when grading, but may take off minor points for proofs with redundant or unused steps. The shortest proof I am aware of is three steps, but it is great if you can come up with one that is shorter or if you want to try to prove that no shorter proof exists.
