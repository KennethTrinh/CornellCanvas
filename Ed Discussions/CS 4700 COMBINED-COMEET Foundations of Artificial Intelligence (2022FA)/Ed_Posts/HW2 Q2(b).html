 Could you give me a direction on how to approach this question? I've already created a counter example for (a) and proved how the longest path search strategy fails. How do I prove that it's unlikely to fix the uniform cost search method efficiently for finding the longest path? Should I use heuristic search?

  No "proof" is necessary for this problem, just reasoning about the nature of the longest path problem. The goal is to identify what properties of the longest path problem invalidate fixes to uniform cost search as a solution method. Solving shortest path vs. longest path problems (and what methods might be useful/efficient for each) and, importantly, whether those problems can be solved in polynomial time or not was discussed in the "problem solving by search" lecture in class. I would recommend returning to the lecture slides to gain an understanding for why an efficient algorithm might not work in this case.
