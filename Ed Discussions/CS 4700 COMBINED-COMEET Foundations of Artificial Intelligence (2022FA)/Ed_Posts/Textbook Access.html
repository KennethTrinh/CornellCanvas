 On canvas under the syllabus tab, it provides a link to "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (4th Edition)." But when I follow the link, it just shows the table of contents on the textbook website. The textbook doesnt appear in my VitalSource along with my other courses textbooks. I couldnt find a pdf online anywhere either. I was wondering how we can access this textbook? I enrolled in this class right before the last day of add/drop, so im not sure if this has already been covered.

  Sorry for the slow reply!

  There should be some copies of the textbook on reserve at the Engineering Library, but I don't see any online. We are checking with administrative staff and I'll get back to you as soon as they respond. I've also asked them if there is an online version.
