 Is it at all possible for us to submit the essay on or before the last day? Since some of us have exams running this week and the next, it's getting harder to find time completing the essay. I understand if it's impossible for that, thanks!

  I checked with Dr. Selman and he is allowing slip days to be used for the essay. So you can submit it by Sunday at 6pm using a slip day or as late as Tuesday, at 6pm using three. Hopefully that helps!

   I don't know if any of the slip days I have are left, is this extension based on the number of slips we have left?

    Yes, this is dependent on how many slip days you have left. I also checked and you have two slip days remaining. So you can submit up to Monday at 6pm with no penalty.
