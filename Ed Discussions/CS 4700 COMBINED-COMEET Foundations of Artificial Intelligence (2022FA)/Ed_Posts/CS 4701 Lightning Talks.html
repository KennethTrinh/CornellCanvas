 Congratulations on finishing the final exam!

 If anyone is interested in taking CS 4701, the AI practicum course, groups from this semester will be presenting two-minute 'lightning talks' from 2:00-3:15pm and 4:00-5:15pm tomorrow as well as 2:00-3:15pm Wednesday over Zoom. There are a wide variety of projects, from trying to use AI to differentiate between real and satirical news headlines to using neural networks to predict real estate prices.

 Here is the link for all three sessions if anyone is interested in dropping in:
