  If anyone is interested in taking CS 4701, the AI practicum course, groups from this semester will be presenting two-minute 'lightning talks' from 2:00-3:15pm and 4:00-5:15pm tomorrow as well as 2:00-3:15pm Wednesday over Zoom. There are a wide variety of projects, from trying to use AI to differentiate between real and satirical news headlines to using neural networks to predict real estate prices.
