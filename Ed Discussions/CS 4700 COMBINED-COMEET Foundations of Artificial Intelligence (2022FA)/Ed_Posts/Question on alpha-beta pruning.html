  I am a bit confused about the definition of "ancestors" in the slides:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  A MIN node can be $\alpha$ pruned if its own $\beta$ satisfies $\beta \leq \alpha$ of some MAX ancestor nodes.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Here by ancestors, do they refer to MAX nodes that have been explored so far? Or they mean MAX nodes that have been explored
  <bold>
   and
  </bold>
  are "directly" above the current node.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For example, in HW3 1c, node M could be pruned if we consider node G as its ancestor. We have explored node G but it is in a different branch.

  Thanks!

  An ancestor node must be on the path from the root to the node. I.e. in HW3 1c, the ancestors of node M are F, C, A. Nodes in other branches will influence whether or not you evaluate a node, but that is captured in the $\alpha/\beta$ values of the ancestor nodes.
