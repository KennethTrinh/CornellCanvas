  Also, some clarifications for HW3 Q2:

  Your answers should be in clausal form. A clause consists of variables or their negations connected by ors (i.e., a disjunction). It is implied that the clauses are connected together by a conjunction (logical ands). We will give partial credit to answers that are close to clausal form. E.g. you can start by using a logical implication as discussed in class. Note p ==&gt; q is equivalent to (~p v q). Also a biconditional ( p &lt;==&gt; q) is captured by two conditionals p ==&gt; q and q ===&gt; p. Each statement can then be converted into clausal form.

  Part 2c is somewhat challenging. You can assume that the $X_{ijk}$ variables are already following the constraints you specified in parts a) and b). This makes it easier to think of the right clauses. Two directions: (1) from X variables to a Y variable. And, the other direction, (2) from a Y variable to X variables. So, think "$Y_{ijk}$ ===&gt; (something about the X variables; think of an implication)." First think in words what you want to be the case.

  You can also give a non-clausal form and get credit for that.  Don't spend too much time on this part! We will be flexible in the grading.
