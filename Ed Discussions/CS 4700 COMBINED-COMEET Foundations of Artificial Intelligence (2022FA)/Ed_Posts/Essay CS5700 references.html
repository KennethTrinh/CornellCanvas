 About the references used for the essay can we just add them in the end of the paper or do we have to do in the citation format?
</p>
<p>
 I am asking because many of my references weren't addressing just a small part of the essay, but helping me  better understand GPT3 in general.

<p>
 Thanks!

  Yes, you can include citations in your bibliography that do not have a corresponding in-text citation.
