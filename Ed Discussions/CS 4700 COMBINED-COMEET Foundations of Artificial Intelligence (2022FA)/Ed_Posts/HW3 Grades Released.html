  Hi everyone,
  <break>
  </break>
  We just released grades for HW3. Overall, people did quite well on the assignment with a median of 91% and a mean of 85%. Most issues were with the SAT encoding question where the most common issue was only showing one direction for a bidirectional implication, ex. for 2a only showing one of 'at most one team plays in each subslot' and 'at least one team plays in each subslot'.
