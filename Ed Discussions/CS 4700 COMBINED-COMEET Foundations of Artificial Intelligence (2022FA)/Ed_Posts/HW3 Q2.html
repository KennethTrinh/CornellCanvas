 Can you explain this hint?
</p>
<p>
 Adopt the convention that two teams that play consecutive sublots — an odd numbered subslot followed by an even subslot — in fact play each other.

  Nothing profound. Each slot has two sub slots. Those are also numbered. So, you have subslot #1 and subslot #2 that form Slot #1. Then subslot #3 and subslot #4, that form Slot #2. Etc So, if a team plays in odd numbered slot L. Then its opponent is in subslot (L +1)  (even). -- Bart
