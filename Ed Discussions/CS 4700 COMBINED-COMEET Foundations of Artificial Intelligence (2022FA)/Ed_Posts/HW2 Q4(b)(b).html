  For this part (both case 1 and 2), do we just need to find a specific colorings for a1, a2, a3, a4 that would make the (x1 v x2) node have the correct coloring? Or do we have to find all potential colorings of a1 to a4 and prove that for all these combinations the (x1 v x2) node still have the correct coloring?

  You should handle all cases, not just provide a specific colouring. However you don't need to enumerate all colourings and can instead use a logical argument for the colour of the (x1 v x2) node and show at least one valid colouring exists.
