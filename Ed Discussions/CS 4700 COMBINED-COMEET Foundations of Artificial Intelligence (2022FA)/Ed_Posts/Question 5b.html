 I am a bit confused about how to show that x = y satisfies the axioms given. If we include S(a,b) and S(b,a) in our answer, does this equate to a = b?

  I'm not sure I fully understand your question. In 5b, You aren't trying to show any elements are equal. You want to give a set of relations such that the domain with elements $D = \{a,b,c\}$ satisfies the axioms.
 </p>
 <p>
  For example, $S(a,c), S(b,c), S(c,a)$ is the right format for an answer but is not the right answer as $S(a,c)$ and $S(b,c)$ violate the axiom $\forall x \forall y \forall z ( S(x,z) \land S(y,z) ) \Rightarrow (x = y)$.
