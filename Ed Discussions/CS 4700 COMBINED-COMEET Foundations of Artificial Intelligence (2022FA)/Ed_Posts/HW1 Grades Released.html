 The most common issue was not fully answering a question, ex. not providing an example or justification when they were asked for. There also seemed to be some confusion on the reinforcement learning question. The most common errors were:
</p>
<list style="number">
 <li>
  <p>
   Stating that playing against a stronger opponent would be equal or better to playing against yourself because you can learn from the stronger player's moves
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Stating that learning would be slower without mentioning that it can become prohibitively expensive, so no learning would occur for complex games like chess
  </p>
 </li>
</list>
<p>
 Best,
