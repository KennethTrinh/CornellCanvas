  There is no explicit recording of attendance. I like to give students some flexibility. However, questions on homework and exams will often include material and issues we discuss explicitly in class. So, you will benefit from attending class and participating in the discussions.
 </p>
 <p>
  The class participation component for the final grade is based on overall activities. Asking and responding to questions in class, participating in Ed Discussions, attending office hours etc. For the final grade, the way participation is incorporated is only in case your grade is on a letter grade boundary (say A- and A). In that case, good participation will move you up over the boundary (to A). No one will move down.

  Please keep track of your class participation activities! You will be asked to submit a list at the end. This is totally voluntary and can only help you, in the case discussed above.
