  Can we have a example of when this case would happen and why it gives a possibly non-optimal move?

  Consider investing $1000 where one investment has a guaranteed return of $1100 while another option has a 90% chance of losing all your money and a 10% chance of of giving you $11,001. The first option has an expectation of $1100 while the second option has an expectation of $1100.10. So, if you are maximizing expectation, you should choose the second option. However, in many cases you would prefer the guaranteed return over a high-risk investment.

  Thanks for the explanantion. So my understanding is that expectiminimax is suitable for those games that the opponent won't necessarily play optimally, is this correct?

  Expectminimax plays optimally in expectation. It is just in some cases we may be willing to trade a reduction in expectation for less variability, because the reward from a single run may differ significantly from the expectation. Ex. with the second investment 9 times out of 10 you'll lose all of your money even though in expectation you get $1100.10.
