 Hey, just checking (no rush or anything), when can we expect the grades (finals, hws, essay) to be released?
</p>
<p>
 Thanks!

  Hi! Most of our TAs have had their own finals and research papers due. They have just started the final round of grading (hwk 4 and exam). I'm hoping to be able to post the course grades by Friday morning. No worries. In my experience, everyone will be fine. This was a good group. Have a great break! -- Bart
