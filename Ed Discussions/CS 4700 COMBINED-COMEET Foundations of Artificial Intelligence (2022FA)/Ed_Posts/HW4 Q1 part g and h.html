 I wonder if I can get some clarification on parts g and h here.
</p>
<p>
 My understanding is these two parts relate to the space of possible truth assignments. If my understanding is correct, I'm not so sure why the hint is talking about Disjunctive Normal Form. I thought we can transform every DNF formula into a CNF one. Could you please explain where my thinking is wrong?
</p>
<p>
 Thanks!

  While you can transform every DNF formula into a CNF, it might be more intuitive to formulate a statement in one form than another. The hint is that belonging to a subset can be expressed well in DNF.
