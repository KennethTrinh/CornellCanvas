  For question 11 from the review session, I understand why the shortcut feature is the answer. However, I initially thought neither type of feature would likely be selected because I thought shortcut learning wasn't the best unless you counter it by developing a set of recommendations. Like with the tank example, it was based on lighting rather than actually finding the tank in the images, so wouldn't we not want to use either feature if we don't have a counter to improve the interpretation?

  Also, would it be possible to get the slides from the review session?

  Yes, you likely wouldn't want to use a shortcut feature as while it will improve your performance on the biased test/training data your model will likely not perform well for its intended application. The review question isn't focused on whether you would want to use the feature but whether it would perform well.

  It is quite hard to deal with shortcut features/biased data. Even detecting that the model is using a shortcut can be challenging for some models like neural networks where how the model is using the input values is not easily interpretable.

  Hello,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I am still confused because how would the shortcut feature perform well if its not actually doing the intended thing?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Or was the question asking about it in terms of training data?

  Shortcut features work perform well during training/testing because we are using the biased data in both cases. However, the model will not perform well when it is tested on data that lacks the shortcut, i.e. images of tanks in low lighting.
