  Hi everyone,

  Exams have been released on Gradescope. The prelim was more challenging than we intended, so grades were curved. We made 1g (3pts), 3c (5pts), and 4b (5pts) bonus and scaled so that if your original grade was $X\%$ your scaled grade is $100 \sqrt{X/87} \%$. For example, the unscaled mean was $68\%$ which scaled is $100 \sqrt{68/87} = 88.4\%$. Here is what the grade distribution looked like:

  Solutions are posted under the Modules tab on Canvas and regrades are open on Gradescope until
