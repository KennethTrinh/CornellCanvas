 I am a bit confused on question 5b. Can you further explain the D, the domain, and what we are supposed to do?

  The domain D defines the elements a, b, and c. The goal of Q5b is to specify a set of predicates over these elements such that the axioms in the problem description are satisfied -- e.g. define S(?,?)'s, where each ? is replaced by an element in D, such that the each of successor/predecessor axioms in the set up is satisfied.
