 For 3a, we only have to identify an "unsatisfiable core" but not necessarily an "minimum unsatisfiable core"?

  We use the two terms interchangeably. You should give a set of clauses such that removal of any clause makes the problem satisfiable and explain both why it is unsatisfiable and how removing any clause would make it satisfiable.
