  Could I push this again? I really need to know ASAP to let the TAs from either class know. Thanks.

  The prelim will be on Thursday evening, so it should not conflict with your other exam.

  I've asked Dr. Selman for the exact time and will get back to you as soon as I hear back. Sorry for the delay!
