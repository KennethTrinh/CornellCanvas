  Hi everyone,
  <break>

  For Q6 on HW4 we ask you to test several queries on GPT3 using OpenAI Playground. Just for signing up, you get $18 credit and the assignment only took me $0.02. So, most people shouldn't have any issues.

  However, if you have previously used OpenAI playground and have no credit and don't want to setup a billing account, or if you are running into other issues, you can email me at leg86@cornell.edu and I'll send you some screenshots. You still need to interpret the screenshots. So, It is probably both faster and easier to run it yourself.

  Best,
