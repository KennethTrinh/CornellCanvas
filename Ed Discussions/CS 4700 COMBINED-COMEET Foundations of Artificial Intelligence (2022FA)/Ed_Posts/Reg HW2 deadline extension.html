 Hey, I know this is kinda last minute, but given that A* was covered on Monday, is there any chance of extending the deadline for HW2, thanks!!

   Since other students also seem interested in an extension, I've passed your request onto Dr. Selman and will let you know if I hear back. Though, remember that everyone has 7 slip days to use over the course of the semester (where you can use at most 3 per assignment and a weekend counts as one day). So, anyone can use two slip days to hand in the assignment by Sunday at 6pm.

    However, writing down the solutions is taking time, especially with prelims scheduled for today. If that extension is possible, at least till tomorrow evening, it'd be really helpful; thanks!
