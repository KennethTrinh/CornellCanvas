  Hi all -
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  So I'm sure most of you have heard by now: OpenAI just released this chatbot that is absolutely incredible.  You can literally ask it
  <bold>
   anything
  </bold>
  and it will output an accurate response
  <bold>
   .
  </bold>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Can we use this AI to take the exam (AI to solve AI)? Probably not, but it's still cool anyway.  Check out this dialogue it produced.
