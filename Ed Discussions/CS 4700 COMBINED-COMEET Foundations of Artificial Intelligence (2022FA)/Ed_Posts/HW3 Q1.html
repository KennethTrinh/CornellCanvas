 For Q1(b), what is "Strike out all static evaluation values that do not need to be
 <break>
 </break>
 computed."? Is this the same as showing the nodes that aren't evaluated?

  Wording is a bit awkward. Just indicate which leaf node values do not need to be computed (i.e., are skipped in the pruned search) and which parts of the tree are cutoff by the pruning.
