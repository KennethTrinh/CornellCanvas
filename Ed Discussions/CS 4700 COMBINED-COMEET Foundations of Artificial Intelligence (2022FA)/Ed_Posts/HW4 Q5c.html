 Hey, can you help me with (5c)? I am unable to understand the hint. I'm assuming that the question is still talking about predecessor relationship, but I don't know what axiom makes, say, the model in (5b) to have an infinite domain!?
</p>
<p>
 Thanks!

  The model in 5b has a finite domain. In 5c you want to add an axiom that results in any model satisfying the axioms requiring an infinite domain. For the hint, the positive integers have an infinite domain and follow the axioms. However, zero has a property not covered by the current axioms that allows the positive integers to have an infinite domain. If you are having a hard time coming up with the property, try applying the axioms to 0, 1, and 2.
