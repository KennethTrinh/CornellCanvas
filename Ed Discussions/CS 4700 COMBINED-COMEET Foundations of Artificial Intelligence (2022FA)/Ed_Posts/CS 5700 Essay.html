  I have the same doubt. If I have all the slip days remaining, can I use 3 slip days with the weekend being counted as 1 slip and then 2 weekdays after that, which allows me to submit the essay by 13th December without penalty?

  I checked with Dr. Selman and he said slip days can be used for the essay, so I have extended the late due date.
