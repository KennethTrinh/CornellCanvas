 Hi everyone,
 <break>
 </break>
 We just released the grades for HW2. Overall, people did very well with a median of 89%. Note that there are 5 points of bonus, so you can calculate your percentage out of 90 points instead of 95. The most common issues were for 2 (c) not handling cycles when describing how to find the longest path with DFS and for 4 (a) 3 not using CNF form or adding additional clauses.

 Solutions are posted on Canvas under the Homework tab on the
 <a href="https://canvas.cornell.edu/courses/45035/modules">
  Modules page
 </a>
 and
 <b>
  regrade requests are open until midnight on Friday, October 28th
 </b>
 . Also, we hope to get midterms back by the end of next week.
</p>
<p>
 Best,
