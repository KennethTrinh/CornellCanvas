  Hi everyone,
  <break>
  </break>
  We just released the grades for HW2. Overall, people did very well with a median of 89%. Note that there are 5 points of bonus, so you can calculate your percentage out of 90 points instead of 95. The most common issues were for 2 (c) not handling cycles when describing how to find the longest path with DFS and for 4 (a) 3 not using CNF form or adding additional clauses.
