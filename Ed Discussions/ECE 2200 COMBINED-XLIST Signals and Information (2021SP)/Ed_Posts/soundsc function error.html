  When I try to do Lab 2 Section 3.2 from the AM/FM document I get an error when I use the soundsc( ) function. The error is as follows:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Warning: Unable to play audio because no audio outputs were found.
 </paragraph>
 <blockquote>
  In audioplayer/hasNoAudioHardware (line 640) In audioplayer/initialize (line 268) In audioplayer (line 231) In sound (line 71) In soundsc (line 55) Warning: Unable to play audio because no audio outputs were found. In audioplayer/hasNoAudioHardware (line 640) In audioplayer/play (line 28) In sound (line 74) In soundsc (line 55)
 </blockquote>

  I don't understand why it isn't recognizing any audio outputs (I've tried connecting earphones as well, but to no avail). Is there any way this can be fixed? Do I need to change any of my MATLAB settings?

  It is hard to debug by just looking at this warning message (it can be the problem of your OS, etc.).

  But since it is a minor issue, if you cannot fix it just let your TA check off your code.
