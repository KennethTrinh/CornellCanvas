 When I try to do Lab 2 Section 3.2 from the AM/FM document I get an error when I use the soundsc( ) function. The error is as follows:
</p>
<p>
 Warning: Unable to play audio because no audio outputs were found.
</p>
<blockquote>
 In audioplayer/hasNoAudioHardware (line 640) In audioplayer/initialize (line 268) In audioplayer (line 231) In sound (line 71) In soundsc (line 55) Warning: Unable to play audio because no audio outputs were found. In audioplayer/hasNoAudioHardware (line 640) In audioplayer/play (line 28) In sound (line 74) In soundsc (line 55)
</blockquote>

 I don't understand why it isn't recognizing any audio outputs (I've tried connecting earphones as well, but to no avail). Is there any way this can be fixed? Do I need to change any of my MATLAB settings?

  It is hard to debug by just looking at this warning message (it can be the problem of your OS, etc.).
 </p>
 <p>
  But since it is a minor issue, if you cannot fix it just let your TA check off your code.
