 In HW4 P5, I was wondering why you dont "fold" the cos(2pi*150*t) term when converting x(t) into x[n]. The solution set says to make 2pi*fs*n*Ts = w'n to find w', which makes sense for the 50Hz signal since 2*50 &lt; 250, but for the 150Hz cosine shouldn't we fold it into 100Hz, since 150Hz = 100Hz for a 250 sampling frequency.

  If I understand your question correctly, my answer is: the "folding" happened later when I converted $1.2 \pi$ to $0.8 \pi$.  We could have found the principal continuous-time aliases first, as you suggest (i.e. "fold" the 150 Hz term into a 100 Hz term and then sample), and the answer would have come out the same.
