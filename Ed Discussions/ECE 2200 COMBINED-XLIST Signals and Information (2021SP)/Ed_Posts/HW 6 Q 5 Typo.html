 The homework 6 question five contains the equation
</p>
<math>
 \hat{H}\left(\hat{\omega}\right) = A\left(\hat{\omega}\right)e^{-j7\hat{\omega}}
</math>
<p>
 Should I assume that the 7 is a typo since it doesn't align with the form of the frequency reponse that we learned in lecture?

  How does that form disagree with the form we discussed in class?
