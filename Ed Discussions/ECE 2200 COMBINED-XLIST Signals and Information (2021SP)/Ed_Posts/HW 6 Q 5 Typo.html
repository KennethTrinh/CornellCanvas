  The homework 6 question five contains the equation
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  \hat{H}\left(\hat{\omega}\right) = A\left(\hat{\omega}\right)e^{-j7\hat{\omega}}
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  Should I assume that the 7 is a typo since it doesn't align with the form of the frequency reponse that we learned in lecture?

  How does that form disagree with the form we discussed in class?
