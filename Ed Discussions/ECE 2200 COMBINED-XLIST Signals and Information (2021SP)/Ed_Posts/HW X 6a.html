  I think you mean $a _ 2$.  The way the $a$'s are defined, they're
  <i>
   minus
  </i>
  the coefficients of powers of $z ^ {- 1}$ in the denominator polynomial of $H ( z )$ --- that's because the past $y$-terms appear on the right-hand side of the difference equation with coefficients $a _ k$.  Note also what $a _ 1$ is.
