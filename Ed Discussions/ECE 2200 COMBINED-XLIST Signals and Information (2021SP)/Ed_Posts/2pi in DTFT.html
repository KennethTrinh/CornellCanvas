  In the previous lecture, it's briefly mentioned that the DTFT of a pure complex exp sinusoid is a dirac delta function of magnitude 2pi. I understand the intuition behind the dirichlet curve narrowing into a delta function as N (and hence L) increases, but where does this factor of 2pi come from? I know it's part of the formula for the analysis equation, but what is the intuition behind this factor, and why does transforming back and forth between the analysis and synthesis equations result in a difference factor of 2pi?

  The math just comes out that way.Â  More specifically, difficult-ish  math  shows that

  $\int _ {- \pi} ^ \pi D _ L ( \widehat{\omega} ) d \widehat{\omega} \longrightarrow 2 \pi$
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  as $L \rightarrow \infty$.
