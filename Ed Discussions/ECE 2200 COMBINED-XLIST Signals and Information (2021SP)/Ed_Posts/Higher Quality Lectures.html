  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I was wondering if there is any way we could get the higher quality videos of the lectures after April 13. Thank you!

  The chem guys haven't posted them yet.  I'll give them a nudge.  I feel bad because they're totally doing us a favor, but I get how much students like them.

  Update: I e-mailed Dylan and Michael, and they got right back to me.  The lectures from last week will go up tonight.  The one from Thursday 15 April might take longer (somehow my lecture got merged with a chemistry professor's, so they have to peel them apart).
