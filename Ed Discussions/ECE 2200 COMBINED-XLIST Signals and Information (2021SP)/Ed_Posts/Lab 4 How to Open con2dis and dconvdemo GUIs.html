  How do you open con2dis and dconvdemo? I know conv() and firfilt() are downloaded and work, but I don't know how to access the GUIs. Do I have to download them separately or do I already have them downloaded if I have conv and firfilt?

  I think they're in the spfirst folder from when you downloaded the toolbox, and you can just open them .m file from there.

  If you downloaded the toolbox you can also just type con2dis or dconvdemo in the command window
