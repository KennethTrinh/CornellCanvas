 How do you open con2dis and dconvdemo? I know conv() and firfilt() are downloaded and work, but I don't know how to access the GUIs. Do I have to download them separately or do I already have them downloaded if I have conv and firfilt?

   If you downloaded the toolbox you can also just type con2dis or dconvdemo in the command window

    I think they're in the spfirst folder from when you downloaded the toolbox, and you can just open them .m file from there.
