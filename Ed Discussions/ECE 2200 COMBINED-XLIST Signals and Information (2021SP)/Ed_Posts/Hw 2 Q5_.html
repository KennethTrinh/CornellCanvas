 I think the basic fact is confusing me. When I try to use it for part (c), it seems to imply that all a_k values (for k != 0) are 0. I know this cannot be true. Could you please explain it again?

  Because of the properties of $x ( t )$, the limits of integration end up not being $0$ to $T _ o$, so the Basic Fact doesn't come into play ... does that help?
