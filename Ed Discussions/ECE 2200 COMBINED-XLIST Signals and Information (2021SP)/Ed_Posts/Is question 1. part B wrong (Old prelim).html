  The solution graph to part B says y[n]s values for n = [0,1,2,3,4] = [1,2,2,2,1].  Shouldn't y[n] at n = 2,3 be 3, not 2?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  At y[2], its h[2]*x[2] + h[2]*x[1] + h[2]*x[0] + h[2]*x[-1] = 3
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  , and
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  at y[3], its  h[3]*x[3] + h[2]*x[2] + h[2]*x[1] + h[2]*x[0] = 3
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Doing everything else, would the final answer be
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  for n = [0,1,2,3,4,5], y[n] = [1,2,3,3,0,0]

  $x [ n ]$ has only two 1's in it, at $n = 0$ and $n = 1$, so no way can you get a 3 for any $y [ n ]$.
