 For this one can I get some help for part a, I'm not really sure how to simplify the sum of exponentials I have. In the lecture, certain factors of the exponentials were pulled out to get into a form with sines and cosines but I can't seem to find any way here. Should I try phasor addition
</p>

    Oops, yeah, that was a private exchange.  here's approximately what I wrote.  I suggest not putting $\widehat{H} ( \widehat{\omega} )$ into a simplified form but rather figuring out the magnitudes and phases individually for the frequencies necessary for part (b).

   Set x[n] = e^(jnw) and plug in to that equation for y[n]. Remember that when the input is of the form e^(jnw), the output will be H(w)*e^(jnw). Set them equal and solve for H(w). I don't think this has to be in sines and cosines; you can just leave it with the exponentials.
