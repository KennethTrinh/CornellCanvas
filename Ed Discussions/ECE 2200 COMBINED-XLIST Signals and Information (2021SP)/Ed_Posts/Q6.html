 I'm not really sure about part b,c for this problem. When I did part b for this problem, I got a really complicated answer for X[k]. I was especially confused in part b since it said to leave the answers in terms of N,but x[n] only runs from 0 to 4 and N = 6. So, the L In the dirilecht function would be technically (N-2) and then after that I got super confused. Tje only reason I knew it was gonna be a 6 pt circular convolution for part c was since I j knew that Q[k] = X[k]H[k],which implies Q(w) =X(w)H(w) which leads to that taking a form of a regular convolution x[n] × h[n] which is only non-zwro for 0 to 6 from the plot in part a. I don't know if that makes any sense and I don't even think any of this is correct. So any help is highly appreciated.

  Part (b) should really say "in terms of $e^ {- j  k 2 \pi / 6}$.  I didn't want you messing with Dirichlet stuff for this problem --- I wanted you to be messing with sums of raw powers of $e ^ {- j k 2 \pi / 6}$.
