  My version of Matlab doesn't accept resample(y, new_fs, fs). I went to OH and the TA said to get around this by using the online version of matlab and I've updated the version on my computer. So I tried both of those, but the online version won't let me upload my files (which is necessary for 01.mat and other files), so I still can't work on the lab. Any tips for how to get around this so resample works? Is there a way I can verify my graphs so I can move on to the next section?

  I also tried using the online version in multiple different browsers and it still won't let me upload.
