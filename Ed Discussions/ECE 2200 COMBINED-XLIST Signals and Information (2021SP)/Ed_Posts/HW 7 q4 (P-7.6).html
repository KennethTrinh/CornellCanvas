 Can we apply the general forms for low pass, high pass, and band pass filters for these problems? Can we use convolution to write each signal as Ae^() * (filter sequence)? We then get an answer of a constant * time shifted impulse function * sinc function
</p>
<p>
 Also I am not sure how to get the formula for a band pass filter in terms of a low pass and high pass filter
</p>

  Regarding the first question, I'm not sure you can do it that way because of the phase factors.   Furthermore, I don't understand the rest of your first paragraph.  :-\
 </p>
 <p>
  You can think of the frequency response of an ideal bandpass in various was as combos of low- and high-pass.  One easy way: it's the difference between the frequency responses of two ideal low-passes, one with a higher cutoff frequency than the other.

   Why can't we factor the phase factors out and treat the signal as a multiplication of two signals?

    What's given aren't signals but functions of $\widehat{\omega}$.  Maybe if you could elaborate on your proposal I could understand/assess it better.
