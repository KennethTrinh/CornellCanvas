  I don't think this was answered in class directly but what exactly do we need the textbook for if not for labs/assignments or to read before class. Is it just supplemental material for us to reference when doing assignments/labs or to review after lectures?

  Mostly just supplemental, but sometimes I'll assign a HW problem straight from the book.  I think it helps to see the material covered in different ways.
