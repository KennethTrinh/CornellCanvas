  How does the phase change exactly? I understand that the frequency would change by a factor of k*sample frequency, but I am not sure how exactly to calculate the respective phase.

  This problem is one of those that Tuesday's lecture might help with.  Suffice it to say that the phase will turn out either the same as or the negative of what you started with, kind of like when we calculated the principal continuous-time alias in class on Thursday we had two cases, etc.
