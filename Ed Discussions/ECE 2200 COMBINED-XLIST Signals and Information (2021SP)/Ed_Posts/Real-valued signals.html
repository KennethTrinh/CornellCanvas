 I have a general question based on the lecture content up until now. When we say a signal is a "real-valued" signal, does this imply that it is continuous-valued?
</p>
<p>
 I know "real-valued" means x(t) could take on a value in the space of real numbers, but could it be restricted to certain real numbers and be discrete-valued?
</p>
<p>
 Thank you!

  It could be restricted to certain real values.  For example a square wave that for all integers $n$ satisfies
 </p>
 <p>
  $x ( t ) = \left \{ \begin{array}{cl} 1 &amp; {\rm whem} \; n \leq t &lt; n + 1 / 2 \\ 0 &amp; {\rm when} \; n + 1 / 2 \leq t &lt; n + 1 \end{array} \right .$

  is a real-valued signal that takes on only 0 and 1 as values.  Usually we say "real-valued" when we want to contrast with "complex-valued."
