  Since there is a division by zero error at $\hat{X}$[0], should we hardcode the correct value at that position (i.e. x(1) = correct value), or is there a better way to do this?

  I would probably do it that way at least for the $N = 5$ case.  For big $N$, sometimes it pays just to leave out $k = 0$ when you're plotting it (if you see what I mean).
