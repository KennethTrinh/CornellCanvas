  first lecture we discussed colors and how all colors could be mapped to rgb, are there orthonormal basis for colors? RGB is one bc any color can produce a color in the space of color, are there other ones, I'm googling but I found nothing very useful?

  Not sure what one might mean by "orthoonormal basis" in this context.  Any venue in which orthonormal bases exist must allow for taking linear combinations (what might  $7 \times {\rm red} - 3 \times {\rm blue}$ mean?) and a notion of orthogonality (what might it mean for two colors to be orthogonal?).

  Like are there other colors that I could use to potentially produce all other colors?

  In middle school, they taught me that the primary colors were red, yellow, and blue.  Thus I'd imagine that $\{R, Y , B \}$ and $\{ R , G , B \}$ both "span the space of all colors."

  how many such triplets are there, are there infinitely many? here I assume that a color is specified by some EM frequency in the continuous spectrum.

  Thanks alot! I thought it was interesting and figured that a yes would mean we can make LCDs with all kinds of leds which I thought would be cool.
