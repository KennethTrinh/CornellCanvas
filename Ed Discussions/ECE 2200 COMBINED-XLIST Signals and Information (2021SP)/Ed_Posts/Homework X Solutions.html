  I've held off on publishing them (they're uploaded) so people could mess around with the problems for a while.  Is that a vain hope on my part?

   Yeah it would be helpful to check my answers as I work through the problems.

    Okay, I'll publish them now.  I just worry that people will be like, "Oh, right, yup" as they look at the problems in parallel with the solutions.
