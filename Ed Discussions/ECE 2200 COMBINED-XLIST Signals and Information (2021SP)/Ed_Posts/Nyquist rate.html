  Does sampling at frequencies higher than the nyquist rate increase the quality of the reconstructed signal? or is having 2 samples per period allow us to reconstruct a signal completely and taking more samples isn't really useful?

  Mathematically, faster sampling makes no improvement.  In practice, in which case you're using only a (possibly long) finite string of samples rather than all $\infty$ of them, oversampling will help.
