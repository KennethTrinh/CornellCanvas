 I just wanted to clarify something. Since the Amplitude for the first cosine term is negative when graphing would we just add the phase shift to pi?

  Not sure what you mean when you say "when graphing," but yeah, the standard form for a pure real-valued sinusoid is $A \cos ( 2 \pi f _ o t + \phi )$ where $A &gt; 0$ and $\phi \in ( - \pi , \pi ]$, so adding or subtracting $\pi$ from the phase will always get you into that form when your "original" amplitude is negative.
