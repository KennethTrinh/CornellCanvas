  Can you show how to go "full euler" on this question by writing x(t) as the product of the real aprts of complex exponentials? Whenever I try it this way it doesn't seem to work. I don't understand why.

  You never want to write $x ( t )$ as the product of real parts.  Going full Euler means writing every cosine and sine as a sum or difference of complex exponentials.

  Just to be clear:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  We can rewrite a sum of sinusodial functions as the sum of real parts of complex exponentials.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  We can rewrite a product of of sinusodial functions only as the product of the expanded Euler versions.

  The first statement is true.  The second statement isn't true, i.e. you can write a product of sinusoidal functions as the product of real parts, but IT DOESN"T HELP --- i.e. you never want to do it.  You always want to go full Euler on the factors.
