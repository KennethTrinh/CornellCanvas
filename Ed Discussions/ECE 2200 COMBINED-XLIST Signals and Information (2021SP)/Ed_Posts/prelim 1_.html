  The prelim will cover material on Homeworks I through IV, which means Vhapters 1 through 4 in the book except for the stuff at the end of Chapter 4 on discrete-time signals and discrete-time spectra, which we'll cover in lecture tomorrow.  If you're signed up for the remote version of the class, you supposedly received an e-mail from me about the prelim, time zones, etc.  Please let me know if that's not the case.
