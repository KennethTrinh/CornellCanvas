 If a cosine emerges from the ideal D-to-C, then we know its frequency must be less than f_s / 2. However, what if a non-periodic signal emerges from the magic box? Is that possible?

  That can happen, but not in the universe of pure sinusoids and linear combos thereof, which is where we live in ECE 2200.

  Actually, a non-periodic signal
  <i>
   can
  </i>
  emerge even in the sinusoidal universe if the input to the box comes from sampling a sum of sinusoids with frequencies not harmonically related, in which case you deal with them one term at a time, and the output of the box might end up non-periodic.
