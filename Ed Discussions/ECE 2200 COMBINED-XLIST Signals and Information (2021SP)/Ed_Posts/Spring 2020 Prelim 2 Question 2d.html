  I'm really confused how to approach this problem. I was reading the textbook, and for examples where they have some complex signal and multiply u[n] by it, they use the length of the impulse response to say that y[n] is steady state when n&gt;= length-1 it seems, but even then I'm confused with the reasoning there, so I'm confused what exactly is happening when we shift it by 5. If our h[n] is only nonzero for n between 0 and 4, and we have a x[n] that starts at n=5, how do we expect any output?

  The solutions say the output is the same as c, but c is 15, not 5, is this a typo?

  I think the answer given in the solution is off by a factor of 3

  Yup, but at least the text is right ("same as the answer to (c)").  :-)
