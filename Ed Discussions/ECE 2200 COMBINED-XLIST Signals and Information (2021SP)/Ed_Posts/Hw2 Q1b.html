  Is that equation of a(k) correct to use and will we need to convert x(t) to exponential form to do the integral? Also, how do we find the value of N once we find a(k)?

  We went over this near the beginning of last Thursday's class.  You don't need to do any integrating to solve this problem.  Once you've found $f _ o$ in (a), the answer to (b) arises just by re-indexing terms in the original sum for $x ( t )$ and using Euler on the cosines.

  But doesn't the question ask us to find an geneal equation for ak or does it simply want us to list the various ak's that are going to be non-zero

  You just want to find the specific numbers $a _ k$ that work for this specific signal.
