  For this question, are we assuming that $$d_r = 55m$$  and $$d_t = 1000m$$? It says to express as a function of x.  Should we also include $d_r$ and $d_t$ as well?

  dr and dt are inherently included in the equations for d1 and d2. since it's distance formula, d1 = sqrt(x^2 + dt^2) and d2 = sqrt((x-dr)^2 + dt^2))  + dr. they just already substituted in values.
