 For this problem, why must (iii) be true such that Ts &lt; 1/74? What if the input x(t) is exactly the same as y(t) = 7cos(2pi(37)t + pi/7)? That way it doesn't matter if you sample beyond the Nyquist rate, because y(t) will be the same?

  The output of the ideal D-to-C with interpolation interval $T _ s$ must have bandwidth less than $f _ 2 / 2$, which means we need $37 &lt; f _ s / 2 = 1 / ( 2 T _ s )$.  Accordingly, $74 T _ s &lt; 1$, or $T _ s &lt; 1 / 74$.

  BTW it's not a "practice prelim," it's just a previous semester's prelim.  :-)
