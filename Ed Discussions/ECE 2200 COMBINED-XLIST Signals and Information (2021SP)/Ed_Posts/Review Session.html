 In regard to the previous email, I was wondering if it would be possible for you to host a review session before the final? I think it would definitely improve learning and final grades because we've talked about a lot of concepts this semester and it would be nice to have a refresher on them. Thanks for your consideration!

  Review sessions are tricky to schedule (time that works for everyone who wants to come, space with adequate board and maybe camera if we simulcast it, etc.).  Exams take up most of the good rooms now.  I hesitate to attempt it.  And if we had one, it would be Q&amp;A rather than me talking unprompted.  Talking-unprompted review sessions lead to this: "He didn't say anything about it in the review session, but it was on the exam."

   Would it be possible to hold a Q&amp;A over zoom?

    Tablet writing is awkward for me.  I wonder whether I could set up my laptop to capture a major swath of board in a conference room.

    Plus the time-that-works-for-people problem remains.
