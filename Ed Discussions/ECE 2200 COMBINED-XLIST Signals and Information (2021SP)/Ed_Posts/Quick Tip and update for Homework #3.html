 As I was grading Problem 4 on Homework 3, there was part of that problem that asked you to find the general complex coefficient of the sawtooth signal, which required integrating by parts.
</p>
<p>
 Many students came up with the right answer, although not simplified. If your answer was something similar to:
</p>
<p>
 ak = (-1 + (j2pik+ 1)e^-j2pik)/4(pik)^2
</p>
<p>
 I will try and return points I may have taken off.
</p>
<p>
 We can evaluate this expression further using our knowledge of Euler's Identity,
</p>
<p>
 e^jtheta = cos(theta)+jsin(theta)
</p>
<p>
 If theta = 2pik where k is any integer, because cos and sin are 2pi periodic, theta can be reduced to 2pi, giving us
</p>
<p>
 e^j2pik = e^j2pi
</p>
<p>
 We follow this step by using Euler's identity
</p>
<p>
 e^j2pi = cos(2pi) + jsin(2pi) = 1 + 0 = 1
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Therefore, e^j2pik, where k is any integer, is 1.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 In the case of this problem, simplifying ak will give you ak= j/2pik. Please let me know if anyone has questions about this, as it's a common identity that can simplify many problems.

  Other little tricks for simplification
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   1/j = -j
  </b>
  (multiply top and bottom by j)
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   e^jpi/2 = j
  </b>
  (evaluate Euler's identity)
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   cos(pik) where k is any integer = (-1)^k
  </b>
 </p>
 <p>
  I hope this helps!
