  Why the t here can be negative? What does it mean when t is negative for x(t)? Also, can n be negative for those negative t? Thanks in advance.

  For x(t) to have a value when t is negative implies that x(t) is defined for a negative input t.

  Given this equation for the D to C converter with sampling frequency 0.4 seconds and y[n] and p(t) defined in the question, y(t) would be a sum of multiples that include when t is negative and when n is negative, but y[n] is 0 for a negative input of n.
