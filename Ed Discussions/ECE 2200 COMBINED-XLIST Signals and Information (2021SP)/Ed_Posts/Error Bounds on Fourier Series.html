 This was earlier in the semester, but is there a systematic way to determine the minimum number of terms in a Fourier series to approximate a function given a bound an error? Also is there a way of quantifying how "chaotic" a signal is (Continous or Discrete)?

  It totally depends on the periodic signal you're expanding.  Some general formulas exist, but they're not too useful in applications IMHO.

    Just a follow up:

    Sampling maybe interpreted as a data compression algorithm that is lossless if the sampling rate is above the nyquist rate and lossy if it is below it right?

     You could definitely think of it that way.
