 I'm still pretty confused about how to calculate the number of MAC operations required to compute a sum. If y[n] is the convolution of h[n] and x[n], why does y[0] only require 1 operation and y[1] require 2? I think I'm thinking about this very wrong, but why would it not require (1024) * (the length of y[n]) MAC operations?
</p>
<math>
 y\left[n\right]\ =\ \sum_{k=0}^{1023}h\left[k\right]x\left[n-k\right]
</math>

 How would we go about solving question 7 on homework 8? None of my attempts bring me anywhere near a number on the order of 512.5*10^11. Thanks

  Also just wanted to point out that it actually says 512.5*2^11 on the hw, not *10^11 (I made this same mistake reading the problem)

   Ohhhh that makes way more sense, thanks so much! I was really wondering why I was like 7 orders of magnitude off

  When $n = 0$, that sum has only one nonzero term.  When $n = 1$, only two.  Etc.  Thus MAC ops required to compute a $y [ n ]$-value for some $n$ varies with $n$.

   Oh I see. So why would the number of operations not just be 2*((1024*1025)/2) based on the suggestion at the end of the problem?

    Work through it carefully and you'll see how it goes ...

    It might help to work through the case where you're convolving a 4-point signal with a 5-point signal to get the ide.
