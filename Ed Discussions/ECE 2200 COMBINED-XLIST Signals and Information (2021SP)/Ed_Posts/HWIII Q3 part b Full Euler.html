 When we go full Euler on the three sinusoid multiplication, why don't we convert the sine function to cosine at the end? I think the answer key did a sine expansion for Euler's sine formula, but isn't the previous two function cosine?

  This solution requires correction.  I've noted it somewhere before (I think on Canvas), but I haven't had time to correct it before the prelim.  Essentially, the first two factors should have + signs instead of - signs.  The leading $1 / 8j$ is fine, as is the last factor.  Since the error propagates, it'll take me a while to chug through the correction.
