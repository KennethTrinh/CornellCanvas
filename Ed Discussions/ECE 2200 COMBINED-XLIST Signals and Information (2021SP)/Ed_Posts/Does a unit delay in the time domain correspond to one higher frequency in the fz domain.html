  Since the DTFT of a signal x[n] = 5ẟ[n-1] + 4ẟ[n-3] is 5e^-jw +4e^-3jw, does something like a unit delay in a block diagram affect one higher frequency in the frequency domain?

 <paragraph>
  Additionally, since the DTFT of a time delayed signal x[n-n0] is e^iwn0, does that also show that time delaying affects a higher frequency sinusoid

  A unit delay in a block diagram corresponds to multiplication by a factor of $e ^ {- j \widehat{\omega}}$ in the frequency domain.

  I don't understand your second question as you've phrased it.

  I guess I was trying to conceptually understand what the X(w) spectra represents. If time shifting is multiplying by e^-jw, that means the spectra to the right increases. I was wondering if increasing spectra to the right meant magnifying higher frequency sinusoids.

  I don't think it means the "spectra to the right increases."  What the multiplicative factor does is introduce a phase change in the spectrum --- it has no effect on the spectral magnitude because $e ^ {- j \widehat{\omega}}$ has magnitude 1.
