 I'm having trouble identifying what is the difference between theta and psi in this problem. It looks to me like they use similar equations tan(theta) = y/x and psi = arctan(y/x) [unless I am mistaken about this] and I don't understand why this would cause a shift in pi for psi. Thanks!

  I suggest drawing a picture.  Consider the two numbers $1 + j$ and $- 1 - j$.  In both cases, $\tan ^ {- 1} ( y / x ) = \pi / 4$, but $1 + j = e ^ {j \pi / 4}$ while $- 1 - j = e ^ {- j 3 \pi / 4}$.
