 I'm still confused as to how lab times work. Do we complete labs before the lab session and simply get it checked off during the session or do we do that labs during the lab session and get it checked off.

  We plan to have two TAs virtually running each lab session.  One will be available for just checking off students who've done the whole thing ahead of time, and the other will be available for more intense help for students who need or want it.

  The first lab will just be a MATLAB refresher.

   So do we submit labs anywhere or do we simply get it checked off.
