  I'm having some trouble expanding the explanation from 8b) to other frequency responses for IIR systems. For instance, if $H(z) = \frac{z-.5}{z+.5}$, there would be a 0 at z=.5 and a pole at z=-.5, but what would that correspond to in terms of $\hat{w}$? I cant think of some $\hat{w}$ such that $e^{j\hat{w}}= \pm .5$, since there is no imaginary component.

  The frequency response in this problem and for the example you cite is never exactly equal to zero.  You want to determine whether it's larger near zero frequency vs. frequency $\pi$ or the other way around.  Not sure whether this gets at your question ....
