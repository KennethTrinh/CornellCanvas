 I'm having trouble understanding conceptually how taking the inverse DFT recreates x[n], when the inverse DTFT also recreates x[n]. Since the DFT is a sampled version of the DTFT, isn't it missing a lot of information? For instance, here
</p>

<p>
 we are missing the peak of $\hat{X}_4(\hat{w})$. Since x[n] requires the full continuity of the DTFT to be recreated, how can we recreate x[n] when we're only given a finite number of w-domain values, that changes based on how many samples we take?
</p>
<p>
 In the example above, zero-padding the signal would increase the sampling rate, and provide some new (different) information about $\hat{X}_4(\hat{w})$ that was not captured in the previous DFT. How can this still produce the same x[n]?
</p>
<p>
 Thank you!

  You've hit on what I call the Reverse Sampling Theorem.  It's essentially dual to the actual Sampling Theorem.  Here's the parallel.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sampling Theorem: If you know that a continuous-time signal is bandlimited to within $f _ {\rm max}$, then you can reconstruct the signal completely from its samples $x ( n T _ s )$ provided $f _ s = 1 / T _ s &gt; 2 f _ {\rm. max}$.
 </p>
 <p>
  Reverse Sampling Theorem: If you know that $\widehat{X} ( \widehat{\omega} )$ is the DTFT of a discrete-time signal that has duration at most $N$, then you can reconstruct $\widehat{X} ( \widehat{\omega} )$ completely from samples $\widehat{X} ( k 2 \pi / M )$, $0 \leq k &lt; M$, provided $M \geq N$.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the Sampling Theorem, your "prior knowledge" is that the signal is bandlimited.  In the Reverse, your prior knowledge is that that function $\widehat{X} ( \widehat{\omega} )$ is the DTFT of a finite-duration signal.  In both theorems, you're amazed that you can rebuild a continuous thing out of a discrete sampling of it.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Reverse theorem requires only finitely many samples as opposed to a countable infinity in the Sampling Theorem because $\widehat{X} ( \widehat{\omega} )$ is $2 \pi$-periodic.
