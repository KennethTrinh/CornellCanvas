  Is it possible there's a bk value that could be anything? I have 4 bk values, and three of them all relate to one of them a certain way, but I can't seem to get a way to solve for that one bk value. Would it mean that this one bk value could change, and it would work so long as the other bk values are properly related? Or am I on the wrong track?

  Yeah, that's definitely possible, just as in lecture today.
