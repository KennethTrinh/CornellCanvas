 This is probably obvious, but is it always the case that when doing pfd on a fraction with complex roots in the denominator, the coefficients belonging to the complex conjugate pairs will be complex conjugates of each other? For example:
</p>
<p>
 $\frac{a_0 z}{z^2 + b_1 z + b_2} \rightarrow \frac{C_0}{z-z_0} + \frac{C_0^*}{z-z_0^*}$
</p>
<p>
 Where the polynomial in the first fraction has complex roots $z_0, z_0^*$?
</p>
<p>
 And is there an easy way to see this?

  One big theorem is that roots of a polynomial with real coefficients come in.complex conjuagate pairs.

  As for the partial-fractions coefficients being conjugates of one another when all the coefficients in the numerator and denominator of $X ( z )$ are real, you can see that either from the formula for the coefficients or by combining your two terms above --- to get a real number $a _ o$, you'll need the coefficients to be conjugates of each other.
