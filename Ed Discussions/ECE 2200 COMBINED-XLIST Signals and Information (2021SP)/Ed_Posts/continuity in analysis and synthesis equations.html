  I'm a little confused about the continuity of the signals returned by each of the equations. Why would taking a discrete sum result in a continuous signal? And why would an integral of a continuous signal result in a discrete signal? Thank you!

  Discrete sum to continuous signal: how about Fourier series?  As it happens, the values of $x [ n ]$ are kind of like the Fourier-series coefficients of $\widehat{X} ( \widehat{\omega} )$ viewed as a $2 \pi$-periodic function of $\widehat{\omega}$.

  Continuous integral to discrete signal: for each $n$-value, the integral on the right-hand side gives you a number.  That number is the value of $x [ n ]$.  Both sides of the equation are "functions of $n$."  Hot sure how to make this clearer (or at least less murky).
