 Where can I find the handout/table for z transforms that has been mentioned in lecture this week?

  The table's in the book.  The handout will explain the partial_fractions-type procedure associated with getting signal from $z$-transform.  I think I'll fold that into a larger handout on "loose ends" including the so-called Pesky Boundary Case.
