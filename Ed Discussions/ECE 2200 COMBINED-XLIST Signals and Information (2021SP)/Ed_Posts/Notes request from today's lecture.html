 Would someone be willing to post lecture notes from today, as we await the lecture recordings to still be posted? Many folks (especially people in different time zones) may not be able to attend the synchronous lecture, and this will be much appreciated! Thank you very much!

  Also, if Zoom fails us, we might have an in-house video from the chemistry IT guys.  I'll know more tomorrow.
