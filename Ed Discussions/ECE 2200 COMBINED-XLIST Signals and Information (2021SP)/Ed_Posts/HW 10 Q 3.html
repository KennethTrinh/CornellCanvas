 If x is a delta function and is only 1 as n=0,2,5, how would y[n] have a value for n=1? Wouldn't it be zero because x would be zero? And same thing for 2&lt;=n&lt;5, isn't x zero for n=3,4?

  No, like for example, system processes $\delta [ n ]$ to give us $h [ n ]$, and the latter has  nonzero values for all $n \geq 0$ even though the input that gives rise to it has nonzero value only at $n = 0$.
