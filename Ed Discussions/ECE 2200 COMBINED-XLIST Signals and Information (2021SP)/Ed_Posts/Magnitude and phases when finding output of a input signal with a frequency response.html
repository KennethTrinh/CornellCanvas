 <paragraph>
  If we have H(w) = (w-2pi)*e^(-jw2)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  and
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  x[n] = 3 + cos(pi*n/4) and we want to find the output of the input signal with a frequency response
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  for the 3, would you get 2pi for the magnitude and then e^(-j*pi) for the phase since H(0) = -2*pi?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  for the cos(pi*n/4), would you get pi*3/4 for the magnitude and then e^(-j*(pi/2+pi) for the phase since H(pi/4) = -pi*3/4? The phase would reduce to e^(-j*(pi*3/2) = e^(-j*(-pi/2)) = e^(j*(pi/2))
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  So a final answer of:  6pi*e^(-j*pi) + pi*3/4cos(pi*n/4 + pi/2)
