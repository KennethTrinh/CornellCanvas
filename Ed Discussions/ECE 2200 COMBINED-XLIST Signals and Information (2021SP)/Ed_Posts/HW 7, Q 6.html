  How do you go from the first line of equations (with 4 summations) to the second line (with delta functions)? Is it just plugging in a lot of combinations of k and n in our heads?

  I reasoned as follows: the first two sums' terms are all zero except possibly the $k = 4$-terms because of the $\delta [ k - 4 ]$.  That term is $\delta [ n ]$ in the first sum and $\delta [ n - 2 ]$ in the second sum.  Reason similarly about the third and fourth sums.
