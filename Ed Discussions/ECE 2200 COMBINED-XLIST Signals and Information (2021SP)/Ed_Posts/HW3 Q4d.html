 Sorry if this is a dumb question, but for part d, why is it sin(k2πt) instead of cos(k2πt) in the series expansion?

  It comes out that way.  Mathematical reason: $x ( t )$ is a constant plus an odd function of $t$, which turns out to imply that its Fourier series has only a constant and sine terms.  We didn't prove that or anything.
