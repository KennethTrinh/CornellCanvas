 Does it mean that we are sampling above the Nyquist rate?

  A $T _ s$-interpolator doesn't involve sampling anything --- just the opposite.  It's a system that creates a continuous-time signal by interpolating between the values of a discrete-time signal.  The ideal $T _ s$ interpolator is a specific system --- i.e. idealness isn't a property of certain $T _ s$-interpolators, like you would never say "these are ideal $T _ s$-interpolators and these aren't."  We've seen what the ideal $T _ s$-interpolator does to certain discrete-time signals $x [ n ]$ (namely sampled sinusoids), and we saw the formula for what it does to a general $x [ n ]$, namely
 </p>
 <p>
  $y ( t ) = \sum _ {n = - \infty} ^ \infty x [ n ] p ( t - n T _ s )$
 </p>
 <p>
  where
 </p>
 <p>
  $p ( t ) = \frac{\sin\frac{\pi}{T _ s} t}{\frac{\pi}{Y _ s} t}$.
