 Due to wellness day this week being on a Friday, most engineering classes (including this class) moved their deadlines to Thursday instead. Some classes have even made take home prelims due on Thursday as well.
</p>
<p>
 It is very stressful to have one less day to do a regular week's worth of work for every class and defeats the purpose of the wellness day. Because of this I wanted to ask if could we have an unofficial extension to Friday for this problem set?

  You may have the extension if you want.  The university forbids us to have stuff due officially during or the day after Wellness Days.  BTW please e-mail me because that's how I keep track of these things.

  FWIW I had planned originally for HW VII to be due tonight (Wednesday) --- the previous homework was due last Wednesday --- but decided to push it back a day.
