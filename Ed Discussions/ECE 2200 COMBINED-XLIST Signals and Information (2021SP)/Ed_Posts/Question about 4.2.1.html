 It says that tt is the times used, but since the frequencies are constantly different, is the tt vector supposed to be several columns wide. Additionally, is the xx vector one column or multiple columns.

  tt and xx are supposed to be two arrays. Note that xx is the sum of the cosine waves.

   But how many columns does tt have since tt varies based the on the different frequencies within the list?

    Each consine wave has the same sampling frequency fs. And since the duration is dur, the length of tt/each cosine wave/xx  should be dur*fs.
