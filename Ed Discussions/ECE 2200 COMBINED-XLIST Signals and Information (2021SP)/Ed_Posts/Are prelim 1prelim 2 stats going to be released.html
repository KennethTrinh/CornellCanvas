 I remember mention of prelim 1 stats being released but we never got them as far as I know. Would it be possible to get them still? Also, will we get stats for prelim 2? It helps a lot as far as knowing how well we are doing in the course in my opinion.

  Happy to provide stats for everything even though I don't use them in any systematic way.  I need to compute them first.  I'll do it soon.  Feel free to nudge me in case it slips.
