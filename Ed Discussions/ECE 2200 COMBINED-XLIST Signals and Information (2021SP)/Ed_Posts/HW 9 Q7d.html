 In part d, I understand how we got the two parts and summed them together, but I thought the second term, like the previous part, was using Q(z)=X(z)/z, and I'm confused why we can still use that relation here even when theres the other part being summed into it.

   Sorry, I meant that we solved for the .8/z-.9 part using the idea of X=Q/Z, like the previous part of the question I believe? I understand this relation in part c because we said x[n]=q[n-n0] and the X(z)=z^-1Q(z), and it seems like we also used this relation in part d, but I'm a little confused why this relation works when X(z) is equal to z/(z-.9) + .8/(z-.9). Maybe I'm just misunderstanding it completely?

    The $z$-transform is linear, i.e. sum of signals results in sum of their $z$-transforms.  Here I analyzed the two terms in $X ( z )$ separately and added the results to get $x [ n ]$.  Or am I missing your point again?
