  For this question, I was wondering how one alias was:

  Since it is in the alpha case, shouldn't the equation being used be 3 cos(2π(-2800 + 8000*k)t + π/3)? I'm a little confused by why 2800 positive and π/3 is negative

  2800 is positive just because 0.7 is already the normalized discrete-time omega so you convert it to fprin = omega * 4000 = 2800; π/3 is negative precisely because it started as negative and you're in the alpha case.

  Yeah so 2800 is positive, and the equation we were given in class is if fprin is between 0, ts/2 then the formula for the aliases is given by
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  A\cos\left(2\pi\left(-f_{prin}+kf_s\right)t+\phi\right)
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  But in the solutions they use +2800 - 8000 which would be
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  A\cos\left(2\pi\left(f_{prin}-kf_s\right)t+\phi\right)
 </math>

  Oh my bad, didn't even notice they had the negative sign on the kfs term instead of fprin, but also I was under the impression that the two sets of aliases were given by
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Acos(2π(fprin​+kfs​)t+ϕ)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Acos(2π(−fprin​+kfs​)t-ϕ)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  That is to say, when you do the -fprin business you have to flip the sign of the phase shift

  I see where the phase shift sign flip comes from now!
