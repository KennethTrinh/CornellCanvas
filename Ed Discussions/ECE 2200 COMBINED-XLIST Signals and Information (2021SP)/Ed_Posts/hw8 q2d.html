  For this question, we are asked to find the IDFT of $\cos{\frac{2\pi k}{5}}$. I'm having trouble understanding what a cosine has to do with the cyclic shift rule. I thought the cyclic shift was about exponentials in the time domain?

  The Cyclic Shift Rule doesn't have to do with any particular kind of $N$-point signals --- it applies to all of them.

  Could you demonstrate how one would use the cyclic shift rule on part (b) to obtain the solution of part d? I'm still having trouble understanding this concept. Thanks!

  Triage: too involved to do right now in this venue with awkward LaTeX.  Sorry.
