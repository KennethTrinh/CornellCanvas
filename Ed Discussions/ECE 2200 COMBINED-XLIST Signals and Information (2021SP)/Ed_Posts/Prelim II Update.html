 I just found out that Prelim II is in 3 days and that it is covering everything we've learned so far because of the Canvas announcement today. I now feel like I have to spend my wellness day studying for the exam, and I am quite anxious because we are usually given a week's notice before big exams. Are there any accommodations for this exam, given the circumstances?

  The date was set at the beginning of the semester and posted on Canvas.  I thought it was a week from tomrrow myself until someone from the class reminded me.   Coverage-wise I think it's fair because the last homework the exam covers was due last Thursday and was available for a week before that.  Given the tight market for room assignments, I can't re-schedule the exam, and I don't think that would be fair anyway because people have been planning on the scheduled date for a while.

  Not sure what to tell you, but please e-mail me what you're thinking when you say "accommodations."

   I realize that I could have looked up the exam date in my syllabus myself. But when I asked on Thursday, I was told to expect an exam around next Tuesday. Because of this, I prioritized the last few days on other classes and my general wellness.

   I recognize that the exam cannot be delayed due to room assignments but I was wondering if the contents of HW VII could be excluded from this exam. Because HW VII answers haven't been released, it is more difficult to review exam material.

    Homework VII solutions will come out tonight or tomorrow, as I mentioned in my e-mail.  Did I tell you on Thursday when we met that the exam was next Tuesday?  Because TBH at that point I thought that was the correct date.

     Yes, that is why I was surprised by the announcement today.
