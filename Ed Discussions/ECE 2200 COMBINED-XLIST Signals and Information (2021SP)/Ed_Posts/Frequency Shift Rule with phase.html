 Does the frequency shift rule still work if the cosine has a phase? I'm thinking of using it in HW3 but the multiplying cosine will have a phase shift.

  You need to be careful with that.  Which problem are we looking at?

   Problem 1 I was going to use the frequency shift rule but its multiplied by a sine so i was going to turn it into cos(24pit+pi/2) and then use the rule.

    Sorry for late reply.  To get the spectrum of $s ( t ) \cos ( 2 \pi f _ o t + \phi )$, proceed as follows: shift the spectrum of $s ( t )$ to the right and left by $f _ o$ (same as when $\phi = 0$), but instead of just multiplying the coefficient labels on the stems by $1 / 2$ and halving the stem heights, multiply the coefficient labels on the right-shifted stems  by $e ^ {j \phi} / 2$ and those of the left-shifted stems by $e ^ {- j \phi}  / 2$.  The stem heights still get halved because $| e ^ {\pm j \phi} | = 1$.  In your case, $\phi = \pi / 2$, so $e ^ {\pm j \phi} = \pm j$.
