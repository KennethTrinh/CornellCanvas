 I was wondering if there was a way to do this question without using MATLAB or other online plotting software. I know itâ€™s going to be a lot tedious doing it by hand, but what is the best approach if we want to do it by hand?

  Look at the series representation for the continuous-time signal.  Look at individual values of $t$, say $0 \leq t &lt; 1$ for example.  You discover that only one or two of the terms in the infinite series determine the value of the continuous-time signal over that $t$-range.  From those terms you can find an explicit expression for the continuous-time signal over that $t$-range,, and from that explicit expression the plot is easy.
