  I'm registered for the in-person section of the Monday lab (Lab 401, Monday 7:30-10:30). However, on the lab schedule, both of the TAs are listed as remote. How does this work? Is there an in-person section?

  Instructors, including TAs, all have the option to do their teaching remotely.  The lab schedule pinned above lists a couple of in-person lab sessions.
