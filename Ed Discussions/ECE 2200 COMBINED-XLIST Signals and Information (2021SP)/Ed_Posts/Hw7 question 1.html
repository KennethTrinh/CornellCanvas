  For part d, I'm a bit confused on what to do once I j plug and Chugg the x[n] into the analysis equation. Do I euler expand it to complex exponentials. As for the graph, I know we did a a very similar example in class but I'm having a bit of trouble kinda just figuring out the graph by simply looking at the synthesis equation.

  Because DTFTs are unique, you can look at the table and see if the form of x[n] matches something on the table in section 7-6, and the rules on the next page.

  The analysis equation (which is I think what you meant) isn't the way to go IMHO.  Matching it up with the similar example from class pays off.  Remember, DTFT is linear.
