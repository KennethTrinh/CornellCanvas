  I saw in the email that the prelim will cover everything we've done so far, so I was wondering if there will be an even spread of topics on the prelim, or will there be a heavy emphasis on the topics we've covered after prelim 1?

  I would say emphasis on material after Prelim I, but obviously the stuff builds on itself, so you need to know e.g. what spectra mean, how to draw them, etc.
