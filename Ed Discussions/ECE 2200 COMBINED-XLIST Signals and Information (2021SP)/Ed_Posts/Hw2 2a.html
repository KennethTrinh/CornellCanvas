  I'd intended to use $b _ l$ instead of $a _ l$ in part (a) to avoid confusion.  In (c), the frequencies of the various terms are multiples of the same $f _ o$ while that's not the case in (a).

  How would we find the domain for L? I understand that one fL will be 40, etc from the spectrum plot, but how does this determine the domain for L? I guess I'm slightly confused about the notation

  How about trying to get the number of stems in the plot to equal the total number of terms in the $l$-sum.
