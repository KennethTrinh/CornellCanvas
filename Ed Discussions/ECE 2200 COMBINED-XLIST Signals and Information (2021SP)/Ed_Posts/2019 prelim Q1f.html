 Hi, I know someone has asked a similar question before, but I'm still confused about why (iii) is true. If y(t) is the principle continuous-time alias of x(t), wouldn't that mean that Ts does not have to be smaller than 1/74?

   y(t) emerges after you go through all of the nonsense of sampling and interpolating, which means that none of your signal was 'lost' and reduced to a lower frequency signal. The only way this is possible is if you initially sampled/interpolated by greater than the Nyquist rate.

    But in hw4 Q4, we calculated the principle c-time alias for the second term of x(t), even though its frequency is bigger than half of the sampling frequency. Could I assume that y(t) in f can also be derived from a term with frequency higher than fs/2 in x(t)?

     Bit confused what you mean, just because the fact that the second term was the same after sampling/interpolating precisely because its frequency was less than fs/2 (200 &lt; 350); the general rule is when you sample- you either are going to end up with the principal continual time alias or the same signal depending on whether or not f_o &lt; fs/2
