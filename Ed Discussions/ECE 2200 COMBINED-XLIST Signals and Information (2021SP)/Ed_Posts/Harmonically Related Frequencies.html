  I think I'm really not understanding something about what it means for signals to be harmonically related, because for any x(t) that is a sum of cosines, couldn't it always be possible for the fundamental frequency to be 1? Or is it that they are essentially not periodic because N would become extremely large if the gcid of the frequencies was 1? Sorry if this is a dumb question.

  No question is "dumb"!  All questions rule!

  Harmonically related means that the ratio of any two of them is a

   rational number

  .  That's restrictive.  For example, $f _ 1 = 1$ and $f _ 2 = \sqrt{2}$ aren't harmonically related frequencies, and the signal

  $x ( t ) = \cos ( 2 \pi t ) + \cos ( 2 \pi ( \sqrt{2} ) t )$

  isn't periodic.  It has nothing to do with $N$, or the number of terms in the summation, or whatever.  It has to do with whether the individual cosine terms are "in sync" with each other.  (Or is it "in synch"?)

  Oh I see thank you! Yeah I got confused because I was looking at the first question on homework 2 and didn't read one of the equations correctly.
