 Hi everyone, just thought I'd mention a common mistake made on homework 1, question 5.  When you write a cosine function as a sum of complex exponentials, make sure to include Re { } surrounding it.  For example:
</p>
<p>
 cos (2*pi*f*t) = e^(j*2*pi*f*t)  is incorrect
</p>
<p>
 cos (2*pi*f*t)  = Re {e^(j*2*pi*f*t) }  is correct!
</p>
<p>
 Good luck on your exam!
</p>
