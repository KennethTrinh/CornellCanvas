  For this one do I expand the inside into a polar form, then find those terms that don't have a j attached to them and set them equal to sqrt(3/2)? Or is there another way to do it.

  That's one way to do it if I understand your question correctly --- i.e. to start by writing $( 1 - j ) e ^ {j \theta}$ in polar form.

  I found a very clever solution by using euler and trig identities, I think you can avoid polar.
