  Part b has an input signal x2[n] = 3 cos(pi*n/4). To solve part a, I found the DTFT, multiplied with with the given H(w) function to get Y(w). Then converted Y(w) to y[n]. I tried to use this approach for part b, but my understanding is that pure sinusoids don't have DTFTs. One approach I was thinking about was putting H(w) into h[n] (convert to time domain) and do the convolution in the time domain but that's a much more complicated calculation. Is there a way to find y[n] while doing the convolution in the frequency domain?

  Recall that $e ^ {j n \widehat{\omega} _ o}$ in means $\widehat{H} ( \widehat{\omega _ o} ) e ^ {j n \widehat{\omega}_ o}$ out.  Euler might help here.
