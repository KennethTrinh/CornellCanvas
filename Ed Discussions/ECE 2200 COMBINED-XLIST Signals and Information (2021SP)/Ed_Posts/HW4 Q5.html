 For this problem, when we ended up with fs = 150Hz, was this valid because 50 &lt; 150/2 ? Similar to HW4 Q4?

  Yeah, when you sample the first term in $x ( t )$ at 150 Hz and put the samples through the ideal D-to-C, it comes out as itself because of that inequality.  Meanwhile, the second term samples to the discrete-time constant signal 1, which comes out of the ideal D-to-C as the continuous-time constant signal 1, which is the principal continuous-time alias of the second term in $x ( t )$ wrt sampling frequency 150 Hz.
