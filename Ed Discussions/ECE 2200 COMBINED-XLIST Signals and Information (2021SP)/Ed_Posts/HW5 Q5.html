 For this part of the question, does it mean that we need to find all the coefficiencts of the fourier series of y(t) without taking integrals?

  I think it's more like, "Maybe you did some integration to find the Fourier coefficients of $x ( t )$.  You can find the Fourier coefficients of $y ( t )$ from those of $x ( t )$ without doing any further integration."
