  If we are asked to write down what comes out of a Ts-sampler when a pure sinusoid goes in, and the normalized radian frequency that we initially calculate is outside of the range 0 to pi, should we find the principal discrete-time alias of x[n], or leave the answer as initially found? I know discrete time aliases are just another way of "spelling" x[n], so perhaps it doesn't matter.

  Depends on on the problem.  I hope instructions for given problems will make it clear when you need to "spell" things a certain way.
