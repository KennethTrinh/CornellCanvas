  I have done the following:
 </paragraph>
 <list style="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    First, I found fs / 2 =  (7π - 9) / 2 = 6.495574
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    Then, I subtracted 7π - (7π - 9) = 9.
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    Leaving the frequency 6 term alone, I found that f0 = gcid(6,9) = 3.
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
 </list>
 <paragraph>
  Although the signal outputted is periodic, I am not sure whether we can use this frequency since 9 &gt; fs / 2 (outside the alpha range). I also done this one more time, getting 9 - (7π - 9) = 18 - 7π = -3.991148575.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  I have also tried 6 - (7π - 9) = 15 - 7π = -6.99114857513 yet it is outside of the case Beta range (&gt; fs / 2 = 6.495574). Should we care whether or not this is inside or outside the Beta range?

  (I don't mean to give out the answer anyway, but I hope this helps everyone else who has a similar dillemma :)

  As I noted, 3(d) has issues.  TA
