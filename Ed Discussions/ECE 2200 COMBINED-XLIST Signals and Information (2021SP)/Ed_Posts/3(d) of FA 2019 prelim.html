 For this question part (d),

 I have done the following:
</p>
<list style="bullet">
 <li>
  <p>
   First, I found fs / 2 =  (7π - 9) / 2 = 6.495574
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Then, I subtracted 7π - (7π - 9) = 9.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Leaving the frequency 6 term alone, I found that f0 = gcid(6,9) = 3.
  </p>
 </li>
</list>
<p>
 Although the signal outputted is periodic, I am not sure whether we can use this frequency since 9 &gt; fs / 2 (outside the alpha range). I also done this one more time, getting 9 - (7π - 9) = 18 - 7π = -3.991148575.
 <break>
 </break>
 <break>
 </break>
 I have also tried 6 - (7π - 9) = 15 - 7π = -6.99114857513 yet it is outside of the case Beta range (&gt; fs / 2 = 6.495574). Should we care whether or not this is inside or outside the Beta range?
</p>
<p>
 (I don't mean to give out the answer anyway, but I hope this helps everyone else who has a similar dillemma :)

  As I noted, 3(d) has issues.  TA

  famously unearthed the error when he took this test.  :-)
