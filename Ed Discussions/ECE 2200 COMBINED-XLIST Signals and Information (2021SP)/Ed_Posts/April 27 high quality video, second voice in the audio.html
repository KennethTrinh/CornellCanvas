  For the first 40ish minutes, there seems to be another voice teaching chemistry (maybe?) in the audio of the high quality recording, but not in the zoom recording . Not sure what can be done at this point but I wanted to let the prof know.

  I don't know what to make of it.  I have no control over these recordings.  Suggested work-around: listen to the Zoom audio on your phone while watching high-res video on your laptop.  :-)
