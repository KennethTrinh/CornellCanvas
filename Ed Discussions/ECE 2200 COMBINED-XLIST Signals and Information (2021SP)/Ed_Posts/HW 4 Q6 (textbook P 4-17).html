  For part a, p(t) is defined from -0.2 to 0.2 inclusive. Because of this range, when I sketched the waveform, some values of t are defined in two separate points. For example, x(.6) = -0.2 and 0.4. Is this ok or did I make a mistake somewhere?

  Yeah, that's okay --- we never care the exact value a signal takes on at a jump.  You could pick one or the other or something else even.
