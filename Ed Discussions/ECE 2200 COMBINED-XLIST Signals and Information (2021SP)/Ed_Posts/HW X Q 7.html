  How does one find the frequency response magnitude for S7? The solutions are able to get an expression with the ratio of two sine functions:

  However, when I tried to work out the problem, I started with the difference equation given, wrote Hhat(omega-hat), factored out e^-j(5/2)w, and ended up with a magnitude consisting of a sum of three cosines:
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  \left|2\cos\left(\frac{5}{2}w\right)+2\cos\left(\frac{3}{2}w\right)+2\cos\left(\frac{1}{2}w\right)\right|
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  Is there a different way to approach finding the frequency response that would produce the Dirichlet form above?

  The Dirichlet thing comes from first doing partial geometric series and then factoring out stuff from the numerator and denominator.  We've done that a bunch of times.
