 How does one find the frequency response magnitude for S7? The solutions are able to get an expression with the ratio of two sine functions:

</figure>
<p>
 However, when I tried to work out the problem, I started with the difference equation given, wrote Hhat(omega-hat), factored out e^-j(5/2)w, and ended up with a magnitude consisting of a sum of three cosines:
</p>
<math>
 \left|2\cos\left(\frac{5}{2}w\right)+2\cos\left(\frac{3}{2}w\right)+2\cos\left(\frac{1}{2}w\right)\right|
</math>
<p>
 Is there a different way to approach finding the frequency response that would produce the Dirichlet form above?
</p>

  The Dirichlet thing comes from first doing partial geometric series and then factoring out stuff from the numerator and denominator.  We've done that a bunch of times.
