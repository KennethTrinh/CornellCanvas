  In the homework 4 solutions, it seems that question 2 and 3 were switched. Also I think the solution for 3a has a typo: the 10 should not be a coefficient of the second term, and it goes away in the next line anyway.

  Also in question 5b, how did you get cos((1.8-2)pi*n when you rewrite cos(1.2pi*n) ? Shouldn't it be cos((1.2-2)pi*n) which then is the same as cos(0.8pi*n) ?
