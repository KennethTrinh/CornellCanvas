 The reasoning in my head is a little fuzzy- is it because the values reflected around -pi/pi are all equal? The math behind it makes sense, but why is the frequency response 2pi periodic in the first place?

  $\widehat{H} ( \widehat{\omega} )$ is defined for all $\widehat{\omega}$, but because it turns out to be a $2 \pi$-periodic function of $\widehat{\omega}$, people customarily graph it only on an interval of length $2 \pi$, which determines what it looks like for all $\widehat{\omega}$ by periodicity. $[ - \pi , \pi ]$ is the usual interval people use, although in a sense the DFT uses $[ 0 , 2 \pi ]$.

   Why is the frequency response periodic though? Is it because signals outside the [-pi,pi] range are aliases?

    Just look at the formula for it in terms of impulse response, namely
   </p>
   <p>
    $\widehat{H} ( \widehat{\omega} ) = \sum _ {n = - \infty} ^ \infty h [ n ] e ^ {- j n \widehat{\omega}}$,
   </p>
   <p>
    and you see that every term in the sum is $2 \pi$-periodic.  BTW for a causal FIR system the sum is finite --- goes fron $n = 0$ to $n = M$ --- and the same reasoning applies.
   </p>

     Sorry if this is obvious but is it because any $e^{jkw}$ is $2\pi$-periodic for $k$ as an integer? Does this same logic also apply if $k$ is not an integer?

      Yes to the first question, no to the second.
