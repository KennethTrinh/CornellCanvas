  Do the TAs want us to fill out
  <bold>
   lab4release.m
  </bold>
  from the github link under the lab assignment and submit that file? Or are we meant to go to a lab section and get checked off like normal by showing the work we did in the lab?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Also, are we allowed to present our lab work in a Word document, for instance, with screenshots?

  You can use `lab4release.m` if you find it helpful, but you don't have to.

  A word document is also fine, just be prepared if you are asked about the details.
