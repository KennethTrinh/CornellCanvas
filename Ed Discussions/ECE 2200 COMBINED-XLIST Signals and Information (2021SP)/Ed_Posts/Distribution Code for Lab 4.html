 Do the TAs want us to fill out
 <b>
  lab4release.m
 </b>
 from the github link under the lab assignment and submit that file? Or are we meant to go to a lab section and get checked off like normal by showing the work we did in the lab?
</p>
<p>
 Also, are we allowed to present our lab work in a Word document, for instance, with screenshots?
</p>

  You can use `lab4release.m` if you find it helpful, but you don't have to.
 </p>
 <p>
  A word document is also fine, just be prepared if you are asked about the details.
