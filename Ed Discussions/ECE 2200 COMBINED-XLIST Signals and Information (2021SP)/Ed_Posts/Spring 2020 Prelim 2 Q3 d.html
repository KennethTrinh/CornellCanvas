 If we found in part c that H(w)=H1(w)H2(w) is zero when w= 2pi/5 and 4pi/5, and then we are given a third H3(w) for part d, we could write this as H(w)=H1(w)H2(w)H3(w), where now within the range of pi/2&lt;=w&lt;pi we know H3(w) is zero. The 4pi/5 is already in this range so we don't need to write it, but the 2pi/5 (.4pi) that causes H1(w)H2(w) to be zero isn't in this range, so why wouldn't the answer be pi/2&lt;=w&lt;pi or w=2pi/5 ?

   Yup, that's right kind of.  But the question asks us to cascade System 1 from (a) with System 3, and that cascade doesn't include the system that kills $2 \pi / 5$.

    Oh I misread it. But if it had asked for all 3 cascaded together, the answer would be pi/2&lt;=w&lt;pi or w=2pi/5 ?
