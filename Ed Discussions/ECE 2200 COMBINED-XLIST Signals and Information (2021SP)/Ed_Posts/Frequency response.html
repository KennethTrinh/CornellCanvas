 It was mentioned in the Loose Ends handout that systems with real frequency responses are non-causal. Why is this the case?

  From the synthesis equation for the DTFT, it turns out that if the frequency response is real-valued, the impulse response $h [ n ]$ satisfies $h [ - n ] = ( h [ n ] ) ^ *$, where $^ *$ denotes complex conjugate.  So if $h [ n ] \neq 0$ for some $n &gt; 0$, we have $h [ - n ] \neq 0$ for some $n &gt; 0$, and the system isn't causal.
 </p>

  The sole exception to this rule: frequency response is a constant, say $c _ o$, in which case $h [ n ] = c _ o \delta [ n ]$.
