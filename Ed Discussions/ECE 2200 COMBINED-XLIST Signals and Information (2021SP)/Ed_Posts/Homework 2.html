 I've received some questions about how I graded question 2 on homework 2 so I checked with Professor Delchamps and I took off too many points for part a for some students.  Setting L = 8 and using a+-5 and a+-8 will be marked as correct.  I will regrade these questions and update the grades in canvas.
