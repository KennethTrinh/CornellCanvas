 <paragraph>
  If I have a constant input signal x[n]=1, and the frequency response at 0 is
 </paragraph>
 <math>
  H\left(0\right)=1\cdot e^{j\varphi}
 </math>
 <paragraph>
  for some non-zero phase, is the output signal
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  y[n]=1 , or
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  y[n] = 1*cos(phi).
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Basically do we take into account phase in the output signal for constant signals?

  If the system has a real-valued impulse response $h [ n ]$, then $\widehat{H} ( 0 )$ will always be a real number.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  However, in general, constant input signal $x [ n ] = 1$ will yield constant output signal
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  $y [ n ] = \widehat{H} ( 0 )$,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  whether that number is real or complex.
