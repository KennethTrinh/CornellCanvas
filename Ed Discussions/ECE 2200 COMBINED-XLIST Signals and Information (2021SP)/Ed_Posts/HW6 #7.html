  For this question, why is x[n]*x[n] = x[n] when you take the convolution of the two y[n]s to get the cascade? When I tried the convolution in Matlab, the result of x[n]*x[n] ended up being very different from x[n]

  You don't convolve the two $y [ n ]$'s to get the difference equation for the cascade.  You convolve the two systems' impulse responses and get the difference equation from that, or you just plug one of the $y [ n ]$'s into the other difference equation in place of $x [ n ]$ everywhere and clean it up.

  Is it not (1-2cos(pi/7)) for x[n-1] and x[n-3]?

  I missed the minus signs on the solution, there's nothing wrong with it.
