 When we have a stem plot with amplitudes which are purely real (like 7) and also amplitudes which have an imaginary part like:
</p>
<math>
 ^{e^{j\frac{\pi}{2}}}
</math>
<p>
 how do we decide which should be higher?

  Remember that if $a$ is the label on.a stem, the stem has length $| a |$.  Thus if $a = 7$, the stem has length 7.  If $a = 7 e ^ {j \theta}$ for some real $\theta$, the stem also has length 7 because
 </p>
 <p>
  $| a | = | 7 e ^ {j \theta} | = 7 | e ^ {j \theta} | = 1$.
 </p>
 <p>
  Remember, $| e ^ {j \theta} | = 1$ for all real $\theta$.
