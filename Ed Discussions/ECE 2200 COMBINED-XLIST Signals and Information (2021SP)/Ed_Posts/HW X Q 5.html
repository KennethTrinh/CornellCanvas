  Here's how I approached this problem.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  $H ( z ) = \frac{z ^ 4 - z ^ 3 + z ^ 2 - z + 1}{z ^ 4}$,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  so we know it has a pole of order 4 at $z = 0$ and four zeros someplace. Plot #5 is the only one that works.  As for actually finding the zeros, there's a formula for zeros of a degree-4 polynomial, but when I did this problem I didn't go there in the solutions.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  One way to check the zeros is to look at the picture and see that it stipulates four zeros on the unit circle, i.e. four values of $\widehat{\omega}$ satisfying
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  $\sum _ {k = 0} ^ 4 \left ( - e ^ {j \widehat{\omega}} \right ) ^ k = 0$.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  You can use the partial geometric series and usual messing around to turn this into
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  $\frac{\cos ( 5 \widehat{\omega} / 2 )}{\cos ( \widehat{\omega} / 2 )} = 0$,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  so $\widehat{\omega}$ is $\pm \pi / 5$ and $\pm 3 \pi / 5$ (keeping it between $- \pi$ and $\pi$), and that matches the picture.
