  Bit of a nit-picky thing, but should the stems for F(3) and F(-3) be 5/2 instead of 5?

  Not nit-picky, important --- and I thought I'd fixed it after someone else had pointed it out to me.  I'll do it as soon as I can.

  Yeah, and I just "fixed" those diagrams on Thursday.  I think my problem with the pictures this year is that I'm rushing through them because I have to scan them in Rhodes and I haven't been spending a lot of time hanging out at the office (kinda sad when nobody's around).
