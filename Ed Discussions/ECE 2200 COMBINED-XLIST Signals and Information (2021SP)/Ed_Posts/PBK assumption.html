 Are we allowed to have f0 be a negative frequency, as long as it is not -fs / 2, -3fs/2, etc., and then step UP until we reach case alpha or case Beta? In class, it said to step down. I'm thinking yes, but I just wanted to make sure.

  In what context do you mean "allowed to"?  In this course, the standard form of a pure sinusoid is $A \cos ( 2 \pi f _ o t + \phi )$ with $f _ o \geq 0$.  You can always put it in that form.  For example, $\cos ( 2 \pi ( - 3 ) t + \pi / 7 ) = \cos ( 2 \pi ( 3 ) t - \pi / 7 )$.  When I discussed principal continuous-time aliases and the recipe for finding the principal one, I assumed $f _ o \geq 0$.
