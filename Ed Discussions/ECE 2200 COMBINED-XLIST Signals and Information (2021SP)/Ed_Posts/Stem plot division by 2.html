  When we draw the stem plot, I've noticed that we had to divide the amplitudes by 2. I just wanted to make sure, is this division by 2 because of Euler's formula where cos(t) = (e^(jt)+e^(-jt))/2? Or do we have to always divide by 2 whenever we plot something on the stem plot?

  It's because of Euler.  You can think of each stem as corresponding to a single complex-exponential term.
