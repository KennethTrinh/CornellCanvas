  For parts a and b, is the best approach to solve the quadratic on the denominator? I'm not sure how that would help, though. I'm also not sure where the table of z transforms is in the book or if that would be useful for this question?

  You need to factor the denominator to get poles, and that enables the partial-fractions thing, but maybe wait until the handout about the latter procedure to see what's going on.
