  I was able to apply the lecture example to do question 4 I think, but without the hint of using the cyclic rule, I don't think I would've figured this out. I'm a little confused how the math would get us to this conclusion?

  Cyclic Shift Rule gives $y [ n ]$ as a cyclic shift of $x [ n ]$.  I'll leave it at that.
