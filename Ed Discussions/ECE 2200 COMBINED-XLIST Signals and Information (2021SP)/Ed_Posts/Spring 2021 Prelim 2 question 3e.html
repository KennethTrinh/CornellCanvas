  I understand finding the frequency response of System 4 in this question, but I am a bit lost when finding the new amplitude and phase. Where did the pi/4 term come from in the new amplitude? Also, i'm not sure where each of the terms in the new phase came from.

  The $\pi / 4$ in the magnitude comes from System 2.

  The first term in the phase comes from System 1 and the second and third terms come from System 4.  System 2 contributes no phase.
