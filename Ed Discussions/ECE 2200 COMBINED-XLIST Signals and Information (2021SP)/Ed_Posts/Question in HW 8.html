  For part d, the DFT of X can be considered like a cyclic time shift rule with two time delays with n0 = -2 and n0 = 2 on the delta function, but since it would be a cyclic timeshift it would have to be x[&lt;n - n0&gt;_N] for the one where n0 = -2 it would be x[n+2] but why is it written as n-8 instead of n+2. Firstly, how does n+2 become n-8 and is one way the right way while the other one wrong.

  The way I do the $N$-point Cyclic Shift Rule requires $n _ o$ to satisfy $0 \leq n _ o &lt; N$.  The specifications "when $n = 8$" and "when $n \neq 8$" pre-suppose $0 \leq n &lt; 10$.  Note that the thing equals 1 not only when  $n = 8$ but also when $\langle n \rangle _ {10} = 8$, but the only one of those $n$-values that "counts" in the world of 10-point signals is $n = 8$.
