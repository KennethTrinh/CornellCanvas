  Beginning of next week.  Three out of four problems have been graded, and the last will come in soon, but I'm out of town starting tomorrow afternoon until Sunday evening, so even if the last problem comes in tomorrow I won't be able to post the scores until Sunday night at the earliest.  Sorry for the delay!
