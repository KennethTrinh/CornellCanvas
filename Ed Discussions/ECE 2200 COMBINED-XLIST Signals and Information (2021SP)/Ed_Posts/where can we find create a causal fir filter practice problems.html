 Would you recommend looking at some of the unassigned problems in chapter 7?

  About the only such problem we've considered is the "kill one frequency" thing.  Do you have other such problems in mind?

   I was thinking about the type of problem we did in the 4-22 lecture: taking an ideal bandpass filter and converting it into a causal FIR filter by doing the shift and windowing. I recall in lecture we did the shifting, but we said the result of windowing was some $A(\hat{\omega})$ multiplied by the desired frequency response.
  </p>
  <p>
   Since we did not see this explicitly or with numbers, I was wondering where I could get some practice problems on how to calculate $A(\hat{\omega})$ after windowing?

    To have there even be an $A ( \widehat{\omega} )$, the FIR system's impulse response has to have one of a few symmetries.  The one I considered in class is where it has odd length and is symmetric about its midpoint.  This stuff is pretty much beyond the scope of ECE 2200.
