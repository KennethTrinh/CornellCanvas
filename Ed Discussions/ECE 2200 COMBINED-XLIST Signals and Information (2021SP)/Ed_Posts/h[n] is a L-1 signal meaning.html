  $h [ n ]$ is an $l ^ 1$ signal means $\sum _ {n = - \infty} ^ \infty | h [ n ] |$ converges --- i.e. $h [ n ]$ is what people call an absolutely summable signal.  In the context where $h [ n ]$ is the impulse response of a causal LTI system, the sum runs only from 0 to $\infty$ because $h [ n ] = 0$ for $n &lt; 0$.
