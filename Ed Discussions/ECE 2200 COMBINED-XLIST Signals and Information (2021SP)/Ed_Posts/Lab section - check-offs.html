  I know this might be a "stupid" question. If I go to another lab section other than my assigned one (before my assigned one), and get it checked off, I don't have to go to my assigned lab section, right?

  Can you go to a later lab section? ie if I have a Tuesday lab section can I get mine checked off on Thursday?
