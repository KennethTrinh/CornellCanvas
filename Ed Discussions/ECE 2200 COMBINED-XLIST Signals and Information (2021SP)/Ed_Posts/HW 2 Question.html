  Can someone explain why the basic fact apply to part c since when i actually do the integration it does not equal 0.

  Check your integration and remember that $e ^ {j m 2 \pi} = 1$ for all integers $M$.

  Then how come for part c it wasn't 0 as well since the only thing that changed between these two was the coefficient in the front and part c did not yield a 0.

  $\int _ 0 ^ 5 37 e ^ {- j k 2 \pi / 5} t d t = \frac{37}{j k 2 \pi} \left ( e ^ {- j k 2 \pi} - 1 \right ) = 0$

  when $k \neq 0$.

  Maybe I misunderstand your question?

  So this was something I also asked after class, but essentially, this is how it applies:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  When you're finding the a_k, you the integral of (x(t) - 37)*e^stuff. This distributes to be x(t)*e^stuff and 37*e^stuff. From class, we know that the integral over T_0 of e^stuff is 0; and we can just pull out a constant from integration; resulting in the integral of 37*e^stuff = 0. Therefore, you're just left with the integral over T_0 of x(t)*e^stuff-- identical to our original x(t) a_k.

  I don't know how to do mathematical symbols and at this point, I'm scared to ask. Hope this helped.
