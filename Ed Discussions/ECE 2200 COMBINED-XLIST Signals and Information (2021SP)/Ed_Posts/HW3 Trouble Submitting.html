  When I try to submit homework 3, it gives me an error saying it needs to be a pdf or a zip (which my file was). I know another person was having this issue as well. Is there a reason for this?

  Hmm, I enabled zip as well as pdf.  I wonder what the issue is.  I just tried enabling again.  If that doesn't work, you can e-mail me the .zip and I can forward it to the TAs.

  I made sure to export as pdf, not sure if I am doing something wrong.

  Try it now.  I comma-separated the permitted file types to see whether that helps.
