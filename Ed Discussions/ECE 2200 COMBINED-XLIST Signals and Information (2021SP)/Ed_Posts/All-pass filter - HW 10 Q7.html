 What does it mean for a system to be all-pass? I'm not sure how to know that system 2 in this question is an all-all pass system from its frequency response H(z).

  A system is all-pass just means its frequency response magnitude $\widehat{H} ( \widehat{\omega} )$ is a constant function of $\widehat{\omega}$.
