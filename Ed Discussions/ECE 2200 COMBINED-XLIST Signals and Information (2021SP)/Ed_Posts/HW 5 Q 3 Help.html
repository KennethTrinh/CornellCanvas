 I'm not entirely sure how to approach part a of this question. Would I expand whats in there and then try to form it in the way of y[n] = H(w)e^jnw. Or would  I rewrite the entire thing in terms of cosines? I'm not really sure what to do here.

  I'd say expand what's there and get an expression for $\widehat{H} ( \widehat{\omega} )$ as a sum of terms.  Then keep in mind my comment at the beginning of my answer in #277 --- this will give you the difference equation relating $x [ n ]$ and $y [ n ]$, which helps with (a) and (b).  For (c), I think it's easier to work with the original (product of terms)  expression for the frequency response.
