  I'm not sure how to determine more than two equations (the imaginary and the real part of y[n]) because we haven't done an example with M&gt;2. Does anyone have any insight on how to produce more equations/relationships for bk?

  Suggestion: as in lecture, cascade systems each of which kills one frequency.

  I'm also confused on this question. I understand that one of the systems being 0 kills the whole system so we can split it up. Are we determining four equations for the pi/3 case and four more for the pi/7 case? Or do we find four equations: two from the pi/3 case and two from the pi/7 case for a grand total of four?

  In lecture Tuesday, we  showed how to kill one frequency.  Have you seen that?

  Yes, I have watched the lecture. My understanding of the example with M=2 is that the number of equations needed to determine the bk's is two because of M, which we do by finding the real and imaginary parts of the function. I'm confused how to find two more equations for M=4 beyond the ones from the real and imaginary parts like we solved in the example in class. Or, on the other hand, do we find two equations (from the real and imaginary parts) for pi/3 and then two more equations (from the real and imaginary parts) for pi/7 to determine four total equations. I guess my overall question is are the bk's the same for pi/3 and pi/7 or do they each have their own set that need to be determined individually?

  By my first comment, I meant for you to build two $M = 2$ systems, one to kill each frequency, and cascade them --- that gives you a system that kills both frequencies.  You know the impulse responses of the two individual systems, and the impulse response of their cascade is easy to figure out from those.

  Thank you so much. That clears everything up, and I understand now. I appreciate all your help with this question.
