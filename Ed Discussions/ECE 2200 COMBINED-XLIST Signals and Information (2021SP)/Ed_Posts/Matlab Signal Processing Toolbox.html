  Do we need to have the Signal Processing Toolbox installed in Matlab? I tried to test out the sawtooth(t) function referenced in HW3 Q4b but it says I need the Signal Processing Toolbox to use that function. When I tried to install the toolbox, I get a message saying "Your administrator has restricted your download access to this MathWorks product." I am wondering whether this will be needed throughout the semester, and if so, how to install it? Thank you!

  I haven't encountered this problem before, and here's a possible solution I found on the Internet (not sure whether it will work in your environment, though):

  Admittedly, issues regarding the Matlab installation or bugs specific to your OS are out of the scope, so we may not have answers as well.

  If this doesn't solve the problem, I think for this specific HW question you can still solve it without using Matlab. And I think this toolbox is not essential, but let's see.

  Thank you! Using the instructions at that link worked for me. In case anyone else is having this issue, go to the link above. Basically, it involves rerunning the matlab installer .exe file and selecting the option for the Signal Processing Toolbox at a certain step of the wizard before the install runs. For some reason installing it after while running matlab doen't work.
