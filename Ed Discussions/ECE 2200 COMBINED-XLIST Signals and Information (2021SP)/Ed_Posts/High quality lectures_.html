  Do we know when the next set of high-quality lectures will be made available? Also what is the time frame we should expect for these to uploaded?

  I'll upload a couple tonight.  It depends on (a) when the chemistry IT guys share them to me on Box (which varies) and (b) when I get around to the multi-step process of sharing them on Canvas (also varies).  The more you remind me, the faster I'll do it subject to (a).  Please feel free to prod.
