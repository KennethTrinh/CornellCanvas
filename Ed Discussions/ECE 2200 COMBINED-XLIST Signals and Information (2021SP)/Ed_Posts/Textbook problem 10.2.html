  For this question, they solved for Y(z)/X(z) and said that was H(z), and then converted this back into h[n]. How come we couldn't just say h[n]=.9(h[n-1]-h[n-2])+delta[n-1]? I see that it wouldn't give you the same answer as finding H(z) and then converting, but I'm just confused as to why it wouldn't work

  And just in general, if we are given an impulse response h[n], we can always get the y[n] by plugging in y[n] for h[n] and x[n] for delta[n], but I get it can't be the other way around when its recursive? I feel like in the past I've been given y[n] and plugged in h[n] and it worked, but doing chapter 10 problems, it seems this doesn't work?

  To your question in the first paragraph, Yes!  it would work.

  And unfortunately I don't understand the questions(s) in your second paragraph.  :-\

  But when I plugged in h[n] for y[n] and delta[n] for x[n], it gave me a much different answer than when I used Y(z) and X(z) to get H(z)

  It should give the same answer.

  Remember that the $z$-transform of $\delta [ n - 1]$ is $z ^ {-1}$.
