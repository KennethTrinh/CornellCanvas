 For this question, they solved for Y(z)/X(z) and said that was H(z), and then converted this back into h[n]. How come we couldn't just say h[n]=.9(h[n-1]-h[n-2])+delta[n-1]? I see that it wouldn't give you the same answer as finding H(z) and then converting, but I'm just confused as to why it wouldn't work
</p>
<p>
 And just in general, if we are given an impulse response h[n], we can always get the y[n] by plugging in y[n] for h[n] and x[n] for delta[n], but I get it can't be the other way around when its recursive? I feel like in the past I've been given y[n] and plugged in h[n] and it worked, but doing chapter 10 problems, it seems this doesn't work?

  To your question in the first paragraph, Yes!  it would work.
 </p>
 <p>
  And unfortunately I don't understand the questions(s) in your second paragraph.  :-\

   But when I plugged in h[n] for y[n] and delta[n] for x[n], it gave me a much different answer than when I used Y(z) and X(z) to get H(z)

    It should give the same answer.
   </p>
   <p>
    Remember that the $z$-transform of $\delta [ n - 1]$ is $z ^ {-1}$.
