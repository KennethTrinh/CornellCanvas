<p>
 Do we have to attach our MATLAB plot screenshots with our homework submission? Also is there something wrong in this code for part 3a:
</p>
<pre>w = 0:0.1:2*pi;
X = sin(5*w/2) / (sin(w/2) );

figure
plot (w, X);
</pre>
<p>
 For some reason, the figure does not show a plot unless I multiply X with the e^-j2w term. Am I doing something wrong here? Thank you in advance!
</p>
