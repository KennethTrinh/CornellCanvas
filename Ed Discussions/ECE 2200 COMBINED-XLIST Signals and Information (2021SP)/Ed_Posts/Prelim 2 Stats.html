  I'm a bit concerned about my prelim 2 grade and was wondering what the overall prelim 2 stats were for the class. What cutoff should we be concerned with in regards to passing the class?

  On Prelim II, mean was 73.98, sigma was 17.71, median was 74.  Some people got 100, some people got in the 30's.  The number of low scores puzzled and worried me.

  Not sure how the cutoffs will work out in the end, but you can be fairly sure that a final average below 50 won't pass the course.
