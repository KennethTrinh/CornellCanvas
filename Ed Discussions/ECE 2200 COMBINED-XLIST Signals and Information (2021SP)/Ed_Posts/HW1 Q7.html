  For this problem, I converted the equation to a rectangular form answer and then converted that to exponential form to make the spectrum bar graph, but I'm not sure how to find the frequency. Is there a way to find frequency from either the rectangular or exponential forms?

  Not sure I understand your question.  A term of the form $A \cos ( 2 \pi f _ o t + \phi )$ has frequency $f _ o$.

  oh, were we supposed to graph y(t) with multiple spectrum components or with only one?

  You don't have to graph $y ( t )$.  You just need to find its spectrum in (a) and write it as the sum of cosines in (b).  Its spectrum will have multiple stems in the plot, I think.
