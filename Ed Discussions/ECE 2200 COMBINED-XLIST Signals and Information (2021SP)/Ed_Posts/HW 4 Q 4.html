  How should I approach this problem? I am stuck trying to sketch the spectrum lines of x[n].

  For this problem, you don't need to sketch the spectral lines for $x [ n ]$ (although you could do it that way ---- and I'd hoped to have covered spectra of discrete-time sinusoids in class this week but fell just short).   The cleanest way to do the problem is to use what I called the key picture at the beginning of Thursday's lecture.  Let me know if you need further guidance on this.

  Can you elaborate on how the key picture applies to this case where we're sampling below the Nyquist frequency?

  The key picture says that $y ( t )$, the output of the D/C, is always the principal continuous-time alias of the input $x ( t )$ wrt the sampling frequency $f _ s$.  If $f _ s$ happens to exceed the Nyquist rate of $x ( t )$, then $x ( t )$ is its own principal continuous-time alias wrt $f _s$, whereby $y ( t ) = x ( t )$.
