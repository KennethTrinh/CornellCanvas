  In class, we learned about the zero-order hold interpolation of x(t) as a possible pulse shape for a Ts-interpolator. I have written in my notes that for this pulse, p(t) = 1 for 0&lt;=t&lt;1 and p(t) = 0 otherwise. However, the drawing that was also on the board  shows p(t) as having the value 1 for 0&lt;=t&lt;Ts. Over what range is p(t) equal to 1?

  Yeah, the interval of 1-ness is $[ 0 , T _ s )$.  Sorry about the chalk typo.
