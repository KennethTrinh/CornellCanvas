 We talked in lecture about the user choices involved in creating a short-time DFT for a spectrogram. For the parameter N, we said it was a positive integer for which a larger N would be better but also more computationally demanding. I know we then take the N-point DFT, but I'm still a little confused as to what N represents. Is this a different N than the length of the signal x[n]?
</p>
<p>
 My current understanding is that we have a signal of length N x[n], then we find times n_s and at each one take a segment of x[n] of length L. We zero-pad each segment of length L to be length N (same as the original signal) and then take the N-point DFT. Is that correct?

 Thank you!

  $N$ has nothing to do with the length of $x [ n ]$.  Larger $N$ just means that the DFT you take of the $L$-point signal in the window starting at time $n _ s$ is a denser sampling of the DTFT of that $L$-point signal, giving you a finer array of points in the $k$-direction of the spectrogram.
