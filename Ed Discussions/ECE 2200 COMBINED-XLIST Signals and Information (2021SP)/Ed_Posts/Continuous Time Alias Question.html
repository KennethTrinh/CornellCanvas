  In the 3/16 lecture, the formula for an alias in case alpha was stated to be A*cos(2*pi*(-fprin +k*fs) - phi), but when we did the example from the photo there was another alias equation with a positive fprin and phi. I was wondering how we got the second equation and when to use either since wouldn't a number like m=1 satisfy both m&gt;=0 and m&gt;0?

  Could you give me a time stamp for the formula at issue?  I think maybe you're referring to the fact that in Case $\alpha$
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  $A \cos ( 2 \pi ( - f _ {\rm prin} + m f _ s ) t - \phi )$
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  is an alias of $x ( t )$ wrt $f _ s$ for all integers $m &gt; 0$.

  Sorry, I realized my question was a bit unclear (especially what I meant by the second equation). I meant how did we get the 7*cos(2*pi(3+8m)t + phi) equation from the Acos(2π(−fprin​+mfs​)t−ϕ) equation and when do we know when to use 7*cos(2*pi(-3+8m)t - phi) and 7*cos(2*pi(3+8m)t + phi)?

  Could you give us the equation for the case b?

  The timestamp is around the 1-hour mark in the higher quality recording of the 3/16 lecture
