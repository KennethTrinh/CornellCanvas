 If I have an expression H(w) and the input signal x[n] = delta[n], what should I plug in as w to get the frequency response?

  Since the impulse isn't a sinusoid, you can't find the impulse response $h [ n ]$ by plugging something into the frequency response.  For a suggestion on how to find $h  n ]$ from $\widehat{H} ( \widehat{\omega} )$, see #277.
