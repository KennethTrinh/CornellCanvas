 I'm confused why none of the answers for c are correct. Based on the frequency spectrum, I found x(t) = 3+cos(2pi*2t - pi/2) + 2/sqrt(2) * cos(2pi*5t + pi/4). Wouldn't this mean that x(0) = 4, that x(t) is periodic, and that x(17) = x(3)?

  The solution to (c) is missing for some reason.  I wrote it in an earlier thread.  I'll find it when back at a computer.
