 Hi, I am still confused how to take a convolution of two different functions. I am having trouble on HW 5 Q 5 b) because of this and I haven't found a good explanation in lecture or the textbook. Could you give an example of calculating a convolution?

  I would suggest not doing this problem using convolutions but instead just figuring out by hand what the impulse response of the composite system is by using $\delta [ n ]$ as input signal and seeing what signal emerges from the first system, then plugging that into the I/O formula for the second system, etc., until you hit the output of the composite system.
