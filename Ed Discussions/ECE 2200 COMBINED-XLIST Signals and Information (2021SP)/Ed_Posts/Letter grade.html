 When will the letter grade be released? Will it be posted on canvas? Thanks in advance.

  Apologies for the late reply --- I answered this a couple hours ago from my office desktop, but apparently Ed doesn't accept posts from that computer's Firefox client.  No idea why.

  In any event, I uploaded final grades last night and expected them to have appeared by now.  This is on StudentCenter, not Canvas.
