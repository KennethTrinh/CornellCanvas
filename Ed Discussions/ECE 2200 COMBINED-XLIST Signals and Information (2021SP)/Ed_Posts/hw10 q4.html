 Is there an easier way to see this relationship (factoring out 20e^jw)? I stared at it for a while but I'm not sure I could replicate it given a different problem. Is there a rule for what to factor out so we get a conjugate pair division with magnitude 1? Thanks!

  LOL only because this exact calculation trick has bugged me for so long.  I always forget how to do it, struggle with it for a few minutes, then the light bulb comes on.  So the short answer to your question is: if there's an easier way to do it, I don't know it.
