  I was wondering if the prelim grades will be released before the drop deadline tomorrow?

  Does the drop deadline extend to midnight tomorrow night?  If so, there's a chance I'd have Prelim I grades ready in time.

  That said, in the (I hope unlikely) event that anyone wants to drop the course based on Prelim I grade, I will support any petition to do so without a W shortly after prelim grades come out.  The College of Engineering has responded reasonably in cases such as this in the past.
