 is there a way I could bump up the quality of the video when watching zoom recordings?

  Not on Zoom, but the CHEM IT guys have shared higher-res recordings with me on Box.  It's a bit tedious to make them available, but now that I know there's a market, I have motivation.

   I just started a new Canvas module for higher-resolution lecture videos.  The lecture video from Tuesday 16 March is there now.  It took about an hour to complete the full process (download from Box to my computer, upload from there to Kaltura, Kaltura processing --- middle step took the longest).  If people like the quality, I'll upload the rest and keep it up for the rest of the semester.  Let me know what you think.
