  My spectrogram function is giving me a had time.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I have the line of code
  <code>
   [S,F,T] = spectrogram(resampledSong,window,noverlap,nfft,Fs);
  </code>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  where
 </paragraph>
 <pre>resampledSong = resample(y, 8000, 44100);
window = 64; 
nfft = 64;  
Fs = 8000;  
noverlap = floor( (window * Fs) /2);
</pre>
 <paragraph>
  Specifically the error that I am getting is:
 </paragraph>
 <pre>Error using pspectrogram&gt;chkinput (line 158)
X must be a vector (either row or column).

Error in pspectrogram (line 33)
chkinput(xw,'X');

Error in spectrogram (line 191)
  [varargout{1:nargout}] = pspectrogram({x},'spect',inpArgs{:});
 </pre>

  Try using the new sampling frequency,
  <code>
   new_Fs
  </code>
  rather than
  <code>
   Fs
  </code>
  in:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <code>
   [S,F,T] = spectrogram(resampledSong,window,noverlap,nfft,Fs);
  </code>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Also make sure you are scaling window, nfft, and noverlap correctly. The lab instructions should help with this.

  Yes I did all of that. I added my code above, does any of it seem wrong?

  In the code above, the values you are using are not the same as what the lab instructions specify. From page 3 of Shazam_Part_I_2020.pdf:

  How can you scale these values to get integers? Another way to think about it is, how can you get rid of the units of "s", and get a unit-less value that you would expect for each of these?
