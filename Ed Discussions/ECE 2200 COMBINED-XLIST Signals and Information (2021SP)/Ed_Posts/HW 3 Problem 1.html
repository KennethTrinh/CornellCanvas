 For this problem, why don't we have anything at f = +/- 12? I may have gotten something different.

  We do have terms at $f = \pm 12$, and the written solution features those right at the start, but for some reason I didn't draw stems for them,  Will fix when I can.  The diagrams are harder to fix because I have to be in Rhodes, so it always takes a day or two.  My apologies.
