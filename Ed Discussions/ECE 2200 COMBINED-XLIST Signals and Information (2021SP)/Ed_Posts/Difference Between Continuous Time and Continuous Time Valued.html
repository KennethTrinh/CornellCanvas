  Today in lecture (during the .mp3 example), the prof described a signal as both continuous time and continuous time valued. What is the difference between these two things? My understanding is that the input is CT and the output is CT, but I'm not sure.

  The phrase is "continuous-time and continuous-valued," meaning the
  <italic>
   domain
  </italic>
  is continuous and so is the
  <italic>
   range
  </italic>
  .  For example, $x ( t ) = 3 \cos (2 \pi t )$ is a continuous-time continuous-valued signal, while the signal $x [ n ] = 3 \cos ( 2 \pi n T _ s )$ is discrete-time continuous valued and this signal: $x ( t ) = 0$ on intervals of the form $k \leq t &lt; k + 1$ when $k$ is even and $x ( t ) = 1$ on intervals of that form when $k$ is odd is continuous-time discrete-valued.  Graph that last signal vs. $t$ -- it looks like a square wave, but if you think of its value set as $\{ 0 , 1 \}$ you see that it's discrete-valued.
