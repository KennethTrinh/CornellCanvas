 For Q5 part b, I don't understand how to approach this. If I just plug into the sum, I have a sum with a transient response where we add up all the bk's up to bn, until we reach n = 14 where it is just the sum of all the bk's. But when I look at it with the frequency response, I have H(w) = 0 for n &lt; 0 since it is just the zero signal, and then for n â‰¥ 0, I have my answer from part a. I seem to be missing the transient part with the sum when I do it this way. Am I doing something wrong here? Also, what does n = 23 have to do with this?

  $23 &gt; 14$ is what 23 has to do with it.  I'm scratching my head trying to interpret a couple of other things you wrote, e.g. "H(w) = 0 for n &lt; 0."

   I guess I am just confused about how this problem changes when we add the unit step. I think the frequency response now depends on what n is, and thus the answer will depend on n (y[n] is piecewise). And then when you plug into the summation, there is the 3 part piecewise we discussed in class with 0, a transient part, then steady-state. Am I on the right path here?

    Yeah, this problem is all about transient vs. steady-state.  The frequency response, which is a property of the
    <i>
     system
    </i>
    , doesn't change when you alter the
    <i>
     input
    </i>
    to the system.  What changes is the
    <i>
     output
    </i>
    of the system.  The piecewise thing you refer to tells you that when you use a sinusoid starting at 0, i.e. when you insert the unit step, the resulting output $y [ n ]$ is zero for $n &lt; 0$, then goes through a transient epoch, then for $n &gt; M$ is exactly what it would have been if you'd used a "forever sinusoid" as input.  Your expression for that last piece will involve the frequency response.
