 Is BIBO stability a concept that refers to only casual IIR systems, or can other types of LTI systems be BIBO stable?

  We've restricted it to causal systems, but it generalizes to arbitrary LTI systems.  We kept it causal because we wanted to make sense of the recursive difference equations, etc.
