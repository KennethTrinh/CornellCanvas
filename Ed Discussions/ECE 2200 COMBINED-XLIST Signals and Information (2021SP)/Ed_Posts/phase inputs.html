  We solved the general form of the output to a pure frequency input:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  $$e^{jnw_0} \Longrightarrow \lVert H(w_0) \rVert e^{jnw_0} e^{\angle H(w_0)}$$
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  But what if the input had a phase, i.e. $$e^{jnw_0 + \phi_0}$$
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Perhaps I just missed this in lecture, but what would the corresponding output frequency response be?

  The phase just adds.  One way to see this is linearity:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  $e ^ {j ( \widehat{\omega} _ o + \phi )} = e ^ {j \phi} e ^ {j \widehat{\omega _ o}}$
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  and you can think of the leading factor just as a multiplicative constant on the input.
