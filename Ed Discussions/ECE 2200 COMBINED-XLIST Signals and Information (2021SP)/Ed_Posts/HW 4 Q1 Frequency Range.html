  I'm kind of confused about what this question is asking. So we want to find 3 pure sinusoids whose principle CT alias has a frequency of 440Hz. And the sampling frequency is set to 900Hz. So, you want to solve x -900k = 440 where k is an int. So x= 440, 1340, 2240, etc, but we're given the limit of 1500Hz. Am I misunderstanding the question or do I not understand principle CT alias?

  This is one of the problems part of which depends on Tuesday's lecture, where we talk about finding all the continuous-time aliases of a sinusoid w.r.t. a given sampling frequency.  For now, see whether this helps: $\cos ( 2 \pi ( f _ o - k 900 ) t + \phi )$ samples the same as $\cos ( 2 \pi f _ o t + \phi )$ even when $f _ o - k 900 &lt; 0$.  Also, remember that $\cos ( - \theta ) = \cos \theta$ for all real $\theta$.
