 Would it be possible to upload the high quality versions of the more recent lectures (i.e. 3/18 and on)? It would help a ton with my review. Thanks!

  I checked over the weekend and chemistry hadn't uploaded anything after the 16th yet.  I'll check again tonight.  If necessary, I'll nudge them, but they're doing this out of the goodness of their hearts, so I don't wanna push too hard.  :-)

   Just checked and more have appeared, so I'll get on it.  One in process now.

     Ugh, I always forget how slow the upload {my computer} ---&gt; Kaltura is.  Maybe on campus it would be faster ....
