  I was reviewing the frequency shift rule and thought it would be good to try it with variables instead of numbers to account for the most general case.  Is this diagram correct based on the given x(t) at the top? (The red parts are just to remind me that they are easily forgettable)

  Mostly right, but ...
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  = The left $f$-axis labels need to be $- ( f _ 1 + f _ 2 )$, $- f _ 2$, and $- ( f _ 2 - f _ 1 )$.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  = Two of the stem labels are off.  The one at $f _ 2 - f _ 1$ should be $( A _ 1 A _ 2 / 4 ) e ^ {j ( \phi _ 2 -\phi _ 1} )$ and the one at $- ( f _ 2 - f _ 1 )$ needs to be the complex conjugate of that.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  When the $f _ 2$ cosine has phase, I always have to go full Euler on it --- using frequency-shift always scares me in those cases.

  Did you mean that the phases should be subtracted or they have to be equal?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I also always go full Euler on it but I figured that there must be a better way so I am trying to figure it out.

  Yeah, I meant $-$ not $=$.  Just fixed it.
