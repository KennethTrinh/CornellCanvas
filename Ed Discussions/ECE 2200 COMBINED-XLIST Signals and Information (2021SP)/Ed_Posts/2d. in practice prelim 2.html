  Just to confirm, should the answer in 2d. be 15cos, not 5cos since x[n] is the same as what it was in 2c?

  Correct.  BTW it's not technically a practice prelim, it's last spring's Prelim II.  (Pet peeve of mine.)

  And the reasoning here is that it will reach steady state when n&gt;=9? Because it will be 5+length of impulse response? And what we found in part c is already the steady state response for when there's no unit shift on that signal?

  Yeah, that's a solid way to view it.

  Wouldn't it be n&gt;= 10 when the steady state response is reached then? Since the length of the sliding window is 5 and the length of the impulse response is also 5 (running from n=0 to n=4)? Because at time 9 the sliding window hasn't completely slid past time 5

  Steady-state starts when the left end of the window sits on time 5.  I think that means it starts at time 9.
