 I am going to have to change my office hour times for the foreseeable future, but given that the exam is scheduled for the 25th, how would students feel about concatenating all my four office hours into one review session? I don't believe I can make a poll here so responses are appreciated. Thank you!

  Ok, this upcoming Monday (24th) I will host Office Hours from 1:30PM to 4:30PM to make up for the office hours missed this past Monday and tomorrow. Feel free to come and ask any questions about the course material!
