 I am confused about why y[0] only needs one MAC operation. As y[n]=h[n]*x[n] and h[n] is a 1024-point signal, would y[n] be a summation from k=0 to k=1023 and then make y[1] needs 1024 MAC operation? Thanks in advance.

  It might help you see what's going on to look at the convolution of a 4-point signal with a 5-point signal.  Suffice it to say that when $x [ n ] = 0$ for $n &lt; 0$, the ostensibly infinite sum
 </p>
 <p>
  $\sum _ {k =  0} ^ \infty h [ k ] x [ n - k ]$
 </p>
 <p>
  has at most one nonzero term, namely $h [ 0 ] x [ 0 ]$.  And when $n = 1$ the sum has at most two nonzero terms ---- it equals $h [ 0 ] x [ 1 ] + h [ 1 ] x [ 0 ]$.  Etc.
