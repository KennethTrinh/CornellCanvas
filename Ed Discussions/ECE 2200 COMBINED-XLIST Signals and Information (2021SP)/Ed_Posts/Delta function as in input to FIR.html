 Is this covered in the textbook? It's in HW6.6 so I assume it is, but can't seem to find it. If so, does anyone have the page number(s)?

  The way we did it in class: say the FIR system's I/O relationship is
 </p>
 <p>
  $y [ n ] = \sum _ {k = 0} ^ M b _ k x [ n - k ]$.
 </p>
 <p>
  Let the input be a $\delta$ and the output that arises we call the system's impulse response and denote it $h [ n ]$.
 </p>
 <p>
  $h [ n ] = \sum _ {k = 0} ^ M b _ k \delta [ n - k ]$.
 </p>
 <p>
  For $n &lt; 0$ and $n &gt; M$, all terms on the right are zero.  When $0 \leq n \leq M$, the $k = n$-term is $b _ n$ and the rest are zero.  Accordingly
 </p>
 <p>
  $h [ n ] = \left \{ \begin{array}{cl} 0 &amp; {\rm when} \; n &lt; 0 \\ b _ n &amp; {\rm when} \; 0 \leq n \leq M \\ 0 &amp; {\rm when} \; n &gt; M \; . \end{array} \right .$
