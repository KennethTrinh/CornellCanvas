  Without a previous final being posted, what is the best way to prepare for the content being tested on the final exam? Should we just be re-doing homework problems or is there another recommended way to study?

  I often found the problems in the textbook to be helpful.

  The problems on the final will be like those on the prelims, just more, like six instead of four.  You can bet there will be a DFT problem kind of like the one on Spring 2020 Prelim II.  As for $z$-transforms and systems governed by recursive difference equations, any problem will probably be similar to homework, although as you've see the prelim problems aren't quite like homework problems.

  It's good to know how things hang together, and understanding the lecture material is crucial for that.
