 What if x(t) was non periodic, but its frequency never exceeded 1/2 fsamp. If we sampled it periodically, would the final signal have to be periodic or could we get back the same non periodic signal? And if it was periodic, would that be a "periodic alias" of a non periodic signal?

  If you sample $x ( t )$ at  $f _ s &gt; 2 f _ {\rm max}$ and put the samples through an ideal D-to-C with interpolation interval $T _ s = 1 / f _ s$, then $x ( t )$ will emerge, whether $x ( t )$ is periodic or not.

   Sample x(t) = t "periodically" although it's a bit confusing what that might mean since values never repeat it has no period.
