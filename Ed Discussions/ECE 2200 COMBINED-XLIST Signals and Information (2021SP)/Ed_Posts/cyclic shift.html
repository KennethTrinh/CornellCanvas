  I found this in my lecture notes: did I copy this diagram incorrectly? I thought 0 mod 7 was 0, so the value of x[3], 4, should correspond to n=0 and not n=6 in y[n]. Should the diagram of y[n] be rotated 1 to the right?

  Say you want $y [ 3 ]$.  That's the same as $x [ 0 ]$, which is 1.

  Say you want $y [ 4 ]$.  That's the same as $x [ 3 ]$, which is 2.

  Having trouble figuring out the issue here.  :-)

  Oh, sorry I think I just got confused in the numbers. I was also a little confused on hw8 q4- why is everything 0 outside of 0 to 7? Whenever we are talking about N-pt signals, do we always consider them to be aperiodic?

  No!  The book does it that way --- "$N$-point signals are periodic" --- but I do it the following way: "an $N$-point signal is a whole signal $x [ n ]$ that satisfies $x [ n ] = 0$ for $n &lt; 0$ and for $n \geq N$.  This is probably my most major departure from how the book does DFT stuff, which I find kludgy.
