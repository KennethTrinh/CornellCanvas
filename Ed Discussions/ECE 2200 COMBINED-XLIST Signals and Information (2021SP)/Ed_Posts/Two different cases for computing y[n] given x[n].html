 We are told that if x[n] is a pure sinusoid, it does not have a frequency response and that causal FIRs always have a frequency response. Why are pure sinusoids not considered causal FIRs?

  I think you're conflating DTFTs and frequency responses.  Systems, not signals, have frequency responses.  Signals, not systems, have DTFTs.  Pure sinusoidal

  don't have DTFTs.  Causal FIR

   systems
  </i>
  always have frequency responses.

   Can I ask then why pure sinusoids don't have DTFTs, or is that something we will cover in a later course?

    Later course ---- you need Dirac $\delta$-functions to make it work.
