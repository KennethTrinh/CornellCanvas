  For part c, I applied the ak equation but I kept getting 0 and that didn't make any sense since I got an actual value other than 0 for a0

  Be careful about what happens to the limits of integration.  Note that $x ( t ) = 0$ for a sub-interval of each period.

  i think the issue i'm having is for the integral going from 0 to 4, Im gettting an e^(-1j8pif0k) which then I simplify that to 1/1 since e^(j8pi) is just 1 and 1 to the power of f0k is also one. I don't know if that really made any sense but when I complete the integral, I just get 1 - 1 = 0

  You can't do "the power $f _ o k$" maneuver you refer to unless $f _ o k$ is an integer.  It's a complex-number thing.

  Like for example,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  $j = e ^ {j \pi / 2} = e ^ {j 2 \pi ( 1 / 4 )} \neq 1 ^ {1 / 4} = 1$.

  so the rule only applies to integers and not rational numbers in general?

  To extend on profs answer, if you pay attention to the exponent it might turn out to give an integer answer that isn't 1.
