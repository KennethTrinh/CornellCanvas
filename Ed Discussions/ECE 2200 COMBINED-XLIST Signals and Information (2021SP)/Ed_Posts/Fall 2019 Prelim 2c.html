 When doing this problem, I converted x(t) to a sum of complex exponentials, and then tried to multiply it by the complex exponential form of the new cos(2*pi*17*t). I didn't get the correct spectra though, and I was wondering how to recognize how that cos(2*pi*17*t) term was going to be amplitude modulated. Is it just because it has a greater frequency than x(t)?

  Your method should work fine.  I think you must have made a mistake executing it.
