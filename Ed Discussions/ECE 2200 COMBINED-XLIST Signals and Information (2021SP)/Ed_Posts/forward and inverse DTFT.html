  Sorry if this was already answered in class:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The textbook states that two different signals cannot have the same DTFT. Does that also imply that two different DTFTs X
  <sub>
   1
  </sub>
  (w) and X
  <sub>
   2
  </sub>
  (w) cannot map to the same x[n], meaning that the forward DTFT is a one-to-one linear transformation from signal space to frequency space and vice versa for the inverse DTFT?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Following this, if a DTFT can be constructed using the analysis equation, does that imply that the original signal is able to be reconstructed using the synthesis equation (and vice versa)? Or are there pairs that only go one way, where applying the reverse transformation does not yield the expected output?

  The correspondence is one-to-one, exactly as you note in your second paragraph above.  That said, sometimes one of the analysis or synthesis equations works and the other doesn't.  For almost every example we consider in this class, both equations work.  Things are worse for the continuous-time Fourier transform, which we won't cover this semester.
