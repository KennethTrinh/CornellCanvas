 I understand the pairing the textbook gives for the delta function for the frequency domain, but when I tried to just reason it out it didn't seem to give me the correct answer. I thought that for n=2, the delta functions would sum to 3, for n=3, it would be 2, and for n=4, it would be 5. So I had these as the coefficients in front of their respective e^-j(omega)n term, but it did not give me the same answer. Did I do something wrong?

   Oh sorry!!! Question 1 part b. I understand how its supposed to be done, I just don't see why this reasoning didn't give a correct answer.

    Okay, I don't understand your question the way you phrased it.  Can you send me a screen shot of something that didn't work out for you?
