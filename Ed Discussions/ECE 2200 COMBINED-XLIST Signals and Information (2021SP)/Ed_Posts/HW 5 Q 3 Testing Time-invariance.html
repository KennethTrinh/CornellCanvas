 I'm confused on how exactly to test for time-invariance. I went about it by plugging in x[n-n0] and seeing if that equals y[n-n0]. For example, in part a y[n-n0] = x[n-n0] * cos(.2*pi*(n-n0) whereas if you plug in x[n-n0] you get x[n-n0]* cos(.2*pi*n). Since they differ, y[n] is not time-invariant. Is this what time-invariance actually means or am I going about this the wrong way?

  You are correct about time invariance and how to test for it.
