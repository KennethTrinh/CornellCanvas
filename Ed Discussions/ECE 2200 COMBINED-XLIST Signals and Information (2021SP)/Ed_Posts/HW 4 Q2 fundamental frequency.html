 I wrote the x(t) by using euler and making it a sum of cosines. For the fundamental frequency, would I use the fundamental frequency of the original equation or for the new sum of cosines I found?

  You know how to find the fundamental frequency of a sum of cosines.  Do you know how to do that with a signal written in the original form?  Remember, the original form and your sum of cosines are expressions for the same signal.
