  On the Spring 2019 Prelim, it requires students to use the divide and conquer strategy to write recursion problems. For a while now, I’ve been in the habit of not writing them with that strategy.

  Should we expect that the prelim would ever ask we write recursion calls with that strategy for this prelim?

  The question you are referring is simply one way of implementing a recursive find_max function. There are other ways of doing this (from your question, I would guess that you wanted to split the list into a one character left element and right sublist?). This falls under the branch of recursive strategies so it technically would fall "in scope" of material for this prelim. If you would like extra practice on this, a helpful exercise could be re-writing some of your other responses to questions using a divide and conquer approach. Hope that helps!
