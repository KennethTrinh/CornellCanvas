 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 I apologize if this has already been addressed, but will we receive a reference sheet for Prelim 2?
</p>
<p>
 Thanks!

  Hi, no worries about potentially repeat questions!
 </p>
 <p>
  Same deal as Prelim 1: we expect you to  know common operations, and will give you the specifications for anything we wouldn't expect you to memorize.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  I am probably forgetting something major and embarrassing, but for now I can't remember anything new since prelim 1 except the following, which you
  <i>
   should
  </i>
  know:
  <break>
  </break>
  * method calls: use the form &lt;object&gt;.&lt;method_name&gt;(args), not &lt;classname&gt;.&lt;method_name&gt;(&lt;object&gt;, &lt;args&gt;)
  <break>
  </break>
  * dictionary syntax: reference an entry, loop through the entries.
  <break>
  </break>
 </p>
 <snippet language="py" line-numbers="true" runnable="true">
  <snippet-file id="code">
   days = {"Monday": "is fair of face",
        "Tuesday": "is full of grace",
        "Wednesday": "is full of woe",
        "Thursday": "has far to go"}
days["Thursday"] = "... wait, that's prelim day, bro!"

for day in days:
    print(day + "'s child " + days[day])
  </snippet-file>
 </snippet>
