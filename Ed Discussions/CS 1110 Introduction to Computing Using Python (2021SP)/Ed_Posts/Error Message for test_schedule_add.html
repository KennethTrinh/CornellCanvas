  I get the error message above when testing the add() method for the Schedule class. My code appears to have obeyed the specification but I still run into this error when I test it.

  Hi,

 <paragraph>
  Could you try running a6_in_action and including a screenshot of the roster so I can help you figure out what's going on?

  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Looking at the new screenshot that you have uploaded, you are running into a key error.   This key error is occurring because 'CS 1110 LEC 001' is not in the dictionary associated with the schedule class courses attribute.  It seems that you are trying to access the value for CS 1110 LEC 001 instead of appending it to the courses dictionary or perhaps CS 1110 LEC 001 is not being appended to courses dictionary because of incorrect implementation of code. I will now give you an example of correctly appending things to a dictionary.

 <snippet language="py" line-numbers="true" runnable="true">
  <snippet-file id="code">
   dictionary = {'cornelius': 'is awesome'}

# we want to append key "Prof Lee" which has value 'is cool' to varibale dictionary

dictionary['Prof Lee'] = 'is cool' # dictionary will now become ['cornelius': 'is awesome', 'Prof Lee': 'is cool']

print(dictionary) # prints newly appended dictionary

print('I hope this helps :D')

  You can replace 'is cool' with 'is very appreciative of all you do to help your fellow students'!

  I used the same logic as you have illustrated. I will go through it again later. Thanks very much.
