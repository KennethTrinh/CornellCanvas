  When implementing the helper function less_than(c1, c2) in cardstuff.py, why do we not need to import the module card_labv1.py ? (How is Python able to access the attributes "rank" and "suit" of Card if the class Card and its attributes have not been defined?)

  When you actually use the function less_than(c1, c2) (such as in the test file), you have to import the module to create the cards and use them for the parameters of less_than. Python is basically able to backtrack when you use c1.rank in less_than back to the test file, to the module import.
