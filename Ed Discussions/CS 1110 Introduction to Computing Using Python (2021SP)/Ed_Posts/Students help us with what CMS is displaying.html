  Hi, for students who aren't in the Ithaca time zone:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Can you please put in the comments:
 </paragraph>
 <list style="number">
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    what CMS is showing you for the deadline for A1? (I see March 5, 2021 11:59PM)
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    what CMS is showing you for the time you see for the first timeslot in the 1:1 schedule,
    <link href="https://cmsx.cs.cornell.edu/web/auth/?action=schedule&amp;assignid=8016"/>
    https://cmsx.cs.cornell.edu/web/auth/?action=schedule&amp;assignid=8016 ?  I see "February 26, 2021 11:00AM - 11:30 AM".
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    what your time zone is?
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
 </list>

  I've just heard that CMS may be displaying times in (some guess it is making about?) the viewer's time zone, whereas I have been expecting it is showing times in the Ithaca time zone.

   (The due date for the first part of A1 is Friday March 5, 11:59pm Ithaca time. I am worried that CMS might not be making this clear.)
