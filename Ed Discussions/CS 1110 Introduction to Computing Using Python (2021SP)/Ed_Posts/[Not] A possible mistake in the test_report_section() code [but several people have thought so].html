 In line 160 of my a1_first.py code, the expected value of the function includes "1865 on the Dot", which comes from the 'data-section="1865 on the Dot"' substring. Is the D in Dot supposed to be capitalized? The doctring for report_section states that only the first letter should be capitalized, and in this case, the 1 in 1865 would be the first character. So why is the D in Dot capitalized in the expected return value?

  Hi! It's great you're looking very carefully at the capitalization!

  The specification says (pg 8. lines 5-6 in the spec for report_section): "
  <i>
   The section number should be 6 exactly as in s with respect to capitalization, spacing, and so on",
  </i>
  where "section number" refers to the thing after data-section=" and before the next double-quote.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, the test case is correct.

   Given that the test case is correct then, how should be go about addressing this given the function of capitalize() is limited in this way?

    Hi, think carefully about what the specification is saying for the section number: "
    <i>
     The section number should be exactly as in s with respect to capitalization, spacing, and so on
    </i>
    ".  (The answer will come to you!)
