 I am currently working to show which line is being executed in my functions ... I am wondering if we put are code into atom or python tutor if the lines they give us with comments  included are the ones that would be corresponding correctly to those in the object.py file ? Sorry if this is too specific as a question, I tried to keep it relatively ambiguous

  Hi, your question is clear, no worries!

  When in doubt, use the line numbers given in section 9 on the handout, as stated in section 7 on the handout:
  <break>

 <blockquote>
  <break>
  </break>
  In your diagrams,
  <b>
   use the line numbers given in Section 9
  </b>
  , and
  <b>
   choose consecutive ids for the objects you create
  </b>
  . This is different than what Python Tutor does! (More on this below.)
