 (obviously, hoping this isn't the case)

<p>
 Will the exam be administered online for all students? (or has the university given any guidance on what the consequences of going to orange are?)
</p>
<p>
 If so, would it be potentially delayed to accommodate the transition (ie; would Ithaca students need to do the 20-minute practice exam, etc...)?

  If we need to make the exam online for all students, we will do so, and we would (necessarily) have to have make time for training sessions for all students.
