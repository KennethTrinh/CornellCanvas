  In the "code cleanup" instructions, it says to make sure that I have indented with spaces instead of tabs. What is the difference between 4 spaces vs. using one tab?

  If you are using Atom editor and have formatted the settings correctly initially (tab length 4, auto/soft tab type), this should not be an issue as pressing tab will automatically include 4 spaces. A hard tab is the tab character, which is different from a space character, and your indentation should be using spaces not tab characters.
