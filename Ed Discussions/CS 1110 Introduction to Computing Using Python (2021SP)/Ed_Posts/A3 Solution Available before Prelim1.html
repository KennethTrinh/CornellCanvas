 Would the solution to A3 be available before prelim 1?
</p>
<p>
 I do not think I completed it correctly, and would like to know the correct way to solve A3 before prelim 1.

   From the A3 handout, pg 3 (as part of section 4 "Timelines and Deadlines"): "(g) We will release solutions by Monday the 29th, since prelim 1 is on Tuesday the 30th."
