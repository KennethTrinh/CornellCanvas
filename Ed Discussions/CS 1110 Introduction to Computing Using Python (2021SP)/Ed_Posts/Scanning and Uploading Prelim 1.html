  If we will be using a phone to record ourselves during a Zoom proctor session, how would we go about using a phone application to scan and upload our answer sheets? Wouldn't this require leaving Zoom?

  Yes, when you start scanning from your phone you do leave the Zoom proctor session. But we will be keeping track of when you leave and when you upload your answer sheets in Gradescope. Once you upload, you will have to rejoin the meeting to let the proctor know that you uploaded, and then we check your submission to give you the OK.
