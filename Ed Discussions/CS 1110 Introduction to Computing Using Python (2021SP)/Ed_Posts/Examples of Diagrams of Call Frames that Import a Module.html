  I've noticed that we have many examples of diagrams of code under archived assignments, but none of these seem to involve importing a module (like A2_objects.py does). Do you know if there are any worked problems we can refer to when trying to figure out how the importing factors into our diagrams?

  I'm very glad you are looking at the previous assignments!  The 2020 spring assignment does do an import (of a module

  </code>
  ).

  And, the 2021 assignment, under section 6 "Notational Conventions", item 7, says
