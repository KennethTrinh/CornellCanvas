 When I saved my completed a1_first a copy would be made and embedded in a folder 'skeleton' embedded in a new folder called 'Assignment 1.'
</p>
<p>
 Every time I saved my assignment 1_first py file this would happen and when the time came to submit I had a multiple copy files and it took me a good 30 minutes to sort through everything. Is this happening to anyone else or am I doing something wrong?

  Yikes!  This sounds really frustrating.

  I'm not entirely sure what's happening yet.  Let's get some more info!
 </p>
 <list style="number">
  <li>
   <p>
    Are you on Windows, MacOS, or something else?
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Are you using Atom, or something else, to edit files?
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Are you using "Save" (or command-S on macos), or "Save as..." (shift-command-S on macos) to save files?
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    What is the name of the directory (folder) the original "Assignment 1" folder is in?  And what director (folder) is that in?  And so on?
    <break>
    </break>
    For instance, maybe you have
    <code>
     home directory/CS 1110/Assignment 1
    </code>
    .
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    What happens if you download the assignment files from the course webpage into a
    <b>
     different
    </b>
    directory (folder), such as directly into your home directory?  Does saving files act normally there?
    <break>

  </li>
 </list>

  What seems to be happening is that you do not have "permission" to save into the original Assignment 1 folder, and so Atom (are you using Atom?) is forced to save into a new place.  But I cannot currently reproduce the behavior: I get a message saying that permission is denied, instead.
  <break>
  </break>

  Atom does have reported strange locations for save as, but that's not relevant to the problem OP is seeing.
