  When I saved my completed a1_first a copy would be made and embedded in a folder 'skeleton' embedded in a new folder called 'Assignment 1.'
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Every time I saved my assignment 1_first py file this would happen and when the time came to submit I had a multiple copy files and it took me a good 30 minutes to sort through everything. Is this happening to anyone else or am I doing something wrong?

  Yikes!  This sounds really frustrating.

  I'm not entirely sure what's happening yet.  Let's get some more info!

    Are you using Atom, or something else, to edit files?

    Are you using "Save" (or command-S on macos), or "Save as..." (shift-command-S on macos) to save files?

    What is the name of the directory (folder) the original "Assignment 1" folder is in?  And what director (folder) is that in?  And so on?
    <break>
    </break>
    For instance, maybe you have
    <code>
     home directory/CS 1110/Assignment 1
    </code>
    .

    What happens if you download the assignment files from the course webpage into a
    <bold>
     different
    </bold>
    directory (folder), such as directly into your home directory?  Does saving files act normally there?

  What seems to be happening is that you do not have "permission" to save into the original Assignment 1 folder, and so Atom (are you using Atom?) is forced to save into a new place.  But I cannot currently reproduce the behavior: I get a message saying that permission is denied, instead.

  Atom does have reported strange locations for save as, but that's not relevant to the problem OP is seeing.
