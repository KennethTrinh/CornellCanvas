  Hello,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Can we make changes to the __init__ method of the Course class and give it another attribute?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thanks!

  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The following comments in the Course class are as follows:
 </paragraph>
 <snippet language="py" line-numbers="true" runnable="false">
  <snippet-file id="code">
   # STUDENTS: below this comment block (but within the docstring for class
        # Course), document any attributes you add.  
        # Don't delete this comment block, so the graders can easily see what you 
        # added.
        #
        # You'll want attribute(s) or method(s) that 
        # (1) represent the meeting time of the course,
        # (2) make it easy to retrieve the Course's times in "standard" format
        # (3) make it easy to compute whether another Course conflicts.
        # COURSE_DOCSTRING_BLOCK
  </snippet-file>
 </snippet>
 <paragraph>
  This means that you are allowed to make more attributes for the course Class. To make these attributes a reality, you will need to update the init method of the course Class.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  So, for instance, you want to add the attribute "cool_person_rating" to the course Class. After implementing this attribute, the code would look like the following.  Note that the description of the attribute has been added to the specification of the course Class to explain what it is.
 </paragraph>
 <snippet language="py" line-numbers="true" runnable="false">
  <snippet-file id="code">
   class Course:
    """ An instance represents a class.

    Instance attributes:
        name [non-empty string]: name of the course
        in_schedules: list of Schedules this Course is in

        # STUDENTS: below this comment block (but within the docstring for class
        # Course), document any attributes you add.  
        # Don't delete this comment block, so the graders can easily see what you

        # COURSE_DOCSTRING_BLOCK

        cool_person_rating = rates how cool a person is


        
    """
    def __init__(self, n, t):
        """

        meeting time t, and in_schedules set to the empty list

                (Examples: "CS 1110 LEC 001", "CS 1110 DIS 201")
            t: string of the form (no beginning or trailing spaces)

               Examples of valid values for t:

                "R 8:07am-11:00am"

        self.name = n
        self.in_schedules = []

        # STUDENTS: implement the rest of this method below; leave the lines
        # above alone.
        # Do not delete this comment block, to help the graders find your code.
        # COURSE INIT BLOCK

        self.cool_person_rating = t

 <paragraph>
  As a note, I do not think you can change the parameters of the init method.

  -Hope this helps! :)))

  Correct, and you shouldn't change the parameters for any provided methods
