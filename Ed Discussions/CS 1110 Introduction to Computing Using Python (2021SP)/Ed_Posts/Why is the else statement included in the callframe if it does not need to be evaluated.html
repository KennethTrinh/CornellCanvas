 I was wondering for Assignment 2, in the last call frame, why line 31,  "else:" needs to be included if the else statement isn't really something to be evaluated (it doesn't have an expression like an if or elif statment).
</p>
<p>
 On python tutor, I tried making an if statement where the expression is false and python tutor showed me that the next line to the run skips the else statement. However, I do know that python tutor evaluates things in a different manner than lecture, and I was also wondering if this was one of the differences, where the line for the else statement needs to be run?

  On the assignment 2 handout, section 6, point 10 states "else-statements should be treated as executable (and executed) lines." So yes, this was indeed one of those differences
