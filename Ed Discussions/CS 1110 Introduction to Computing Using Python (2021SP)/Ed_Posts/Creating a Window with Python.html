  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Is there anyway to make python display a window with text in it?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I’ve been working on a text adventure, but it would only work in power shell, is there a way to make python create a new window when you execute the file to play the text adventure?

  You might want a

  GUI? You would run the .py file in powershell, and then a graphical window would pop up, which could interactively display text, images, buttons, etc. Is that what you're asking for? There are a few packages, such as
  <link href="https://kivy.org/doc/stable/guide/basic.html"/>
  Kivy, that can do this.

  You might also be able to just open another window (like command prompt maybe?) using
  <break>
  </break>
  os.system(&lt;code to open a file in CMD.exe&gt;),
  <break>
  </break>
  although I'm not really sure how well `os.system` works. (Also it wouldn't be cross-platform compatible.)
