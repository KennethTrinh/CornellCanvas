 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 Is there anyway to make python display a window with text in it?
</p>
<p>
 I’ve been working on a text adventure, but it would only work in power shell, is there a way to make python create a new window when you execute the file to play the text adventure?
</p>

  You might want a

   GUI
   ? You would run the .py file in powershell, and then a graphical window would pop up, which could interactively display text, images, buttons, etc. Is that what you're asking for? There are a few packages, such as

   Kivy
  </a>
  , that can do this.

    You might also be able to just open another window (like command prompt maybe?) using
    <break>
    </break>
    os.system(&lt;code to open a file in CMD.exe&gt;),
    <break>
    </break>
    although I'm not really sure how well `os.system` works. (Also it wouldn't be cross-platform compatible.)
