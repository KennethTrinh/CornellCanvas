 When adding a test case to the a1_first.py file, should we identify it with a comment, like we do when we are deleting or fixing a test case? For example, we could put # STUDENT ADDED CASE so you could identify which ones I added in versus what was already in the template?

  No need to add such a comment (or any in this sense) but it’s definitely highly encouraged to add a comment explaining the test! (can be 1-2 sentences).

  Will make your grader’s life nice and is definitely a good coding practice.

   (And it is required to have the explanatory comment; Section 5, item 3, last sentence, on page 9: "For each test case you add, include in a comment a short justification of what the test case represents. ")

    Can the explanation be the same length as the explanations/comments for the given test cases or is it expected that we write more?

     It is definitely fine to model the length of your documentation comments after those we gave.
