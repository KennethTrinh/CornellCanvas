  Hi, I've tried running query roster a few times as I've been developing my functions just to see what I would get, but I keep getting the same import error that tells me that requests.py doesn't exit.

  Can you also paste in your Python banner?  I'm wondering if you are running Anaconda python or a different python.

  hm, try running
  <code>
   python -m pip install requests
  </code>
  in terminal?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  (
  <code>
   requests
  </code>
  is a common python package; you can use
  <code>
   pip
  </code>
  like this to download &amp; install some of the common python packages)

  this should work, but i feel like the problem might have been that OP didn't install Anaconda.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  OP, did you install python independently (
  <link href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs1110/2021sp/materials/install-python-landing.html"/>
  without looking at the instructions in the course website) or already had it installed? If so, you should try uninstalling python and re-installing it through the instructions in the course website so you will have Anaconda, which has some important libraries used throughout the course.

  (In offline conversation, indeed, the OP is not running python 3. I am consulting with them now about options, since they did receive advice about not making Anaconda Python 3 their default.)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Students: the main issue was not using Anaconda Python 3.
