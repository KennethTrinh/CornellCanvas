 Hi, I've tried running query roster a few times as I've been developing my functions just to see what I would get, but I keep getting the same import error that tells me that requests.py doesn't exit.

<p>
 Full Traceback:

  Can you also paste in your Python banner?  I'm wondering if you are running Anaconda python or a different python.

  (In offline conversation, indeed, the OP is not running python 3. I am consulting with them now about options, since they did receive advice about not making Anaconda Python 3 their default.)
 </p>
 <p>
  Students: the main issue was not using Anaconda Python 3.

   hm, try running
   <code>
    python -m pip install requests
   </code>
   in terminal?
  </p>
  <p>
   (
   <code>
    requests
   </code>
   is a common python package; you can use
   <code>
    pip
   </code>
   like this to download &amp; install some of the common python packages)
  </p>

    this should work, but i feel like the problem might have been that OP didn't install Anaconda.
   </p>
   <p>
    OP, did you install python independently (
    <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs1110/2021sp/materials/install-python-landing.html">
     without looking at the instructions in the course website)
    </a>
    or already had it installed? If so, you should try uninstalling python and re-installing it through the instructions in the course website so you will have Anaconda, which has some important libraries used throughout the course.
   </p>
