  I am trying to do my labs but it won't let me into the lab server. It says:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  "Access Denied (403) The website cs1110.cs.cornell.edu is unable to accept your credentials. You may not have sufficient privileges to access this page. If you continue to have problems please contact the website administrator."
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I restarted my computer 2 times and deleted cookies on Chrome but it still does not work. What should I do? All other pages that require NetID login are working fine.

  So that you can do some work on paper until the lab server issue is resolved:
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  Here's what the first activity for lab 7 looks like:
  <break>
  </break>
 </paragraph>
 <blockquote>
  <break>
  </break>
  Here is the specification for a function that could be useful for fixing typos:
 </blockquote>
 <blockquote>
 </blockquote>
 <blockquote>
 </blockquote>
 <blockquote>
  <bold>
   def
  </bold>
  replace_first(word, target, rep):
  <break>
  </break>
  """Returns: a copy of string word with the FIRST instance of string
  <break>
  </break>
  target in word replaced by string rep.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  Example: replace_first('THanks', 'H', 'h') -&gt; 'Thanks'
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  Preconditions: target has length &gt;=1 and appears in word.
  <break>
  </break>
  As mentioned, all the arguments have type str.
  <break>
  </break>
  """
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  Design a suite of test cases
 </blockquote>
 <blockquote>
  The first step to implementing a function so that it meets its specification (a.k.a. "spec") is to design test cases for that function. That is, you want a set of inputs to that function that covers all the possible kinds of legal inputs, together with the resultant outputs according to the spec.   This sort of activity can require creativity as you imagine all the kinds of situations that can crop up! And in the real world, there's nothing that tells you "how many" test cases are needed.Having these test cases in hand will make testing and debugging the function, once you start implementing it, much smoother!
 </blockquote>
 <blockquote>
  Fill in the table below with
  <bold>
   non-redundant
  </bold>
  test cases for
  <code>
   replace_first
  </code>
  . You may use the one given in the spec as one of your test cases.
 </blockquote>
 <blockquote>
  Due to some limitations of the underlying verifier, such that it can't always tell that two test cases are conceptually different, you may also, for this lab, need to make your test cases
  <bold>
   non-overlapping
  </bold>
  , meaning that each test case should not share
  <italic>
   any
  </italic>
  features in common with the others.
 </blockquote>
 <blockquote>
  We strongly suggest you
  <bold>
   first write in just one test case and hit submit
  </bold>
  , to make sure you understand what format is expected by the system. (Don't fill in all the boxes at once just to have all that work go to waste from a formatting issue!)
