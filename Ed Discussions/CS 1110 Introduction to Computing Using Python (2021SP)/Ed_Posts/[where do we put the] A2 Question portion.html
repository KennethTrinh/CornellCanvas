  For the questions about what each person's (Martha, Ryan, etc) favorite book is throughout the code, is there an answer sheet as the assignment indicates there is or can we answer in a word doc and submit as a pdf ? Additionally, for this section, should we be providing an explanation or rational for why the variables change or not ?

  Hi!

  Just put your answers on the same sheets of paper as your diagrams (since you'll probably be drawing the diagrams and answering those questions simultaneously.)

  No need for written explanation; the/a beauty of the diagrams is that they serve as sufficient explanation themselves!

  So you might have one page be your first diagram, and if there's room, but the answers to the questions underneath your diagram; or if there isn't room, put your answers to the questions on a separate page.  Then do the next diagram either at the bottom of the second page, after the answers, or on its own page.
