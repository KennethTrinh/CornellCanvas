  Wrap the expression you’re trying to convert to an int with int().
  <break>
  </break>
  e.g. int(“53”)
  <break>
  </break>
  or
  <break>
  </break>
  x = “53”
  <break>
  </break>
  x = int(x)

  Thank you for your help. I am having an additional problem with the string slicing.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I'm either string slicing only the first position and receiving and error, or string slicing the first two positions and receiving an error for including a colon in the first input of 9:04
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  ... On input '9:04', your code returned correct value 9
  <break>
  </break>
  ... On input '22:13', your code returned incorrect value 2, not correct value 22.
  <break>
  </break>
  ... On input '22:09', your code returned incorrect value 2, not correct value 22.
  <break>
  </break>
  ... On input '22:00', your code returned incorrect value 2, not correct value 22.
  <break>
  </break>
  ... On input '10:55', your code returned incorrect value 1, not correct value 10.
  <break>
  </break>
  ... On input '0:00', your code returned correct value 0
 </paragraph>

  If I attempt to string slice the first two positions instead of only the first position I receive the following error:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Did you accidentally include the colon when string slicing? Or could your string slice accidentally be empty?
  <break>
  </break>
  Here is what Python reported as the problem: invalid literal for int() with base 10: ':'

  That is because the colon will be at different indexes depending on whether the hour is one digit long or two digits long.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  You should look into using the string "index" function, to which you basically give a string and subsection of that string, and it gives you the index of where in the string that subsection is.
