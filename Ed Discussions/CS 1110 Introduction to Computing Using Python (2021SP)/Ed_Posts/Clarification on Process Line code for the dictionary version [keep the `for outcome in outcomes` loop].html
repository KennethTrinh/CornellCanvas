 Do we implement our code under the "BELOW THIS LINE" comment in the for loop provided? Or are we not supposed to utilize the provided for loop?
</p>
<p>
 Thanks in advance!

  That's correct, the "BELOW THE LINE" is so that you leave the "for outcome in outcomes" line in there (and you utilize that for-loop).
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  One needs handle every outcome, so for-loops are (in my opinion) the better choice than a while-loop, where you have to do extra book-keeping.

   Okay, thank you! I was confused as the comments were not at the same indent level as the body of the for loop.

    Yeah, I actually vacillated about what indent level I should put the comments in.

    However, you are allowed to write some code that is outside the
    <code>
     for outcome in outcomes
    </code>
    for-loop.

     This remark ties in with the optional challenge, section 6.2.2 of the handout.
