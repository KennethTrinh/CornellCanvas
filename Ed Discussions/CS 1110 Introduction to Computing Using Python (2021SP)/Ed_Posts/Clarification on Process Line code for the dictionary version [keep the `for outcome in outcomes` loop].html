  Do we implement our code under the "BELOW THIS LINE" comment in the for loop provided? Or are we not supposed to utilize the provided for loop?

  Thanks in advance!

  That's correct, the "BELOW THE LINE" is so that you leave the "for outcome in outcomes" line in there (and you utilize that for-loop).
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  One needs handle every outcome, so for-loops are (in my opinion) the better choice than a while-loop, where you have to do extra book-keeping.

  However, you are allowed to write some code that is outside the
  <code>
   for outcome in outcomes
  </code>
  for-loop.

  This remark ties in with the optional challenge, section 6.2.2 of the handout.

  Okay, thank you! I was confused as the comments were not at the same indent level as the body of the for loop.

  Yeah, I actually vacillated about what indent level I should put the comments in.
