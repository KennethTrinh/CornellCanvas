  Are we allowed to use methods within the class Course in the implementation of other methods? My partner and I are trying to use conflictsWith in our implementation for changeTime but are being met with an error that conflictsWith is not defined, which seems odd.

  You are certainly allowed to write calls to Course methods outside of the Course class. Make sure you're calling conflictsWith as a method - if
  <code>
   a
  </code>
  and
  <code>
   b
  </code>
  are Course instances, the syntax is
  <code>
   a.conflictsWith(b)
  </code>
