   I know that a few days ago, someone asked whether we will be provided a list of common methods (e.g. strip(), join(), pop(), etc...) for the exam, like test takers in 2017, 2018, and 2020 were. Will this be the case again, or should we memorize important methods this year?

    Safest to be memorizing important methods for now.  We will be able to finalize our answer about the function/methods reference sheet when we've finalized the exam contents.
