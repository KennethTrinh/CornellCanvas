 Hi all, for a larger (but prelim-sized!) worked example of classes interacting, look at problem 5 of Spring 2014 Prelim2:
 <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs1110/2021sp/exams/prelim2/2014-spring-prelim2.pdf">
  exam itself
  ,

 Yes, that example also involved courses, schedules, and students, but they are
 <i>
  different
 </i>
 classes than what you are working with in A6.
 <break>
 </break>
 <break>
 </break>
 For example, 2014-Courses have an attribute
 <code>
  students
 </code>
 which is the list of students enrolled in that course.
 <break>
 </break>
 <break>
 </break>
 For a 2014-student, a semester Schedule on that 2014 prelim had an attribute
 <code>
  courses
 </code>
 tracking which Courses a Student is taking.
 <break>
 </break>
 <break>
 </break>
 So method
 <code>
  add_course
 </code>
 for a 2014-Student looks like this:
</p>
<pre>class Student:

    """attribute schedules: list of schedules from all semester, in reverse 
    chronological order, with the schedule for the current semester being at 
    position 0 in that list."""

    def add_course(self, course):
    
        # Add this Student to the list of students in object `course`
        course.students.append(self) 
        
        # This student's current semester is self.schedules[0]
        # That semester 
        self.schedules[0].courses.apppend(course)
        
        
        </pre>
