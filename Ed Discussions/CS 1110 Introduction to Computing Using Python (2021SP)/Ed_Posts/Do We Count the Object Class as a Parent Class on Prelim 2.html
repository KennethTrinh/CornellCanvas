 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 On the study guide, it says we should be prepared to diagram class folders with their parent class in parentheses.
</p>
<p>
 But we haven't covered subclasses/inheritance yet, so what parent class could the guide be referring to? Would the object class count, like "Person(object)" as a name on the class folder?
</p>
<p>
 Or, are we expected to know about how to diagram parent/subclasses (just not how to use them)?
</p>
<p>
 Thanks!
</p>

  Oh, shoot, I should have elided the "parent class in parentheses" part, since we haven't yet done sub/super classes.  So, don't worry about parent classes in drawing class folders.
