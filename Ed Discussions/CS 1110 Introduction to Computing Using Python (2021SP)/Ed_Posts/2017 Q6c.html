  Put in your question title the year, semester, and question.  Ideal would also be to include the topic.   Example: 2018SP Q2(b) - call frames
 </callout>
 <callout type="info">
  Include a screenshot of the question, so readers/answerers don't have to go find the relevant pdf.

  If found = 'a', then why is the value for v 'u'? Is this because the conditional doesn't continue, but for continues to loop?

  Exactly! Even if you don’t execute the if statement inside of the for loop, the loop will still continue as long as there are no errors (and there aren’t) until it’s gone through every element in [a, e, i, o, u] as v, and since the last element is u, v’s last value will be u
