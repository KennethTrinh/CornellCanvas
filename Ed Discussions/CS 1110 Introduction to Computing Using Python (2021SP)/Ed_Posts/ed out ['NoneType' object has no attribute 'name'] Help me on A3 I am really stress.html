  It says "'NoneType' object has no attribute 'name'". If you look at line 122 of helper_tests, and the lines just above it, you can see which test case is failing. In this case, the test is calling
  <code>
   college_named
  </code>
  and assigning that to
  <code>
   result
  </code>
  . Python then checks
  <code>
   result.name
  </code>
  , which throws that error, so
  <code>
   result
  </code>
  must be of type NoneType. This means that your function
  <code>
   college_named
  </code>
  is returning
  <code>
   None
  </code>
  instead of a college (even when the college exists), at least some of the time.

  Make sure your function is always returning a college (if the college exists); if double-checking your logic doesn't help, then maybe try using debugging print statements to make sure that your variables all have the values you'd expect, or to check which lines are being run.

  I am getting the same error message and have been trying to debug with print statements. The problem I have found by doing that, seems to be that I can't figure out how to reach into each of the College objects and pull out their names to compare to 'n', since College objects are not iterable. Any suggestions to go from this point?
