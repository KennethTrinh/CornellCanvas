 <paragraph>
  (1) On Ed Discussions, do not post any portions of your assignment code or lab answers, and do not ask for direct answers to lab exercise questions.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  <italic>
   Rationale
  </italic>
  : We want you to get help on your questions!  But we want all students to get the educational value of working through lab exercises/assignments without the possibility of having previously seen the answers.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  So, either make a good-faith effort to rephrase your post so as to not be essentially asking directly for an answer to a question we posed to you as classwork, or ask your question at
  <link href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs1110/2021sp/staff/"/>
  office/consulting hours (or, for lab exercises, ask a classmate or staff member during section).
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  <italic>
   Alternately,
  </italic>
  you
  <italic>
   can
  </italic>
  post to Ed Discussions any
  <italic>
   error messages
  </italic>
  you get from running your code, instead of the code itself. (And in fact, that's often enough debugging info for someone to help you out.)
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  See
  <link href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs1110/2021sp/policies/cs1110integrity.html"/>
  the course collaboration polices for more information.

  (2) A nice usage guide for Ed Discussions by Omar Khan:
  <break>
  </break>
  "An Ed guide for Piazza users":
  <link href="https://sp21.datastructur.es/materials/guides/ed-guide"/>
  https://sp21.datastructur.es/materials/guides/ed-guide
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Includes an explanation of the difference between a checkmark (only one answer can get it, and instructor answers get it by default, but students can assign it to other students), and endorsement (can only be applied by course staff), and a heart (a "like", and "likes" can accumulate).

  Addendum to (1):  you
  <italic>
   can
  </italic>
  post any error messages you get from running your code, instead of the code itself.  (And in fact, that's often enough debugging info for someone to help you out.)
