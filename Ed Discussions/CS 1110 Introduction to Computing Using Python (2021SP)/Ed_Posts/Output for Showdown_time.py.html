  The indices of the colleges when
  <bold>
   showdown_time.py
  </bold>
  is run on
  <bold>
   sd__utilities_dict
  </bold>
  differs from the indices of the colleges when it is run on
  <bold>
   sd_utilities_list
  </bold>
  ,  but the data for a pair of colleges is same: selecting Cornell_U vs Harvard_U gives the same 10.0% and 90.0%. This, I think is from the sort function we applied to the list.

 <paragraph>
  However, the last index of the items in
  <bold>
   a2c_census2020_processed.txt
  </bold>
  when
  <bold>
   showdown_time.py
  </bold>
  is run on
  <bold>
   sd_utilities_dict
  </bold>
  is
  <bold>
   231
  </bold>
  whereas it is
  <bold>
   234
  </bold>
  when
  <bold>
   showdown_time_py
  </bold>
  is run on
  <bold>
   sd_utilities_list
  </bold>
  .

 <paragraph>
  What could have led to this shortening?

  It shouldn't change the number of college items when changing from a list to a dictionary implementation. I suspect some colleges are not being added properly to the dictionary in your process_line function. I would check the 234-231=3 colleges that the dictionary implementation is not picking up and see how your current process_line function handles them.
