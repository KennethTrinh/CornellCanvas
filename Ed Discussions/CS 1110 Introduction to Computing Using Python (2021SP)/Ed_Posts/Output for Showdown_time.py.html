 The indices of the colleges when
 <b>
  showdown_time.py
 </b>
 is run on
 <b>
  sd__utilities_dict
 </b>
 differs from the indices of the colleges when it is run on
 <b>
  sd_utilities_list
 </b>
 ,  but the data for a pair of colleges is same: selecting Cornell_U vs Harvard_U gives the same 10.0% and 90.0%. This, I think is from the sort function we applied to the list.
</p>
<p>
 However, the last index of the items in
 <b>
  a2c_census2020_processed.txt
 </b>
 when
 <b>
  showdown_time.py
 </b>
 is run on
 <b>
  sd_utilities_dict
 </b>
 is
 <b>
  231
 </b>
 whereas it is
 <b>
  234
 </b>
 when
 <b>
  showdown_time_py
 </b>
 is run on
 <b>
  sd_utilities_list
 </b>
 .
</p>
<p>
 What could have led to this shortening?

  It shouldn't change the number of college items when changing from a list to a dictionary implementation. I suspect some colleges are not being added properly to the dictionary in your process_line function. I would check the 234-231=3 colleges that the dictionary implementation is not picking up and see how your current process_line function handles them.
