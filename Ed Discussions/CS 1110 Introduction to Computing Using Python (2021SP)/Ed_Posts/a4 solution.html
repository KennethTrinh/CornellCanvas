  As stated in the prelim 2 study guide, "Tentative release date for A4 solutions: Mon Apr 19"

  We're having a few hiccups with some student submissions (submitted the wrong files, maybe didn't submit but maybe forgot to group), which we hope can be resolved in the next couple of hours?  If students are reading their email?  --- and we can't release the solutions until these are resolved.
