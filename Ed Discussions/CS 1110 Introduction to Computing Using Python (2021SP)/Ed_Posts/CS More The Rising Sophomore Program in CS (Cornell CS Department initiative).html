 The primary goal of the rising sophomore program is to increase computer science (CS) preparation and exposure to research for participants,

 and/or first generation college students, supporting the computer science department’s commitment to access, equity, and inclusion and to enhance the diversity of Cornell's undergraduate student population. Priority will be given to students who are class of 2025 and taking (or have taken) CS 2110 and have not taken CS 2800. [There is precedent for students in CS1110 last spring being accepted for the summer 2020 program.]

 Topics include Tech Bootcamp, Discrete Structures, Computer System Organization, Functional Programming, Data Structures: all in preparation for Cornell’s sophomore-level courses in computer science (2800, 3410, 3110)
