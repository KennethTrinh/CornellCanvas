  Hi there! I thought I would practice one of the examples from the lecture. I created a .py file containing the definition of the function get_feet (from the lecture) and a command calling that function. I would have thought that when I imported this as a module python would return 'feet'. [Reasoning: python would skip the definition and go to the command. The command references the definition which returns 'feet'.] What actually happens is...nothing.

   I'm just wondering why? If I want the outcome of importing this module to be 'return feet' where did I go wrong?

  When you do get_feet at the bottom of your file, you’re basically just calling the function, getting the result (5), and the result just disappears because you’re not saving it into a variable nor printing it. If you want it to show up in the terminal, you have to wrap around the call to the method with print().
