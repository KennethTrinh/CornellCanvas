 Put in your question title the year, semester, and question.  Ideal would also be to include the topic.   Example: 2018SP Q2(b) - call frames

 Include a screenshot of the question, so readers/answerers don't have to go find the relevant pdf.

<p>
 The study guide says skip q6 since loop invariants were not covered. Does this mean we can also skip A7? (screenshot attached below)
