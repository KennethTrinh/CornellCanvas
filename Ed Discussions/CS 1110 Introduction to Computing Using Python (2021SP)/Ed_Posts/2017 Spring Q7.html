  Put in your question title the year, semester, and question.  Ideal would also be to include the topic.   Example: 2018SP Q2(b) - call frames
 </callout>
 <callout type="info">
  Include a screenshot of the question, so readers/answerers don't have to go find the relevant pdf.
 </callout>
 <paragraph>
  The study guide says skip q6 since loop invariants were not covered. Does this mean we can also skip A7? (screenshot attached below)

  Ah, sort of.  You could rewrite the question to be appropriate to our semester by saying that your while-loop would not need to satisfy the given invariant.
