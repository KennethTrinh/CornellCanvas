 Are we grading on having the correct order of id#s, for ex I am going through and doing all the global variables first then going back for functions etc... So is the order of the id# important or do they just have to match the correct variables?

  Boldfaced in Section 7:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  In your diagrams,
  <b>
   use the line numbers given
  </b>
  in Section 9, and c
  <b>
   hoose consecutive ids for the objects you create
  </b>
  . This is different than what Python Tutor does! (More on this below.)
 </blockquote>

  I'm sorry we have to insist on this,  but we have nearly 450 students' assignments to grade, so we need to eliminate speed bumps like having to trace which id number goes with which object on each submission, or we won't be able to get the grading done in a reasonable amount of time.

   But more importantly from an understanding-python point of view (as opposed to the grading policy):
   <break>
   </break>
   <break>
   </break>
   Python does not create all the global variables first, so you shouldn't do that either, tempting as that may be.
   <break>
   </break>
   <break>
   </break>
   1. It's quite important to understand the flow of execution and creation of objects.
   <break>
   </break>
   <break>
   </break>
   2. If some function call crashes, the "downstream" global variables wouldn't be created, but your diagram would have these "ghost variables" which can be read to imply that they had been created.
