 When adding a test case I understand that we should indicate what we're testing for, but should this be done in a docstring or in a comment following a hash sign? For example, one of the cases given to us already says it's testing for
 <i>
  # parts of tag show up before actual tag
 </i>
 . Should we just follow this format, or should we additionally leave a docstring further explaining our test?

  Follow that format! No need for a docstring. Also look at #33
