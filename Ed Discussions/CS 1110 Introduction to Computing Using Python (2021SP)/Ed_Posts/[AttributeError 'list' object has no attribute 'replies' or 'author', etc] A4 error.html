 When I run my code, I get the following error:
</p>
<p>
 AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'replies'
</p>
<p>
 This error occurred when I used post.replies, which I thought was supposed to be a list.  Why is this error occurring?
</p>

  I'm not sure which function you're referring to, but I think each specification mentions that
  <code>
   post
  </code>
  is a Post object (not a list).

   I am referring to the first function.  I know post is a Post object, but shouldn't post.replies be a list of tags that is possibly empty?

    <code>
     post.replies
    </code>
    is a list of Post objects, not of tags.
    <break>
    </break>
    <break>
    </break>
    But right, a list (whether of Post objects, or of tags), doesn't have an attribute
    <code>
     replies
    </code>
    , as Python is telling you.
    <break>
    </break>
    <break>
    </break>
    What kind of thing
    <i>
     does
    </i>
    have an attribute
    <code>
     replies
    </code>
    ?  a Post...
    <break>
    </break>
   </p>

     For some reason when I check to see if post.replies is an empty list, it still gives the attribute error.  I am not sure why this is happening, because post.replies is a list of Post object.

      Can you post a screenshot of the entire set of  error messages?

        OK, what must be happening is that, although
        <code>
         post
        </code>
        is
        <i>
         supposed
        </i>
        to be a
        <code>
         Post
        </code>
        object according to the preconditions, your recursive call is feeding in an input that is a list, not a
        <code>
         Post.
        </code>
        <break>
        </break>
        <break>
        </break>
        The error message actually indicates what's happening, because it shows you the call frame for
        <code>
         num_user_posts()
        </code>
        , which is currently in the middle of line 32; and then the call frame for another call of
        <code>
         num_user_posts()
        </code>
        , which crashed while executing line 24. Can you see why your line 32 is passing a list to
        <code>
         num_user_posts()
        </code>
        ?
        <break>
        </break>
        <break>
        </break>
        <break>
        </break>
        By the way:  Something I''m confused by is that this should have been caught by the assert statements at the beginning of
        <code>
         num_user_posts
        </code>
        .  Do you still have those assert statements at the beginning of the body of
        <code>
         num_user_posts()
        </code>
        ?

         I realized the assert statements were written below my code instead of above.  Now the error statement is as follows:

          Yep, just as I said above: there is a place in your code that is passing in a list rather than a Post.
