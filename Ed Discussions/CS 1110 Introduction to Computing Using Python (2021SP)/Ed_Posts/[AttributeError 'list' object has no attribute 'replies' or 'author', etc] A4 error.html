  When I run my code, I get the following error:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'replies'
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  This error occurred when I used post.replies, which I thought was supposed to be a list.  Why is this error occurring?

  I'm not sure which function you're referring to, but I think each specification mentions that
  <code>
   post
  </code>
  is a Post object (not a list).

  I am referring to the first function.  I know post is a Post object, but shouldn't post.replies be a list of tags that is possibly empty?

  <code>
   post.replies
  </code>
  is a list of Post objects, not of tags.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  But right, a list (whether of Post objects, or of tags), doesn't have an attribute
  <code>
   replies
  </code>
  , as Python is telling you.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>

  What kind of thing
  <italic>
   does
  </italic>
  have an attribute
  <code>
   replies
  </code>
  ?  a Post...

  For some reason when I check to see if post.replies is an empty list, it still gives the attribute error.  I am not sure why this is happening, because post.replies is a list of Post object.

  OK, what must be happening is that, although
  <code>
   post
  </code>
  is
  <italic>
   supposed
  </italic>
  to be a
  <code>
   Post
  </code>
  object according to the preconditions, your recursive call is feeding in an input that is a list, not a
  <code>
   Post.
  </code>
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  The error message actually indicates what's happening, because it shows you the call frame for
  <code>
   num_user_posts()
  </code>
  , which is currently in the middle of line 32; and then the call frame for another call of
  <code>
   num_user_posts()
  </code>
  , which crashed while executing line 24. Can you see why your line 32 is passing a list to
  <code>
   num_user_posts()
  </code>
  ?
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  By the way:  Something I''m confused by is that this should have been caught by the assert statements at the beginning of
  <code>
   num_user_posts
  </code>
  .  Do you still have those assert statements at the beginning of the body of
  <code>
   num_user_posts()
  </code>
  ?

  I realized the assert statements were written below my code instead of above.  Now the error statement is as follows:

  Yep, just as I said above: there is a place in your code that is passing in a list rather than a Post.
