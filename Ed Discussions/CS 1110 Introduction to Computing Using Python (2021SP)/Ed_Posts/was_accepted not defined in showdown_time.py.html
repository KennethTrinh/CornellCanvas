 When I run showdown_time.py it says was_accepted() is not defined even though I did in fact create it but in another file. Do I need to import the function from the other file or something else as they are in the same folder?

  If was_accepted() is defined in another file, you do need to import that other module. Otherwise, as you see, Python doesn't know how to find it.
