  You definitely shouldn't touch Schedule, since this assignment is meant to exercise subclass writing through affecting StudentSchedule.

  I'm having trouble envisioning why one would want to add methods to the other existing class, StudentSchedule.  Perhaps discuss with someone at office/consulting hours?

  But you are welcome to add methods to class Course.  I see I forgot to include a comment block to make it easy for the graders to see what new methods your Course method would have.  I guess we'd appreciate your adding a comment like "# NEW METHODS BLOCK" but since I forgot to put in such an instruction, you don't have to do it.
