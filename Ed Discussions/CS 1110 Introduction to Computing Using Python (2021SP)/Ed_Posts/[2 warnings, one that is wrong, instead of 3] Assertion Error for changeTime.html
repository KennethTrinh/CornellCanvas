 AssertionError: my_schedule warnings list should be ['ARCH 1120 STU 520: time changed from TBA to MWF 8:00am-8:00pm', 'ARCH 1120 STU 520: time change causes conflict with AEP 3560 LEC 001', 'ARCH 1120 STU 520: time change causes conflict with FAKER 0000 LEC 002'], but is ['ARCH 1120 STU 520: time changed from TBA to MWF 8:00am-8:00pm', 'ARCH 1120 STU 520: time change causes conflict with ARCH 1120 STU 520']
</p>

 I'm not sure why i'm getting this error because everything else in my code seems alright?

  The error message says:
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  my_schedule's warnings list
  <b>
   should
  </b>
  have
  <b>
   three
  </b>
  items in it, one about ARCH1120's time change, one about it conflicting with AEP 3160, and one about it conflicting with FAKER 0000 ...
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  ... but it only has
  <b>
   two
  </b>
  items in it: the first and second of the three messages I just listed.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  So, either FAKER 0000 isn't in my_schedule, or your code doesn't think that ARCH 1120 conflicts with FAKER 0000, or it does notice the conflict but doesn't put a message about the conflict into the
  <code>
   warnings
  </code>
  list.

   Could this an issue in my conflictsWith function? I can't seem to locate any error in my changeWith function..

    Right, one of the hypotheses mentioned above was, "your code doesn't think that ARCH 1120 conflicts with FAKER 0000 "

     I've tried debugging and printing everything but I still cannot find the issue with my code.. I keep receiving the same error :(

       So right now, I think error is probably with changeTime.
       <break>
       </break>
       <break>
       </break>
       Either it's generating the wrong warnings (indeed, it is saying that 1120 conflicts with
       <i>
        itself
       </i>
       , which shouldn't be a warning), or
       <i>
        you think it's changing the time of its
        <code>
         self
        </code>
        but it actually isn't (correctly).
       </i>
       <break>
       </break>
       <break>
       </break>
       So I would suggest checking/printing what all the time-related attributes are for arch1120 before and after line 236
       <code>
        arch1120.changeTime(new_time)
       </code>
       .
       <break>
       </break>
      </p>
