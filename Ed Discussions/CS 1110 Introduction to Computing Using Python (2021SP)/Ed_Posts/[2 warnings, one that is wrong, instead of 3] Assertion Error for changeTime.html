  The error message says:
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  my_schedule's warnings list
  <bold>
   should
  </bold>
  have
  <bold>
   three
  </bold>
  items in it, one about ARCH1120's time change, one about it conflicting with AEP 3160, and one about it conflicting with FAKER 0000 ...
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  ... but it only has
  <bold>
   two
  </bold>
  items in it: the first and second of the three messages I just listed.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  So, either FAKER 0000 isn't in my_schedule, or your code doesn't think that ARCH 1120 conflicts with FAKER 0000, or it does notice the conflict but doesn't put a message about the conflict into the
  <code>
   warnings
  </code>
  list.

  Right, one of the hypotheses mentioned above was, "your code doesn't think that ARCH 1120 conflicts with FAKER 0000 "

  So right now, I think error is probably with changeTime.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  Either it's generating the wrong warnings (indeed, it is saying that 1120 conflicts with
  <italic>
   itself
  </italic>
  , which shouldn't be a warning), or
  <italic>
   you think it's changing the time of its
   <code>
    self
   </code>
   but it actually isn't (correctly).
  </italic>
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  So I would suggest checking/printing what all the time-related attributes are for arch1120 before and after line 236
  <code>
   arch1120.changeTime(new_time)
  </code>
  .
  <break>
  </break>
