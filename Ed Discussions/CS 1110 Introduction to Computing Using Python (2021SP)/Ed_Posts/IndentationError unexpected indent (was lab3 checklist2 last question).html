 Hi, I have a question regarding lab3 checklist 2. I changed greetings.py in Atom and save it. But the Powershell won't show the encouraging statement.  I attached the screenshots below.

  Alternately, you can make a new Ed Discussion post where you just show the second screenshot --- the one with the error message.

  From the error message, you can see there was an indentation error at line 26 of greetings.py (the line starting with "reps = ").
 </p>
 <p>
  Python is very strict with indentation, so check that the indentation of that line matches the rest of the function that the line is under. You probably accidentally either over or under indented that line.
