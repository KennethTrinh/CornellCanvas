 I keep getting the error Wrongly found back-and-forth for users A and B at Post 0 for k=2
</p>
<p>
 <break>
 </break>
 for bnf_starts_here(post, u1, u2, k), but when I put print statements into my function in order to understand what list of posts it is returning (by printing post.tag) I see that the list I am returning contains the correct posts. What could be causing this problem?

  While I'm not Professor Lee, I think that the hint to solving that problem is in Section 7.1.1 of the assignment description document:
 </p>
 <p>
  "A back-and-forth of length k between user u1 and (different) user u2 starts at a post P if (and only if) P was written by u1 and ...
 </p>
 <p>
  • Case: k = 1: ... there is no reply to P written by u2. (This includes the case where P has no replies at all). [14]
 </p>
 <p>
  • Case: k ≥ 2: ... there is a back-and-forth of length k − 1 between u2 and u1 starting at some reply to P.
 </p>
 <p>
  [14]: Contrariwise, no back-and-forth of length k = 1 between u1 and u2 starts at P if P wasn’t written by u1 or if there’s a reply to P written by u2."
 </p>

   That makes sense and I think I've solved my original problem. However, now I'm having issues with the rule that back-and-forth's must start on u1. How can I handle a k=3 back-and-forth through recursive calls if my function is always checking if the current post's name is u1?

    On that particular question, I think you can make it so that the name being checked always flips between u2 and u1 with each instance of the recursive function.
