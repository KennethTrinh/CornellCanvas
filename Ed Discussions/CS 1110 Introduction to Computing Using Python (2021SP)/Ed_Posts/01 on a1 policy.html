  On CMS I see that I scored a 0/1 on A1policy. Is this score what we should expect with the 'revision' policy for A1, or is there actually an issue with my policy statement. My feedback didn't indicate an issue with the policy statement.

  Generically, no, this is not expected.

  Please contact your grader (you can determine their netid from CMS) to see what happened; it could be that they combined the grade for the tests and the policy into a single (re)submission count of 1.
