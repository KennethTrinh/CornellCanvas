  Hey!!

  It seems like your menu_listing function is not working properly. Perhaps it's the accumulator aspect of menu_listing, you could be returning the wrong, or your menu_listing function is not properly accustomed to function with dictionaries?

  -Best of luck :)

  As the student says, it could be an issue with menu_listing. Maybe a debug print statement in menu_listing could help? To check the length of
  <code>
   colleges
  </code>
  I(you can call
  <code>
   len
  </code>
  on both lists and dicts), the value of
  <code>
   out
  </code>
  , etc. It's also possible that it's an issue with
  <code>
   process_line
  </code>
  .
