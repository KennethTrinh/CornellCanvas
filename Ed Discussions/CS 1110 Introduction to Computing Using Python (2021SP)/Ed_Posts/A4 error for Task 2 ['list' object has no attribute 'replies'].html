  error message. we are confused as to why it says list object. We were accessing the post attribute replies, not a list for our base case (post with no replies)

  The error says that you're doing the following
 </paragraph>
 <pre> path = response.author + ', ' + user_paths(response.replies)
</pre>
 <paragraph>
  Note that the precondition for user_paths is that whatever you pass in must be a Post object. However, you're passing in a list object, because 'response' is likely your Post object and so 'response.replies' would be the list of post objects.
