  My computer wonâ€™t let me access the pre-lecture videos for 2/25; it keeps redirecting me to a website called panopto instead. Is there anything I can do to fix this?

  You can access Panopto by logging in through Canvas (which uses your Cornell netID). Panopto just hosts videos for Cornell, so it is normal to be redirected there.

  Once you're redirected to Panopto, it should give you the option to log in through Canvas.
