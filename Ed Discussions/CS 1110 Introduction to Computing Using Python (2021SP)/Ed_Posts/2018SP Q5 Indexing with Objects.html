 I tried drawing folders to better understand this question, but I'm still confused about the relationship between holdings, Players, and which folder holds the indices of players. I thought that the holdings attribute held indices, but I'm not sure that's true. Could someone explain the reasoning behind how t1.plist[i1].holdings is written? Thanks!

  Each folder for a Team object has a pList attribute that is a list of ids, each id representing a Player object.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each folder for a Player has a holdings attribute which is an int.
 </p>
 <p>
  t1.plist is therefore a list of player objects
 </p>
 <p>
  t1.plist[i2] is the i2'th player in t1.plist
 </p>
 <p>
  t1.plist[i2].holdings is the value of the holdings attribute for that particular player.
