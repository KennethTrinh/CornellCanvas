  Put in your question title the year, semester, and question.  Ideal would also be to include the topic.   Example: 2018SP Q2(b) - call frames
 </callout>
 <callout type="info">
  Include a screenshot of the question, so readers/answerers don't have to go find the relevant pdf.

  When returning lists, I want to clarify whether we return the actual list [1,2,3,etc.] or the ID of the folder (as lists are objects).
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For example, in this code from 2017SP #6, when asked the return value of the call, wouldn't the value technically be the ID of the list, or does this only apply to drawing the function call frames?

  Since we have no way to know what the id of the list is, we can only answer these questions by indicating the list contents. (Unless you're drawing the diagrams, in which case you
  <italic>
   can
  </italic>
  write the id.)

  But yes, the truth is that the id of the list is what is returned.

  So, consider the answer to that question to be shorthand for  "the id of the list object whose contents are [-1,1]"
