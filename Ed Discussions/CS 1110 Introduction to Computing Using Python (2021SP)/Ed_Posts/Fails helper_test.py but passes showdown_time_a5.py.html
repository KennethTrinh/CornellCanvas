 My partner and I have completed all of the tasks in the Assignment 5 handout (as far as we can tell). When we run the "showdown_time_a5.py" script, everything works, and we can recreate all of the interactions shown in the "sample runs" folder. However, when we run the "helper_test.py" script to check our code for A5, we get the following error:
</p>
<pre>Starting the tests in this module.
Starting test_was_accepted
        Testing with small_test1.txt
                Testing student 11
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ".\helper_tests.py", line 209, in &lt;module&gt;
    test_was_accepted()
  File ".\helper_tests.py", line 89, in test_was_accepted
    twa_helper(tag, tag_accepted_map[tag], colleges)
  File ".\helper_tests.py", line 44, in twa_helper
    if c.name in acceptedlist:
AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'name'</pre>
<p>
 This seems to me to be a problem with the "helper_tests.py" file itself, and not anything to do with the code we wrote. I just want to make sure that we aren't doing something wrong.

  Okay.  To make sure that your code for A5 works, you should see if running the college showdown script from A3 returns the same results as the college showdown script in A5.  The helper tests file In A5 is the same one from A3 I believe, so it is not revised for the purposes of this assignment.  If the helper tests file is returning an error even though the showdown script returns the same results from the script in A3, you should not worry!
