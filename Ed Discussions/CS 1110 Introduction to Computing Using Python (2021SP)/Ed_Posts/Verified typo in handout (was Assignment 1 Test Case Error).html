  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  While starting A1, I noticed that according to the A1 instructions pdf, the given test function "test_from_to()" has
  <italic>
   at least
  </italic>
  two faulty test cases.
 </paragraph>

  But the function only gives three cases - and two have notes in their implementation that they are guaranteed to be correct. This means that only one test case could possibly have an error.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  What should I do?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thanks!

  Sorry, it's a typo: function
  <code>
   test_
   <underline>
    tag
   </underline>
   _endi
  </code>
  is the one with at least two bad test cases!
