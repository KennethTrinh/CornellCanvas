 I wanted to clarify how we should depict if-else statements when drawing diagrams. I understand we should show they are exectuable, but does that mean we should show what the Boolean evaluates to for the if statement in the call frame, or should we just write the line of the if and/or else in the counter and cross it out to show the program flow?

  Just write the line numbers in the program counter - that will be sufficient to show us what the boolean evaluated to.
