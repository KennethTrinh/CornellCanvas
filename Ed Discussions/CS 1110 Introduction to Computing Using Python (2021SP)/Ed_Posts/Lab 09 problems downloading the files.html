  In Lab 09 it asks you to create a new directory with the given files. However, when I click on the hyperlink for the files, instead of downloading it opens the script on a notepad in my browser. Is this a problem on my end or is there something wrong with the links? What should I do about it?

  Hi, can you try the directions from Lab 3, sidenote a?

  [If clicking on a link doesn't cause your computer to ask where you want to download/save the files, see sidenote a.] -&gt; a. Try right-clicking or (control-key)+clicking to get an option like "Download Linked File As" or "Save target as..." or "Save link as".
