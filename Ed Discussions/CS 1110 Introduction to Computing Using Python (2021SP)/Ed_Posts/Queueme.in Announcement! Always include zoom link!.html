 Hi everyone!
</p>
<p>
 Just as a reminder, if you attend office hours you should put a zoom link when you add your name to the queue. You can do this by adding a comment directly to "post" on the queue. This is very important, especially as lines get longer with assignments coming out!

 Thanks everyone :)
