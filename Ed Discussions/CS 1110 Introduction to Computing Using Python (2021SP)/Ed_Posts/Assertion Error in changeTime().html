 We're trying to write changeTime() but are having issues with how to call conflictsWith(). Our error is in the assert statement for conflictsWith(), rather than changeTime(). We're unsure why we keep getting an assertion error when writing our if-statement. Our error message is below.

  newtime is a string, when it should be a course.

   When we called self.conflictsWith, we knew it had to be a course, but newtime isn't a Course attribute so we were unsure about how to call it.
