 When I run my code, the result was missing the section where it showed the student tags for accepted at both; accepted at both, enrolled at XXX1; accepted at both, XXX2. It only showed the number and % section. When I traced back, it seems that showdown_time_a5 is missing the below 2 print statements. When I tried to add these print statements back. that section showed up, which produced the same result as a3. I just want to confirm that the missing section was not caused by other mistakes in my code.

  Okay.
 </p>
 <p>
  I completed my A5, and I ran the showdown script.
 </p>
 <snippet language="py" line-numbers="true" runnable="false">
  <snippet-file id="code">
   Cornell_U vs. Harvard_U
Number of students accepted at both: 12
Number of such students who enrolled at one of them: 10
% who chose Cornell_U over Harvard_U: 10.0
% who chose Harvard_U over Cornell_U: 90.0

  It seem like the student tags part of the show_down script is not necessary or was removed for this assignment? Anyways, it seems like your code is working perfectly fine, so there is nothing to worry about when it comes to anything else besides the results!

  -Hope this helps! :)

  -edit: removed part of my answer that was misguided

   Yep, I removed the small tests on the theory that students already have the solutions for A3, so they wouldn't need to show_sd_internals.
