  On the document outlining A3, it says there is a semi-submission deadline on 3/24 and a final submission deadline on 3/28. However, on the CMS site, it says the semi-submission deadline is 3/31. Which is the correct deadline?

  I have corrected the CMS date (I hit the wrong Wednesday.)  Apologies for that!
