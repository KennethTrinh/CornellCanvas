  Dear instructor,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I submitted the a1first assignment last Friday but today I discovered a small typo by my partner in the guaranteed-correct area. She accidentally added a comma in one of the lines and caused an error. Is this going to affect our grades?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Since this typo happens in the guaranteed correct area, can we do a small update to our submission that is only about this typo?

  Hi, see section 2.1 of the assignment handout about revisions.  So don't worry about the typo for assignment 1!

  Hi, I have the same problem. I discovered some typos in my a1_first.py in the process of completing a1_second.py. I understand from assignment handout section 2.1 that we can revise and resubmit, but the handout doesn't say
  <bold>
   how
  </bold>
  to do this and the portal won't allow a resubmission of a1_first.py at this stage. How does one submit a revision? Thanks!

  Instructions will come after A1 is due (and I believe after grades are out)!
