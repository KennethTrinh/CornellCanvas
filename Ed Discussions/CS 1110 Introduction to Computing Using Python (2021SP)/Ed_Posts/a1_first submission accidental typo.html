 Dear instructor,
</p>
<p>
 I submitted the a1first assignment last Friday but today I discovered a small typo by my partner in the guaranteed-correct area. She accidentally added a comma in one of the lines and caused an error. Is this going to affect our grades?
</p>
<p>
 Since this typo happens in the guaranteed correct area, can we do a small update to our submission that is only about this typo?
</p>

  Hi, see section 2.1 of the assignment handout about revisions.  So don't worry about the typo for assignment 1!

   Hi, I have the same problem. I discovered some typos in my a1_first.py in the process of completing a1_second.py. I understand from assignment handout section 2.1 that we can revise and resubmit, but the handout doesn't say
   <b>
    how
   </b>
   to do this and the portal won't allow a resubmission of a1_first.py at this stage. How does one submit a revision? Thanks!
  </p>

    Instructions will come after A1 is due (and I believe after grades are out)!
