  Hello, everyone! Just a quick question (sorry if it is mentioned on the assignment page, but I did not see the answer to my question). Should we include assert statements in the functions that we write for Assignment 6? I know they are good for debugging, but would you all recommend that we include them or no? Thank you so much for the help!

  You are not required to use assert statements, but feel free to use them if you'd like! As you also mentioned, they can be very useful for debugging (esp. enforcing preconditions).
