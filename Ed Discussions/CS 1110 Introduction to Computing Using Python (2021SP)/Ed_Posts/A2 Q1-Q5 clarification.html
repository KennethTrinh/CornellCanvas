 For Q1-Q5, should we imagine each question as consecutive? As in if Q2 asks what happens when the code is changed, does that change carry through to Q3, or should we think of each question as asking about the original code that's given in a2_objects.py?

  Oh, and I should say: the questions and the assignment aren't asking you to change the code at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  There's no programming in this assignment.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead, the assignment is about analyzing an existing program as is.

   Looking at some of the worked examples (i.e. old A2s and their solutions) mentioned in the handout should make this point clearer.

   Hi!
   <break>
   </break>
   The context for each of Q1-Q5 is that the code above it has been executed. So, for example,
  </p>
  <list style="bullet">
   <li>
    <p>
     Q2 is asking about the situation where where lines 1-43 have been executed,
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Q3 is asking about the situation where lines 1-57 have been executed,
    </p>
   </li>
  </list>
  <p>
   and so on.
  </p>
