 Hi,

 Just making sure I understand what the function is supposed to be returning.

 If we call bnf_starts_here(0, B, C, 3) we want it to return a list that looks like [0.0, 0.0.0, 0.0.0.0] which would correspond to the posts represented by the far left of the tree.

  Hi,  good question!
 </p>
 <p>
  (a) at Post 0, the author is A, so no back-and-forth by B and anybody starts there.  I think you mean at 0.0 .

  </break>
  (b) also, almost, but notquite --- the list returned should be of the Posts, not the Gorn numberstrings (although I think you might have meant that).
