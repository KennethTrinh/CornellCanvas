 Looking at assignment 1, code clean-up involves deleting comments such as "implement this." Does this still apply to this assignment, and do we delete comments like "BELOW THIS LINE"?
</p>
<p>
 Also, are there any other things regarding this assignment specifically that we should clean up?
</p>
<p>
 Thanks in advance!

  I think we said this throughout, but when a comment says something like this ...
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  # STUDENTS: IMPLEMENT THE REST OF process_line BELOW THIS LINE
  <break>
  </break>
  # LEAVE THIS COMMENT IN YOUR SUBMITTED CODE.
 </p>
 <p>
  ...please do NOT delete  such comments, i.e., those  that we ask you to keep in.
 </p>
 <p>
  The graders need those comments to easily see what changes you made vs. what was given.
