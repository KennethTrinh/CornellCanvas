   Hello! I'm still looking for a partner--in Ithaca, happy to do remote, but in-person works too as long as you're down to meet on campus!

      Hello! I'm looking for a partner who is in a time zone similar to mine (I'm currently in Korea which is 14 hours ahead of Ithaca (GMT+9)), but any time zone is still fine as long as we could accomodate for each other. (If you're ok working late at night in EST, it would be great to partner with me.) My email is yp358@cornell.edu, so please don't hesitate to shoot me an email!
     </p>

              If anyone is looking for a partner from this class, you can contact me at bjr226@cornell.edu. I'm on campus so working in Ithaca time, and if you're on campus too we could even get together for assignments. I'm looking forward to it!
