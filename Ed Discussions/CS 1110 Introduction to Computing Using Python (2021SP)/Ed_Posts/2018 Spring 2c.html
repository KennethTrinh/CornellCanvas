<callout type="info">
 Put in your question title the year, semester, and question.  Ideal would also be to include the topic.   Example: 2018SP Q2(b) - call frames
</callout>
<callout type="info">
 Include a screenshot of the question, so readers/answerers don't have to go find the relevant pdf.
</callout>
<p>
 Can someone explain the solution? Thank you

  Hi!  the command changes the lunch price of a LunchItem to be more than 10 dollars.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  The idea is that although the _ _ init _ _ method of LunchItems causes an error if someone tries to set the lunch price to more than 10 dollars, the _ _ init_ _ method cannot prevent someone from directly accessing item2's lunch_price variable.
