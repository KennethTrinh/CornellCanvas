  Put in your question title the year, semester, and question.  Ideal would also be to include the topic.   Example: 2018SP Q2(b) - call frames
 </callout>
 <callout type="info">
  Include a screenshot of the question, so readers/answerers don't have to go find the relevant pdf.
 </callout>

  Hi!  the command changes the lunch price of a LunchItem to be more than 10 dollars.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  The idea is that although the _ _ init _ _ method of LunchItems causes an error if someone tries to set the lunch price to more than 10 dollars, the _ _ init_ _ method cannot prevent someone from directly accessing item2's lunch_price variable.
