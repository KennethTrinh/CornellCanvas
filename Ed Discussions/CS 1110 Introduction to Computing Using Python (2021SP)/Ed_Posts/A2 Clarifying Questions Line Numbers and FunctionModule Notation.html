  Hi, I have two clarifying questions about Assignment 2:
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  In section 7 of a2, it says "In your diagrams, use the line numbers given in Section 9" Are we expected to indicate what line number creates/modifies every variable? Or is it just saying we need to use those lines of code?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I know we're not supposed to put function/modules in the heap space. Do we have to put them in global space or do we just ignore them when they are imported/created?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thank you!

  Hi!

  </break>
  For the first question, we mean that when you put line numbers in the program counter of  call frames (the upper righthand box in each call frame), use the line numbers give in section 9.
  <break>
  </break>
  (So, hint: don't forget to put the line numbers in the right places in the call frames. :) )
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  For the second question: don't include them anywhere in diagrams that you submit for this assignment.

  For the program counter of call frames, do we write the number of the line that was just executed? For example, if a function in line 19 refers to a variable in line 7 to execute would the counter say: 19, 7 or just the number 7

  I think best is to re-view a lecture where Prof. Fan went through the diagramming; it'll be clearer in context with visuals than my trying to convey the experience in just plain text. Or, see some of the worked examples referred to in the assignment handout.
