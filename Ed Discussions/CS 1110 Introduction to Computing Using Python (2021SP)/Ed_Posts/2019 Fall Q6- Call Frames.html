  The solutions for question 6 of Fall 2019 wrote out the call frames differently than we do this semester. Would this be the correct notation to receive points for our exam?

  In general, the differences between fall and spring call frame notation are, besides the "animation" aspect, that spring counts "else:" as an executed line and fall doesn't. So it seems like your first
  <code>
   shred
  </code>
  call frame needs to have the line 6 in the program counter as well.

  Other than that, looks good to my quick eyeball of your answer!
