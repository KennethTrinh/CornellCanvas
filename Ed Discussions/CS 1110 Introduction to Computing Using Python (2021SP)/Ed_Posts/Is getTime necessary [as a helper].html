 I finished implementing getTime, but do we need to call getTime when implementing other functions (will we lose points)? I personally found it a lot easier to make a class attribute for Course that was equal to t, and then use that instead.

  Hi! getTime() was meant more for users (like students using your scheduling code) to call, rather than as a helper for your own code. So your own code doesn't need to call it.
