  Hello,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I know Gradescope accepts images, but Assignment02 asks for us to upload a PDF. Is it alright to upload an image or do we need to submit it as a PDF?

  Thank you!

  if you took pictures use something like adobe scan. it converts the images and compiles a pdf file for you. then if you have a Mac you can air drop it. its super easy to use
