 If a question asks for 3 test cases, but I write down 7 test cases and at least 3 of them are correct, will I lose points if the rest of those test cases are incorrect? I remember that we were allowed to do this on assignment 1, but i'm not sure if this applies to the prelim.
</p>
<p>
 Also just to confirm, we cannot use a calculator on the prelim?

  Confirm, no calculator.

  If test cases are incorrect, then we must deduct credit.

  But if they are merely redundant and we don't ask for non-redundant cases, then we would not deduct credit.
