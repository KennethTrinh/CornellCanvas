  For the heap space do we have to format the folders in order of creation like:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  id1
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  id2
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  id3
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  or can we format the folders to save space and make it more concise like:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  id1 id2
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  id3 id4
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  id5 id6
 </paragraph>
