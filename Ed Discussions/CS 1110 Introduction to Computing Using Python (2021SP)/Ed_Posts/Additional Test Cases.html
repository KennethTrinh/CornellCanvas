 Are we allowed/expected to include additional test cases at the bottom of A4? Will points be deducted for having commented-out test cases at the bottom?

  You are welcome to add additional test cases, but please put them in a4_test.py (which is meant for testing your a4.py code).  That way, you won't submit them to us, and we won't have to look at them (in the interests of grading speed).
