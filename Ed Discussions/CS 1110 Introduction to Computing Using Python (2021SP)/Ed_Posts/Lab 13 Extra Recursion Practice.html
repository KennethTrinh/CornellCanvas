 To study for the prelim, I have been trying to work through the optional recursion practice that was posted along with Lab 13. I know we can test are code, but are there any solutions anywhere for us to look at?

  Unfortunately, we cannot release lab solutions to students as per agreement with other python instructors. There are office hours tomorrow that may be of help!
