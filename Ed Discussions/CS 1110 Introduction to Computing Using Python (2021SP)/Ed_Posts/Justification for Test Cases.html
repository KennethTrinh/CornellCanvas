 For the justification of additional test cases, is it alright if its similar to the ones given to us? e.g.
</p>
<p>
 # 1. tag at beginning (given to us in a1_first.py)
</p>
<p>
 or do we need some longer explanation?
</p>
<p>
 Would #1 tag at beginning be considered a good enough justification?

  Yes! An explanation of why your test covers an edge case, or somehow furthers the correctness of your code (which you can sometimes explain in one sentence) is all you need in the explanation of the test.
