  s.find('x')=edited out
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Hello! there is no x in the string hello world, so I thought python would output an error, but instead, it's a number. I remember in lectures that false would output 0 and true is 1, but I still don't understand the answer.

  Hi!  The Python documentation, linked on the course homepage under item 3 "Frequently accessed servers and sites", explains what builtin functions do.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  Searching there, we find
  <link href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=find#str.find"/>
  documentation for the string method
  <code>
   ffind
  </code>
  (
  <italic>
   sub
  </italic>
  ), and importantly,
  <code>
   find()
  </code>
  returns a special number, -1, if the sought-after substring
  <code>
   sub
  </code>
  is not in the string
  <code>
   str
  </code>
  .

  So, right ---
  <code>
   find()
  </code>
  does not report an error for non-found substrings, whereas
  <code>
   index()
  </code>
  does "throw" an error.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  Keeping
  <code>
   find
  </code>
  and
  <code>
   index()
  </code>
  straight  --- or, actually, knowing how to find the documentation for them --- is just one of those things Python programmers need to learn to do, just like for learners of French, one has to remember that "table" is feminine whereas "livre" is masculine.
