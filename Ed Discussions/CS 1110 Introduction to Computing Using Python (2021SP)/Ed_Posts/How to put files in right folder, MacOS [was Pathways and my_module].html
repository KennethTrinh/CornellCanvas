  Could we create “my_module” on our desktop, or should it be in our personal directory? Like MAC HD. When I cd from terminal, I am not on my own hard drive... I get a list of files that are somewhere else.. How can we create files to open in atom in the right location?

  It's a file
  <code>
   my_module.py
  </code>
  that Prof. Fan demo'd in class, available here:

  These are all very sensible questions!

  That's right; you should be in your "home directory", which probably has the same name as your username.  If you type
  <code>
   pwd
  </code>
  when you are in Terminal, you'll see the directory name.  Here's what happens for me: my home directory on the computer "patagonia" is /Users/ljl2.

 <pre>[ljl2@patagonia ~] pwd 
/Users/ljl2

  Typically, you do not want to have your personal files on your hard drive ("Macintosh HD"), but rather in your home directory.

  This is up to you, but what I would recommend is, unless told to do otherwise (such as in Lab 3) to create a directory (folder) like "cs1110" in your home directory, and then make subfolders for each activity (like "lecture03", "lab00", "lab01", "lab02") inside the cs1110 directory, and put your files in the relevant subfolder.

  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  This way, you'll keep organized, and you don't have to worry about whether you have a file already named "test.py" in lecture02 when you're working within folder lecture03.

  Start a new file in Atom. When you save it, you should get a dialog box, like this:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Next to the "Where" dropdown menu, there's a little button with a tiny "v" or down-arrow on it. Click on that, and you'll get a full-blown Finder window that will let you select the folder in which you wish to save the file
