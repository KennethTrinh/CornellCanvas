 Hello,
</p>
<p>
 The due date for a1_first.py and the policy acknowledgment are due on Friday at 11:59 P.M., but I also see a 2 P.M. deadline.
</p>
<p>
 Are both required?
</p>
<p>
 Tysm!
</p>

  Check Section 2, page 2 of the Assignment 1 handout. You can see instructions about what to turn in by 2pm and what to turn by 11:59pm.
