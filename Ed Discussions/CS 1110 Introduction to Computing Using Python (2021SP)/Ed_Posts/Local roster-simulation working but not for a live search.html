  Hello! I finished making my code for the second part of assignment 1 and it passed all the test cases and works with the local roster-simulation files. But when I try to do the live search I get the "Sorry, something's wrong with the class subject or number or the registrar's website. Maybe this semester that course isn't being run? Enter another course name, like "CS 1110", or "q" to quit: 'CS 1110'" error code. Why is this happening? I don't know if this is relevant, but I have an HP with windows.

  Try doing CS 1110 by itself, no quotation marks

  I've tried with and without quotation marks. Neither work. I've also tried using different classes that I found on the roster.

  Out of curiosity, why do you enter "
  <code>
   py query_roster.py
  </code>
  " instead of "
  <code>
   python query_roster.py
  </code>
  "?  What is "
  <code>
   py
  </code>
  "?
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  If you just hit "return" rather than entering a course name/number, what happens?
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  And ... since consulting hours have started, you may just want to "go" to consulting hours to have someone help you debug.

  "py" is just a "python" equivalent I believe. For some reason, it doesn't work when I put in "python" but does for "py". I think it might have to do with the how Windows works since I get a "Python was not found" error when I use "python".

  If I just press 'return' for live I get the same error message as before ("Sorry, something's wrong...") but it works when I do a local roster-simulation run.

  I actually did go to consulting hours and was then referred to ask on Ed discussion. We established it was not necessarily my code that was causing this, but probably how the code for live
  <underline>
   _data
  </underline>
  _fn interacts with my computer or something of that sort since I do get the correct url.

  Big-picture answer: if your code is working in simulation and your make_url is correct, then you almost surely  don't have to  worry about the live version not working!

  I am suspicious about the "py" vs "python" thing meaning the version of python you are using is not using the packages we expect.
