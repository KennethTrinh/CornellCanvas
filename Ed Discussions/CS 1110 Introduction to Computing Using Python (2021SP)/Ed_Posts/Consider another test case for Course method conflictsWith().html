 The TAs are reporting a perhaps common think-o that we'd like to help students with.

 Consider a situation where you have a Course with a time that "straddles" the noontime border such that the first "hour part" looks like it's at least as big as the second part, like this:
 <break>
 </break>
 <break>
 </break>
 MWF 8:00am-8:00pm
</p>
<p>
 (If that time looks familiar, it's what our test_course_changetime() test function changes the ARCH 1120 TBA course to.)
 <break>
 </break>
 <break>
 </break>
 Does your conflictsWith() method properly report that such a course would conflict with a course that met MWF 9:05am-9:55am ?
