  Hello!
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I was reviewing conditionals and wondered if there were instances in which using an "else" statement would cause problems in the code.  Why is that the case?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  When in doubt should we always add "else" or should we simply end the code with another unindented return statement without adding "else"?

  For our purposes writing something like
 </paragraph>
 <snippet language="py" line-numbers="true" runnable="false">
  <snippet-file id="code">
   if True:
    return 5
else:
    return 6
  </snippet-file>
 </snippet>
 <paragraph>
  works the same as writing
 </paragraph>
 <snippet language="py" line-numbers="true" runnable="false">
  <snippet-file id="code">
   if True:
    return 5
return 6
  </snippet-file>
 </snippet>
 <paragraph>
  Adding the else statement should not cause problems.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  You can do either, but omitting the else is more concise.

  ...although keeping the else statement may make your logic clearer.
