 working on college_named and am running into this error:
</p>
<p>
 TypeError: argument of type 'College' is not iterable
</p>
<p>
 i'm iterating using i and clist. is there a better way to iterate through a list of objects?
</p>

  From the error message it seems like you are not iterating through a list but through an object of type College, so make sure to iterate through a list!
 </p>
 <p>
  Maybe you called college_named and used a College object as the clist parameter, or you are iterating through an object that is inside the clist rather than the clist itself.

   Hmm... I’m iterating through clist which I understood to be a list of objects. My code doesn’t mention College

    I'm sorry I can't be of much help without looking at your code (I highly recommend going to consulting hours), but the error code is saying exactly that: you are trying to loop through a College object rather than a College list
