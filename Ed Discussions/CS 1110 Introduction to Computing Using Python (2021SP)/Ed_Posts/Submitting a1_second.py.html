 On CMSX I only see a place to submit a1first.py but I don't see a place to submit a1_second.py. I was wondering how I could submit it.

  (Documentation: Section 2 "Timeline and Deadlines", item 4:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  Sometime on Saturday, Mar 6, we will transfer the CMS groupings you made in Deadline 1 to a “new” CMS assignment for a1_second.py, and open it for submission. (This implies that you cannot change partners for a1_second.py.)

   You will be able to submit it in a different 'assignment' (assignment 1 part b, so not an actual different assignment) in CMS! It has not been put in CMS yet, but it will be due March 8th so no need to worry for now.
