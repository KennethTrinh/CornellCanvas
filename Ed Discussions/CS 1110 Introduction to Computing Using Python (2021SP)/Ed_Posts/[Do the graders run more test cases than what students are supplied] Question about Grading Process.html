  This may be a silly question but are there more tests run when the assignment is graded than are given to us in the testing files?

  Yes, it is often the case that more test cases are run by the graders than what are supplied to students.

  But the test cases given to students are meant to give good coverage of potential situations.

  (So, passing all given test cases is a good sign.  But students should feel empowered to think about whether there are more they should add.)
