  I'm working on a code, but can't seem to find a string method that gives me everything right of the colon (the minutes sections). I tried index, but my answer contains the colon in it. This prevents me from adding my 2 ints together.

  When string slicing starting at a certain index, if you do something like string[index:] youâ€™ll get the string starting from index. If you want to get the string starting from the character right after the index, how can you change index to do that?

  This is an example of what I'm talking about. The 0 disappears for some reason.

  Thanks, I solved that but now I have a new problem. For some reason, if the minutes has a 0 (ex. 12:04), then the 0 doesn't show in the final answer. But if it has both digits (ex. 12:11), then both digits will show.

  bear in mind that if you convert a string containing a number to an integer, it will lose its leading zeroes
