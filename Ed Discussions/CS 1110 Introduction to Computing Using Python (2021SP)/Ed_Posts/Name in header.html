  Do we need to put our name in the header for assignments or replace the "#Skeleton by Prof. Lillian Lee (LJL2), Apr 2021" with our own name?

  I'm confused because the code cleanup instructions from Assignment 1 just says to list whoever contributed to the code without a specification for writing out our name, so I only included my net ID and the names of TAs I consulted at the top, but I got a deduction saying "you did not not change your name as comment header in any of your files" for A3?

  Looked at your submission and you correctly modified the headers. You should submit a regrade request!
