 I'm working on something that apparently requires python 3.8. I recall in the installation instructions for this course that we were supposed to install 3.7, not 3.8 for some reason. Is it a big problem if I update python?

  We here in Spring 2021 actually recommended 3.8.5 --- it's the fall semester that requires 3.7.  So 3.8 is fine!
