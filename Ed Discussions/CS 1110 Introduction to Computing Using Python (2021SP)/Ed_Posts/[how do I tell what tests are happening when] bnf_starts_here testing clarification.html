  When testing bnf_starts_here, is it supposed to have text stating what case is being tested as in num_user_posts and user_paths? I'm just confused if I'm editing my code in the right direction since the cases listed in the error messages are changing but I don't know where in the testing order it is.

  We did not include such printouts for everything being tested,  because there are a
  <italic>
   lot
  </italic>
  of tests in
  <code>
   test_bnf_starts_here()
  </code>
  ; rather, for that testing function, we only had print statements (actually, assertion messages)  only for when a problem was detected.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  However, you should feel empowered to add such print statements for all tests, successful or not, if you would find that helpful.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  As an alternative, you could use the technique suggested in the handout's section 7.1.3,  "Optional: If you want to do additional testing".
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  If you go the route of adding print statements to the function
  <code>
   test_bnf_starts_here()
  </code>
  , for how to do that and to understand the testing order:  looking at lines 298 through 332, you can see that the testing code is running through some nested for-loops:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <pre>for u1 in unames:   # possible u1 users
    for u2 in unames: # possible u2 users
        if u1 == u2:
            continue  # skip case where u1 and u2 are the same
         for k in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]: # check values of k from 1 to 5 inclusive
             for post in main_posts:  # for every Post in the main example tree
                 result = a4.bnf_starts_here(post, u1, u2, k) ### &lt;-- where we call your code</pre>
 <paragraph>
  So notice that for each user pair u1 and u2, we first, for k =1, check the results for all the Posts in the main example tree; then, for k=2, check the results for all the Posts in the main example tree, and so on.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  Note that our error messages have a form like:
 </paragraph>
 <pre>                        errormsg = "Wrongly found back-and-forth for users " + \
                               u1 + " and " + u2 + \
                               " at Post " + post.tag  + \
                               " for k=" + str(k)
</pre>
 <paragraph>
  You could create a similar string and print it right before the line
  <code>
   result = a4.bnf_starts_here(...)
  </code>
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  But be warned that would create a lot of input.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  You could reduce the number of tests being run by altering any of the for-loop headers.
  <break>
  </break>
  For example, here's what I would do to just test the cases of k being 1:
  <break>
  </break>
  I would edit line 302 like this:
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  <code>
   for k in [1]: #@ change back to: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:
  </code>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  That "#@" is my own personal marker for "something I commented out that I need to remember to change back".  When I think I'm done with a debugging edit like the above, I undo it.  And I search for any "#@" markers to make sure I didn't forget to undo any other changes.  You can pick your own special marker.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  Similarly, you could decide you don't want to test all Posts, but just the one at, say, 0.0.1, by changing line 306 to:
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  <code>
   for post in gnlist2plist(["0.0.1"], main_dict): #@  change back to: main_posts:
  </code>
 </paragraph>

  Thank you so much for the tips! I just have another question. When I try to print the result or add it to the error message, it gives me a list like
 </paragraph>
 <snippet language="py" line-numbers="true" runnable="true">
  <snippet-file id="code">
   RuntimeError: Wrongly found back-and-forth for users A and B at Post 0 for k=1[&lt;post.Post object at 0x000001E69C42BD00&gt;]
  </snippet-file>
 </snippet>
 <paragraph>
  How should I make it so it's just the post object, or is this a problem with how I wrote my code?

  I think it's an issue with your code; there shouldn't be a k=1 b-n-f for A and B at Post 0, but your code seems to be returning a list of length 1.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  (No b-n-f there for k=1 because it would be enclosed in a longer b-n-f starting at the same Post at 0)

  is there any way to decipher the post object at the id given by running the test (where it says [&lt;post.Post obejct at ...&gt;]?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Looking at the test case for post 0 from A to B at k=3, I return a list of three post objects with that format, but I can't tell what those posts are and i am getting the "wrongly found" error. I'm fairly certain I am supposed to get a list of 3 objects with this case, but I don't know where to go from here since I'm not sure which posts its returning if not the right ones.

  Yes!  Take a look at the body of function we suggest you might want to use in section 7.1.3 for running a small test.  You can loop through the result, and for each item in the result, print its tag attribute:
  <break>
  </break>
 </paragraph>
 <pre>def my_own_private_testfn():
    print("**** Running my own private test function!")
    [main_tree, main_dict] = main_example_tree()
    result = bnf_starts_here(main_dict["0"], "A", "D", 2) # replace with whatever test you like
    if result:
        print("\tHere's the length-2 back-and-forth I found at 0 for A and D") # change as appropriate
        for p in result:
            print(p.tag + " by " + p.author)
    else:
        print("No such back-and-forth here!")
print("**** Done with my own private test function!")
</pre>
