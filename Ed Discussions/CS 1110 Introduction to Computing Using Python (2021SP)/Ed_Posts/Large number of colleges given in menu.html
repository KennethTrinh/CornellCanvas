 Hello, I was looking over my code one more time before submitting and when using sd_utilities_list to run showdown_time there are over a thousand options given by the menu, but the function works fine otherwise (attached screenshot). When using sd_utilities_dict, however, it seems to run perfectly fine. Is this an indication of a problem in my while loop in sd_utilities_list?

   A correct solution will print two-hundred-something colleges, yes. Your
   <code>
    process_line
   </code>
   seems to be producing duplicates. This could mean that it is mistakenly not finding an outcome/enrollment school in
   <code>
    clist
   </code>
   , and is unnecessarily creating a new College and adding it to
   <code>
    clist
   </code>
   .  It definitely could be a problem with your while loop.
