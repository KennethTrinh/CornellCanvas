  In the assignment details it says to submit the answers as comments in a2_objects.py, so should we just paste in the entire contents of the file onto a blank pdf page? Or should we only paste in the commented sections that contain the questions? Or should we include a link to the file within the pdf (How would one do this?)? Or is there another, better way that I'm not seeing?

  Hi!  Sorry you were worried!   The assignment doesn't say that the answers should be in comments; it says that the
  <italic>
   question
  </italic>
  s  appear as comments.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  So, don't submit any code!  Just write your
  <italic>
   answers
  </italic>
  to the questions in the file you submit.
