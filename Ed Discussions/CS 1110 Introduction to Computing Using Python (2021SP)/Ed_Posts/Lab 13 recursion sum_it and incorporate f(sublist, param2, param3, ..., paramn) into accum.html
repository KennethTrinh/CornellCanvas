 We're given the advice:
</p>
<p>
 "So, for a function
 <code>
  f(x,param2, param3, ..., paramn)
 </code>
 on a potentially nested list
 <code>
  x
 </code>
 , the following code structure is common.
</p>
<pre>        if x is empty or isn't a list or is otherwise un-separable:
            return the right results for base cases
        else:
            accum = some initial value
            for sublist in x:
                incorporate f(sublist, param2, param3, ..., paramn) into accum
            return accum
           </pre>
<p>
 However, I'm not sure how to "incorporate f(sublist, param2, param3, ..., paramn) into accum" using recursion. I know that we have to sum each element and accumulate this sum, but I do not see how we can do this recursively.

  By calling f(sublist, param2, param3, .....) you are using recursion.
 </p>
 <p>
  Consider calling sum_it on the nested list [[1, 2], [3, 4]]. We know that the sum of that function call must be the result of sum_it([1, 2]) plus the result of sum_it([3, 4]). By calling sum_it on the sublists we are using recursion, and by adding them we are accumulating the sum.
