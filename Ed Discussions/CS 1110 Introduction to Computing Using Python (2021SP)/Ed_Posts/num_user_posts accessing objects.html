  Hi I am confused about how once you have the tag/gorn you access the corresponding object since it is just an attribute of it.

  Hi! I can think of several interpretations of your question, and will do my best to answer all of them.

  Overall, your question is a good one, because it isn't obviously easy to go from a tag to an object with that tag.

  If you mean, "within
  <code>
   num_user_posts
  </code>
  how do I access the Post object itself?", the specification says that the input
  <code>
   post
  </code>
  will be a Post object, not a Gorn numberstring. So you are given the Post object itself as input.

  If you mean in testing, do you mean you are curious about being able to access a Post with a particular Gorn numberstring and you have already executed the statement
  <code>
   [main_tree, main_dict] = main_example_tree()
  </code>
  ?
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  If so,
  <code>
   main_dict
  </code>
  is a dictionary that maps Gorn numberstrings to Posts; so,
  <code>
   main_dict["0"]
  </code>
  evaluates to the Post at 0,
  <code>
   main_dict["0.0.1"]
  </code>
  evaluates to the post at 0.0.1, and so on.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  ...............

 <paragraph>
  If we hadn't given you that
  <code>
   main_dict
  </code>
  in order to make your life easier, then give a tag, you would have probably no choice but to recursively find the Post with that tag, starting from the Post at 0.
