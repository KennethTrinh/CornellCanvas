 Hi, earlier today I signed up for a one-on-one meeting so I could get help on some of the Lecture 5 material, however when I entered the provided zoom link the host never appeared. I'm not sure if that time slot was already taken, if so when signing up for one-on-ones how do we know that we got the time slot we wanted? Thanks
</p>

  Oh my gosh, I'm

   very

  sorry that happened!

  The overall situation is that the timeslot you sign up for on CMS is
  <i>
   guaranteed:
  </i>
  the system removes timeslots that have been taken by someone else from the available pool.    You should be able to see the timeslot you've gotten by returning to the "assignment"

  Here's the weird thing: I actually remember seeing you signed up for a 1-1, but now I see you as
  <i>
   "
  </i>
  Unassigned.
  <i>
   "
  </i>
  My guess is that a staff member (I really hope it wasn't me!) accidentally hit "remove"?

  Given this, please sign up for a different timeslot for a 1-1, with my sincere apologies for the error.

  : if you remember what timeslot you had signed up, can you reply here and we'll figure out how was the person offering that timeslot and figure out what happened? (It's possible the TA/consultant had to cancel at the last minute for some emergency.)
