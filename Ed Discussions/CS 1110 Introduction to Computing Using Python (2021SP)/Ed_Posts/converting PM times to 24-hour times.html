 Hello, I was wondering if, for the purpose of comparing times between two courses, we would be able to convert PM times into time on a 24-hour clock (aka military time). For example, if a function were to use the hours of a class that starts at 2:00PM, it would convert the time to 14:00 just for the purpose of comparison with the times of other courses. Thanks!
</p>

  Hi!

  You can definitely do that "locally", as in store the military/24-hour time in a local variable or a new attribute!

  But you must respect the "contract" that getTime() returns a string in "roster format", with the proper am/pm suffix attached.

   Thanks! Yup, I only did the conversion in a helper function that returned the earlier course when two were compared, so it should (presumably) be fine since I didn't change any attributes for the Course objects

   Hi,
  </p>
  <p>
   There is nothing on the A6 document that prevents the use of this strategy unless the course instructors say otherwise in response to your post.
