  Hello, I was wondering if, for the purpose of comparing times between two courses, we would be able to convert PM times into time on a 24-hour clock (aka military time). For example, if a function were to use the hours of a class that starts at 2:00PM, it would convert the time to 14:00 just for the purpose of comparison with the times of other courses. Thanks!

  Hi,

  There is nothing on the A6 document that prevents the use of this strategy unless the course instructors say otherwise in response to your post.

  You can definitely do that "locally", as in store the military/24-hour time in a local variable or a new attribute!

  But you must respect the "contract" that getTime() returns a string in "roster format", with the proper am/pm suffix attached.

  Thanks! Yup, I only did the conversion in a helper function that returned the earlier course when two were compared, so it should (presumably) be fine since I didn't change any attributes for the Course objects
