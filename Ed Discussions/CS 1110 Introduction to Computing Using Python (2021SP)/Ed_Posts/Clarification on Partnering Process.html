 I had a question regarding the partner system within the course.
</p>
<p>
 On the assignment page for A1, there's an option that says you can invite members which seemed a little contradictory to the partner matching system.
</p>
<p>
 When you are assigned partners, is it required that you partner up with strictly that person for the rest of the semester? Can you switch partners at any time?
</p>
<p>
 I just wanted a little clarification on the whole partner system and the limits of it.

  for about during a  semester, and the "group divorce" policy referred to in A1 about during the course of an assignment.

   The partner service acts merely as a way for us to suggest a possible partner to you - there is no obligation for you to actually work with the partner you get matched with!
