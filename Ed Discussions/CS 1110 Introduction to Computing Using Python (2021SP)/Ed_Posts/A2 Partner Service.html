  I unfortunately thought that the A2 partner service deadline was Sunday evening instead of saturday evening by mistake and the deadline just passed.. Is there any way to still apply to the service?

  I'm unsure of whether or not my partner service submission went through (had some problems with CMS). So, I'm still looking for a partner if you're interested.

  There was an odd number of students who signed up for the partner service; allow me to see if there is a partner available
