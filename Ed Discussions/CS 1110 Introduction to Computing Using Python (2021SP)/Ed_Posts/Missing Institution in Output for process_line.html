 My dictionary output for showdown_time_a5.py prints out every institution except The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art. Is this one different from the rest of the College objects?

  Have you made sure to append colleges not already in cdict to cdict and making sure they are college objects?

   Yes, the other ones were appended. Every other one showed up when I used the second data file but theres a couple more missing when I use the third.

    a possibility is that you are appending colleges to cdict that are not in cdict but you are not doing that in the case the tag enrolls into a college that is not in cdict, but that is a guess. Perhaps you can share a screenshot of your menu when you run the showdown script to your post? that would be helpful

     The second one is showdown time with dictionaries but the same thing happens when I use lists

  Looking at the 2nd data file, small_cornell_and_suny_test.txt, it looks like Cooper Union is an example where a student was able to enroll in something they didn't apply to. See lines 41-45 in process_line on page 3 of A5 writeup:
  <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs1110/2021sp/assignments/assignment5/a5.pdf">
   https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs1110/2021sp/assignments/assignment5/a5.pdf
  </a>
  . Make sure that you are also adding these to your cdict as well.
