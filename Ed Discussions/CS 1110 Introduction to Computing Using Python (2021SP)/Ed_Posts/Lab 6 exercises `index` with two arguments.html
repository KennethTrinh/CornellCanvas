 Can someone justify why python gives answers as indicated in the following questions?
</p>
<p>
 Thank you! :)
</p>
<p>
 s = 'HeLLo WorLd!'
</p>
<p>
 s.index('L',5)=(edit:answers)
</p>
<p>
 's'.index('s')=(edit:answers)
</p>

  While you can just input it in the console, I edited your question to not include answers to the lab (erring on the safe side).

  The way index works when you input a number as an argument for the second parameter, you are basically saying "start looking for the first 'L' you can find AFTER index 5". It won't find anything before index 5.
 </p>
 <p>
  For the second one, you can see that you are not looking for the index of 's' in s (which is the variable that contains  'HeLLo WorLd!'), you are looking for the index of 's' in 's' (which is just a string, 's')
