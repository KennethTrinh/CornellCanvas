  Could you send a screenshot of what you see on CMS? The assignment settings are set to accept regrade requests until the 20th

  Yikes.  But I notice the "Choose File" button looks like it's active; if you try to resubmit (by choosing a file), does the "Upload" button become active again? That is, can you, in fact, resubmit the file, despite what the top line of CMS says?

  My theory is that the "Submissions for this assignment ..." line is actually false; but let us see!

  It's been reported that re-uploads fail. Hence, I will file a helpdesk ticket with the IT people now!

  Looks like someone was able to submit A1 Part B at 6:32pm and 5:52 pm, but the last A1 Part A upload was 4:39pm.

  Sysadmin response: "We just did a re-deploy of the CMSX code and the dev team said this functionality was tested. I will look into this immediately" and "Can you confirm that this problem is occurring in the classic UI? I think the class is using classic, but I wanted to be sure that it's not a problem with the new Beta UI.""

  The sysadmins report that "the hotfix for the late submissions has been deployed".

  Please reply to this "answer" if the issue seems to still be occurring!

  Hi, when I try to resubmit part B I don't even have the red-lettered message saying that an extension has been granted and can't upload any new file. Any suggestions? SS included below for clarity.

  Apologies, the extension wasn't set for you correctly.  Should be fixed now; please let us know if not!
