    I see a grade for you; I will ask the head staff to try to figure out what's going on with Gradescope.

      Wild speculation: have you made all your Covid testing?  The university has been shutting off Canvas access for students who missed appointments, and it's possible that this could propagate to Gradescope (which is synced with Canvas).

      While this doesn't seem likely, is it at least a possibility in your case?
