 For lab 12, I see that alist is a list, but when I made my function and entered it into the lab box, it responds with error, "Warning: I didn't detect a use of `range` in your function body.". Do we need to use a for loop with range for this lab?

  Hi,
 </p>
 <p>
  It is our belief that trying to use the a for-loop without range will lead to the function not working.

  Indeed, below the warning, did the lab verifier report that your code isn't doing the right thing?

  (Sometimes you don't need to use range(...), but sometimes you do; depends on the specific problem you're trying to solve.)

   when you are looping through a range, is it correct that you cannot modify the values of a list? I am trying to use append and delete for each item in the list, but am not seeing anything happening to my list.

    You

    modify the values of a list when looping based on a range, but it has to be done in the right way.

    The lab 12 question is an important one that is non-obvious.  I suggest trying it out in Python Tutor to see what is going on.
