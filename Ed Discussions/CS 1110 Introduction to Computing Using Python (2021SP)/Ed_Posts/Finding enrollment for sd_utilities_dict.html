  In sd_utilities_list we had to check for enrollment (like for gap year)â€”do we have to check for this as well in sd_utilities_list, or only check for scname? (the specification doesn't seem to say anything about enrollment for either method of implementation, but it was written into the code of sd_utilities_list)

  for the dictionary's process_line?

  yes, your dictionary process_line should handle adding "enrollment entries that weren't in any outcomes" to cdict
