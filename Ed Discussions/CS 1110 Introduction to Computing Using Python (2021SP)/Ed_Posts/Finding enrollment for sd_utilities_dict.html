 In sd_utilities_list we had to check for enrollment (like for gap year)â€”do we have to check for this as well in sd_utilities_list, or only check for scname? (the specification doesn't seem to say anything about enrollment for either method of implementation, but it was written into the code of sd_utilities_list)

 Thank you!

  Yes -- both list and dictionary implementations should have the same functionality!

   So we need
  </p>
  <heading level="1">
   <i>
    apparently "enrolled" in something they didn't apply to, like "gap year"
   </i>
  </heading>
  <p>
   for the dictionary's process_line?
  </p>

    yes, your dictionary process_line should handle adding "enrollment entries that weren't in any outcomes" to cdict
