  Try checking for why your code failed to add AEP 3560 to the StudentSchedule "My Plan A".
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  Can you copy/paste in the entire error message, so we can see which line in the test code is failing?

  OK!  So take a look at the testing code:
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
 </paragraph>
 <snippet language="py" line-numbers="true" runnable="false">
  <snippet-file id="code">
   initial_courses_to_add = roster_creation.make_initial_course_list()
    roster = roster_creation.make_sample_roster(initial_courses_to_add)

    my_schedule = StudentSchedule("My Plan A")

    test_courses = [roster.courses["CS 1110 LEC 001"],
                    roster.courses["AEP 3560 LEC 001"],
                    roster.courses["FAKER 0000 LEC 002"]]             
    for c in test_courses:
        my_schedule.add(c)

    for c in test_courses:
        # Test that the list of schedules c is in is correct; should be in two.
        assert set(c.in_schedules) == set([my_schedule, roster]), \
            _assert_msg(c.name + ".in_schedules", \
                        ['Cornell Fall 21 roster', 'My Plan A'],
                        c.getScheduleNames())
  </snippet-file>
 </snippet>
 <paragraph>
  Line 14-17 is where the assertion error is coming from.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  What's happening?  Line 9-10 is using
  <bold>
   your
  </bold>
  code to add each course in test_courses to the new StudentSchedule with name "My Plan A".  Each such course is already in the "Cornell Fall 21 roster" Schedule.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  The testing in lines 12-17 check whether the
  <code>
   in_schedules
  </code>
  attribute of each course that was supposedly added was correct.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  So, it looks like your code correct has CS1110's
  <code>
   in_schedules
  </code>
  attribute correct, but it is failing to make AEP 3560's
  <code>
   in_schedules
  </code>
  correct --- because it isn't adding the "My Plan A" schedule to that
  <code>
   in_schedules
  </code>
  list.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  So, you need to debug your
  <code>
   add
  </code>
  method for StudentSchedules (since "My Plan A" is a StudentSchedule) to figure out why it isn't working on AEP 3560.  Maybe because your code thinks it's a time conflict with CS1110?
