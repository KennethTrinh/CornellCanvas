 If we introduce a new variable to function as a loop variable in the function process_line, would it be okay for us to simply name the variable loop_variable, or should we provide a further comment? This is in regard to the warning about introducing new variables. Thanks!

   It was mentioned in the while-loop range video (lesson 26.3) by Professor White and I used it in the same way he demonstrated it. Essentially, I used it as a replacement to range(), so I started loop_variable at 0, and incremented it by 1 every time the while loop ran

  Yes, I think the grader will understand what the variable is for. You could even name it something like
  <code>
   i
  </code>
  , since that's a common convention for loop variables; just initialize the variable shortly before using it (not too far in advance), so that it's clear what it's used for
