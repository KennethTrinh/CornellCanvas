 My code works and passes all the tests on my local but when i upload it I get
</p>
<p>
 The call pigify('ask') crashed on execution.
 <break>
 </break>
 The call pigify('quiet') crashed on execution.
 <break>
 </break>
 The call pigify('tomato') crashed on execution.
 <break>
 </break>
 The call pigify('use') crashed on execution.
 <break>
 </break>
 The call pigify('quay') crashed on execution.
 <break>
 </break>
 The call pigify('school') crashed on execution.
 <break>
 </break>
 The call pigify('you') crashed on execution.
 <break>
 </break>
 The call pigify('qu') crashed on execution.
</p>
<p>
 Fairly certain I formatted it right as it appears properly under the provided code section.
</p>
<p>
 Is this a problem on my end or the server?

  You are using a helper function in your pigify function that is not in your code
 </p>
 <p>
  EDIT:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  The my_find function is also in pigify.py, but it has a comment at top that says "students do not need to use this directly," which should probably be changed to "students should not use this directly". Basically, you should not be using the my_find function.

   I am using the default helpers included with the pigify.py file and the question only asks for the pigify function body? Do I need to include the other function bodies too?

    I just noticed that the my_find function is also in pigify.py, but it has a comment at top that says "students do not need to use this directly," which should probably be changed to "students should not use this directly". Basically, you should not be using the my_find function.
