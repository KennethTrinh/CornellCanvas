  Which recorded lectures link? Like previous classes’ lecture recordings?
  <break>
  </break>
  They seem to be working for me, maybe Panopto was down for a bit and they’re working now?

  I have a feeling this is a campus wide Panopto / Canvas issue. I can't sign into Panopto via Canvas at all right now, even if I don't use the specific links for this course.

  From Professor Fan:
 </paragraph>
 <blockquote>
  IT is looking into it and they do suspect that it's related to the earlier Canvas outage. For now I've added alternative links to the videos via VOD on the course website
