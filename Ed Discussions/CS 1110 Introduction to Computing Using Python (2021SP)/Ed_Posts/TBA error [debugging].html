  Two courses being compared are producing false from a line detecting if the string time is TBA but neither are TBA. (CS1110 and INFO2450). How is this possible? we put return string w the line of the false statement so we know this line is causing a false when it should continue the code.

  Hi!  You'll need to use print statements to debug.

  You've isolated what line is causing the False; so it must be that some variables have values your aren't expecting.  Put in print statements for the variables that are involved to see what their values are, and compare these values with what you expect.
