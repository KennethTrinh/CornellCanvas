  Section 201 with Kevin Cook has announced that it is online -- Section-201 students should have received a Canvas announcement from their section leader.

  I believe Section 205 with Mack Wu was planning to be online;

   Yes, I've already send out emails to students in section 202 through the Canvas email system.
