 <paragraph>
  Are the test cases we are to add supposed to be different from those already provided?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Can they fall under the same category of conditions as provided?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For instance, one test case was provided under each condition. Are we supposed to just add a few to it?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Or search for different test cases?

  You are free to add to them, but we are looking more for “test coverage,” which is that the tests you make cover “more” or prove more the correctness of your code. That is, make test cases that cover other aspects of your code being correct, more specifically edge cases or interesting/special inputs that align with the precondition and that maybe you wouldn’t think about when actually coding it up (inputs that work but aren’t what one would say “normal”).
