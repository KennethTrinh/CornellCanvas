  Just to be sure, when answering questions 1-5 should we also be changing our diagram based on the execution of the functions/assignments associated with the questions? For example, when executing recommend(martha, ryan) for Q2, should we change the affected attribute in our diagram, or is this function solely used to answer the question?

  Yes, the idea is to trace what would happen if (all) the code were actually executed, so yes, the diagram should include the updates that, for example, recommend(..) would cause to have happen.
