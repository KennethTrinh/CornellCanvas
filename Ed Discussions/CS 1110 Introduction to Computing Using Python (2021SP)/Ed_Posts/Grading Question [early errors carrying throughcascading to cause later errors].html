  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If we wrote the wrong id number for a variable in global space (i.e. id 6 instead id 5) but within a call frame we carried it through and used it correctly given the mismatched id number, should we still get full points off?

  Generally, if you make a mistake earlier on, then we assume that mistake is correct for the remainder of the problem. This certainly sounds like one of those situations; submit a regrade request and we will review the points deducted.
