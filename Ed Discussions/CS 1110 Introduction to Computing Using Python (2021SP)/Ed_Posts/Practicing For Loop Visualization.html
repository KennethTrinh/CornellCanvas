 Is there anywhere we can practice visualization for 'for-loop/nested for-loop' type questions? I understand that theoretically, we could plug in any of the functions we've written into python tutor, but I'm wondering if there is a formal worksheet or pset that might relate to this.

  Have you done the for loop section of the lab yet? I believe that would be good practice. In addition, nearly all of the practice exams in the archive have loop questions, so I would recommend them as well.

  In terms of visualization for nested for loops, that can be tricky. One way I like to think about it: the outer loop sets the bounds for the inner loop. For example: if the outer loop's index is at 0, then the inner loop's range is 0-0. When the outer loop increments to 1, now the inner loop's range is 0-1.
 </p>
 <p>
  Try an example for yourself. Here is one to get you started, and I would recommend playing around with the lengths of the lists to see what happens.
 </p>
 <snippet language="py" line-numbers="true" runnable="true">
  <snippet-file id="code">
   inner = ["a", "b", "c"]
outer = ["x", "y", "z"]

for i in range(len(inner)):
  for j in range(len(outer)):
     print(i, j)
  </snippet-file>
 </snippet>
 <p>
  You can also do similar experiments with for loops without using range.
