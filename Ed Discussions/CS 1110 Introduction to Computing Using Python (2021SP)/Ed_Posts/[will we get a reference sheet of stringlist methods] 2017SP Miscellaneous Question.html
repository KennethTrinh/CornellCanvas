 On the prelim, will we get a (non comprehensive) sheet with string and list methods as in the spring 2017 prelim 1?

  Decision: we will not be pre-announcing the contents of any function/method specification list.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  You will be expected to know the syntax and specification for list and string slicing (the [:] notation, the index() method for strings and lists, and the append() method for strings without the aid of a reference sheet.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  But we will provide specifications for methods/functions/operators that we don't expect you would already know from doing the assignments and labs.

   From the Prelim 1 study guide:, first page: "We will announce later whether or not a function-specification list will be given and/or its contents announced. (We need to figure out how to treat online and in-person exams equally.)"

    Thank you! I saw that but wasn't sure if I had missed a subsequent announcement (so I am glad that I didn't)!

     Makes sense to double-check!
     <break>
     </break>
     <break>
     </break>
     For studying purposes, assume that you will
     <i>
      not
     </i>
     be given one, since that is safer.
     <break>
