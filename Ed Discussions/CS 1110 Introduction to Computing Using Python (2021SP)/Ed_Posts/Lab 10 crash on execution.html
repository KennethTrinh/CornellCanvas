  Hello what does it mean when the lab says:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The call pigify('ask') crashed on execution.
  <break>
  </break>
  The call pigify('quiet') crashed on execution.
  <break>
  </break>
  The call pigify('ssssh') crashed on execution.
  <break>
  </break>
  The call pigify('tomato') crashed on execution.
  <break>
  </break>
  The call pigify('use') crashed on execution.
  <break>
  </break>
  The call pigify('quay') crashed on execution.
  <break>
  </break>
  The call pigify('school') crashed on execution.
  <break>
  </break>
  The call pigify('you') crashed on execution.
  <break>
  </break>
  The call pigify('qu') crashed on execution.
  <break>
  </break>
  The call pigify('pssst') crashed on execution.
 </paragraph>

  Does that mean it just returned the incorrect pigify version of the word or something else?

  It likely means that your code is crashing. If you download the lab files (linked toward the top of the lab exercise), you can test your solution on your computer with terminal - you will probably get a more helpful error message than from the lab system.

  For me, I had that same error, and it was because I accidentally used my_find when we aren't allowed to call that for our solution
