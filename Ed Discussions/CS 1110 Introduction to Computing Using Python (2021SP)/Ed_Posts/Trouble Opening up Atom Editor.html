  For some reason, when ever I try to open my Atom Editor no window appears. Restarted my computer a couple times and tried to quit the Atom application but nothing seems to be working. Does anyone have recommendations on what to do next?

  This was also happening to me as well on mac. I found that when I force quit (CMD-OPTION-ESC) Atom it would usually open up afterwards.
