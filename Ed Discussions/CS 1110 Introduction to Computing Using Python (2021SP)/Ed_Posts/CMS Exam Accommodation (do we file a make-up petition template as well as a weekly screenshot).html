  On CMS, there is only an option to upload a weekly screenshot of our schedule. Where do we upload the text file template (that details why we are requesting for accommodation)?

  Thanks for carefully reading over the exam policies and makeup template page!

  You are right that that page says "Unless otherwise specified, follow the directions in the make-up petition template", so your question is a good one!

  The exam setup is so complicated this semester that we're going to rely on our wonderful course administrative assistant Ms. Amy Elser, and for various reasons it made sense for her to use the Part A CMS format rather than the text template we usually use.

  In "Prelim 1 alternate time/format request, Part A" on CMS, if you take the 'quiz', you will be able to input the information that the template asks you for as text in the second question.
