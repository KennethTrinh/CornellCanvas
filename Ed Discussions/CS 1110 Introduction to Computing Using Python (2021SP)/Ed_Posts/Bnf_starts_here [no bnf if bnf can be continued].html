  For the post with tag (0), when asked to return a BNF with k = 1, the test cases indicate that the function should return false since the bnf with k = 1 forms part of a larger pattern.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  But, aren't the possible bnfs, for any length, for A and B at Post 0:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  [A -&gt; B -&gt; A] and [A]
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Isn't A a bnf of itself?

  Formal definition of bnf, section 7.1.1., says that for k=1, it has to be that "there is no reply to P written by u2. (This includes the case where P has no replies at all)"
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  Or, as the rewording at footnote 14 says, "Contrariwise, no back-and-forth of length k = 1 between u1 and u2 starts at P if P wasn’t written by u1 or if there’s a reply to P written by u2."
