 I do get the correct python banner (I believe), but also the above warning and was wondering if this is an issue.

  I put a screenshot of both the original error message and of the command prompt before I run the python command.
 </p>
 <p>
  For reference, I have used and installed python before, but I uninstalled and reinstalled using your directions.

   Interesting!  What happens if, at the command prompt, you enter

   Get-Command python

     Do you recall ever  typing a command something like "conda" when you did the previous installs of python?

      Hi Professor, I have the same exact issue here.  All the given screenshots also match my PowerShell.  Over winter break, I installed Python 3.7.6 via Professor Walker White's instructions for CS 1110 for the fall 2020 semester, and it also gave me the same error.  I don't remember typing "conda" anywhere though.
     </p>

        Since it is midnight in Ithaca, let me post a direct short answer as the "answer", and leave my curiosity-driven investigations for the next day or two.  Thank you all for the info!

         Hello! So I used the instructions posted on the website -- I don't know if they were the fall instructions or have been updated for the spring semester. As for previous installations of python, I may very well have typed something like "conda." I was self-learning some python and the installation had many issues that I tried to fix myself or through googling, so I could have easily typed some other things during that.

          May I use your screenshot, with attribution to you, in an update our testing instructions webpage to reassure students about this message?

           Yes you may use it, could you get rid of my name on the screenshot? Just blur over it or something similar? Thank you!

            Strangely, I meant to say I would redact your username in the screenshot, but appear to have deleted that part of my request.

   Can you provide a screenshot of your PowerShell window that shows your command prompt
   <i>
    before
   </i>
   you run the python command?
   <break>
   </break>
   <break>
   </break>
   What I'm particularly curious about is whether there's something in parentheses before your command prompt.
   <break>
   </break>
   <break>
   </break>
   That is, your command prompt could look like this, with something in parentheses at the beginning, like this:
   <break>
   </break>
   <break>
   </break>
   (env) C:\Users\yourname&gt;
  </p>
  <p>
   or doesn't have that parentheses, like this:
   <break>
   </break>
  </p>
  <p>
   C:\Users\yourname&gt;
   <break>
   </break>
  </p>
  <p>
   My guess is that you'll see the parentheses (which give the name of something called a "virtual environment"), but I want to verify this first before proceeding.
  </p>

    Hi Professor, just for quick information, I have the exact same issue, all screenshots match, but I haven't installed Python before.

  Short answer: for the purposes of CS1110 you can ignore that warning!
 </p>
 <p>
  But it is
  <i>
   always
  </i>
  good to check in about warnings, since it can be very difficult for someone starting out (or even sometimes those of us who have been around the block a few times) to know what is ignorable and what could lead to major problems...
