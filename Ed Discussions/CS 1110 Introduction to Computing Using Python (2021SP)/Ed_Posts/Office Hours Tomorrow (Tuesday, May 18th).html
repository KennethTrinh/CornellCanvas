 Hello, everyone! I am sorry if this question is posted/answered somewhere else, but I was wondering about office hours tomorrow. I know the professors said that they would hold office hours this week, but will the time only be from 10-11 (like we do after class) or will there also be open office hours during what would have been "class time"? Thank you!
</p>
