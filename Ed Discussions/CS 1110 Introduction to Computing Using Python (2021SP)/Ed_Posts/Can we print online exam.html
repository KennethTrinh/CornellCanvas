  I am terrified of having to take an exam on a blank sheet of paper as opposed to a normal, well-designed exam structure. I think it will negatively impact my score, and I am not sure from the lecture if we are allowed to print the online exam? Thanks!

  Prof. Fan and I have consulted, and because not all online students will have access to a printer, we will disallow printing of the exam.

  Please do look through the archive of previous exams to familiarize yourself with the usual formatting of CS1110 prelims.

  What about for questions that reference a diagram or code? For example, in one year they had definitions for a diagram with labels on the diagram. Do we have to redraw everything? What about rewriting the preconditions and the function definition given in the question?

  1. For questions of that style, you would have to write down the labels and corresponding numbers, but you wouldn't have to re-draw the diagram itself.

  2. No, you would not need to rewrite function docstrings.

  A somewhat related question: Would I be able to scan my papers via a scanner/printer that is connected to my computer?
