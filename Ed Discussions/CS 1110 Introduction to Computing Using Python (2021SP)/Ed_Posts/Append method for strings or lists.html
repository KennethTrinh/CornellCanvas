 The post sent yesterday talked about what we are expected to know about the methods and functions. It says we should know the "append method for strings". Isn't the append method only applies to lists?

  Sorry, that was a typo -- should have said "append method for lists".

   x = ["hi"]
x.append("there")
print(x)

s = "hi"
s.append("there") # this causes an error
