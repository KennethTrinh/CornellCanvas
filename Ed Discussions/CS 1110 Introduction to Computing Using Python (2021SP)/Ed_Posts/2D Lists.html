 From my understanding, lecture 12 is covered on the prelim (except dictionaries). But are 2D lists on the exam? I did the spring prelims from the past but did not see any 2D lists.

  These are fair game.

  Really, 2-d lists are just lists of things, albeit where those things are themselves lists!  So I myself don't really think of them as being a separate topic.

  You can think of those questions where there are objects that contain lists of objects as being a form of 2-d lists, if you are looking for practice questions.
