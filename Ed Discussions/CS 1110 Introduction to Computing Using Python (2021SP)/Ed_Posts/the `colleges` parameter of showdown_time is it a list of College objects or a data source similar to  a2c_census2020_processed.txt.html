  The docstring for showdown_time says that the parameter
  <code>
   colleges
  </code>
  is a "data source", but the code (that was given to us) in showdown_time calls the college_named function using
  <code>
   colleges
  </code>
  as the
  <code>
   clist
  </code>
  parameter, which indicates that
  <code>
   colleges
  </code>
  is a list of College objects? Could you clarify what exactly
  <code>
   colleges
  </code>
  is?

  A list of colleges
  <italic>
   is
  </italic>
  the source of data for
  <code>
   showdown_time()
  </code>
  for it to compute what it needs to. That's what we meant by the description of the parameter, but we should have been more clear. Thanks for asking; it was a good question!
