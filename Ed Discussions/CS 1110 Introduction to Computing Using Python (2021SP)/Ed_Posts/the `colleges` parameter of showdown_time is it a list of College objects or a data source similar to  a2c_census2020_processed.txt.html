 The docstring for showdown_time says that the parameter
 <code>
  colleges
 </code>
 is a "data source", but the code (that was given to us) in showdown_time calls the college_named function using
 <code>
  colleges
 </code>
 as the
 <code>
  clist
 </code>
 parameter, which indicates that
 <code>
  colleges
 </code>
 is a list of College objects? Could you clarify what exactly
 <code>
  colleges
 </code>
 is?

  A list of colleges
  <i>
   is
  </i>
  the source of data for
  <code>
   showdown_time()
  </code>
  for it to compute what it needs to. That's what we meant by the description of the parameter, but we should have been more clear. Thanks for asking; it was a good question!
