  In the 4th call frame there is the parameter is_female and True is assigned to it. I don't understand where the True came from. Is it from line 9? If so, I'm confused how if is_female: would evaluate to anything because it's not being operated/compared to anything. I originally thought it would just store is_female as the parameter is_female. Can I get a breakdown of what happens in the execution of this call frame?

  You know, when you asked your question, I looked and also panicked, "Where is is_female coming from?".  So, happens to the best of us!  (Or at least also to me.)
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  First, by "4th" do you mean "1st", by any chance? Or did you mean "3rd".  The stack is going from top to bottom, so the frame for
  <code>
   song()
  </code>
  is the first one that is created, and that one has an
  <code>
   is_female
  </code>
  parameter.  So does the third one.  But the 4th one, for function
  <code>
   she()
  </code>
  , doesn't have an
  <code>
   is_female
  </code>
  parameter (variable) in it.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  <bold>
   One explanation
  </bold>
  <break>
  </break>
  Line 25 takes the value
  <code>
   True
  </code>
  and hands it to
  <code>
   song()
  </code>
  as input ...
  <break>
  </break>
  ----&gt; which
  <code>
   song()
  </code>
  stores in its parameter, which is named
  <code>
   is_female
  </code>
  .
  <break>
  </break>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Line 21, when we get to it, hands the value of
  <code>
   is_female
  </code>
  --- which is
  <code>
   True
  </code>
  , from what we just said --- to
  <code>
   live_long()
  </code>
  as input ...
  <break>
  </break>
  ---&gt; which
  <code>
   live_long()
  </code>
  stores in its parameter, which happens to also be named
  <code>
   is_female
  </code>
  .
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  So that's why all the
  <code>
   live_long()
  </code>
  frames have the
  <code>
   is_female
  </code>
  parameter set to
  <code>
   True
  </code>
  .

   Another explanation
  </bold>
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  What is happening when Python sees the code 1-25 is:
  <break>
  </break>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  It reads all the function definitions in lines 1-23, nods its head sagely and says, "I got it", but doesn't actually do anything but remember those definitions.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  The first time it executes any line is when it gets to line 25.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  The execution of the call
  <code>
   song(True)
  </code>
  sends the value
  <code>
   True
  </code>
  as input to the function
  <code>
   song()
  </code>
  , which stores the value
  <code>
   True
  </code>
  into its parameter, named
  <code>
   is_female
  </code>
  .  So the
  <code>
   is_female
  </code>
  in the frame for
  <code>
   song()
  </code>
  has value
  <code>
   True
  </code>
  .
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  Executing line 21 in
  <code>
   song()
  </code>
  involves a call that looks like
  <code>
   &lt;some function&gt;(is_female)
  </code>
  .  Whatever "some function" is, Python first figures out the value of its argument.  In this case,
  <code>
   is_female
  </code>
  (in the frame for
  <code>
   song
  </code>
  ) is
  <code>
   True
  </code>
  .  So, whatever "some function" is, it takes the value
  <code>
   True
  </code>
  as input and stashes this value in its parameter variable.  In this case, "some function" is
  <code>
   live_long()
  </code>
  and the parameter for
  <code>
   live_long()
  </code>
  is called
  <code>
   is_female
  </code>
  . That
  <code>
   is_female
  </code>
  is the one you highlighted in the second
  <code>
   live_long()
  </code>
  frame.
