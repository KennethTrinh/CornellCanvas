  In the lecture on Thursday, Professor Lee mentioned that when importing a script on the command line (like the one below), it will only show something on the screen when a print statement is used inside the Script. Is this also true of a Return statement (e.g if a return function is written in a Script, will it show something on the command line when you run the script on the command line)?

  No. You would have to wrap the function call (which calls the function with the return statement) with print() if you would want it to show up in the command line.
