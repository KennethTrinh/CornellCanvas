 Hello, everyone! On the page for Assignment 6, it talks about how we are allowed to add helper functions and classes. Does this also mean we can add helper methods? For example, if we make a new class, we will most likely need an __init__ method, but can we add more helper methods (inside our new classes) as we see fit? Thank you!
