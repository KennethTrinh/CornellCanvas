  What are the best ways to practice class and subclasses problems? Did you guys find any exams or practice problems that are representative of what we will need to know?

  Hi, the study guide does tell you about problems you should skip as not right for this semester, for each of the previous exams.

  You do have testing code for the Spring 2018 class/subclass problem about writing a  (non-method) function that deals with classes and subclasses.

  If you want testing code for other problems, you should be able to write your own, modeling it after a6_in_action.py --- add str() and repr() for the new classes/subclasses,  create objects of a given class you had to write, and print out their values to see if they are right.

  You should definitely also be completely solid on our prelim 2's class question.
