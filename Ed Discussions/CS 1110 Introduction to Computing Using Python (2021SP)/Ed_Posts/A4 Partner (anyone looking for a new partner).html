  Hey guys, my partner dropped the class after the prelim so now for A4 and the rest of the semester I am partner-less, so I was wondering if anyone may still be looking for a partner or have found themselves in a similar situation. If you're looking for a partner as well, send me an email (bjr226@cornell.edu)! I'm on campus and would love to be able to meet up together to work on assignments and any other material in the class while we're at it!
