 Can global variables be changed?  I remember in a prelecture video Prof. White said to not change global variables, but I could have misinterpreted.  I am asking this in the context of A2, for example, when book1 is assigned ic.

  Global variables can be changed - you cross them out as demonstrated before. I believe the video you might be referencing might be talking about global variables in the context of a call frame, in which local variables are changed, not global variables (and where he did mention that there is a way to edit global variables, but that it's poor code to do so)
