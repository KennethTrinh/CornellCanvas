  Hi, all! I just had a question about spaces vs tabs when writing code. According to the text for Assignment 1, we should use spaces and not tabs to indent. Is that for everywhere (including comments, etc.) or just in lines of code. Also, when we define a function or write below the given Docstrings in the given functions, the default text is already indented. Is this indent done with spaces or with tabs? Do we need to fix it? Thank you!

  Everything should be indented by spaces!

  About your second question: the already indented text is indented properly, so no need to worry about that.
