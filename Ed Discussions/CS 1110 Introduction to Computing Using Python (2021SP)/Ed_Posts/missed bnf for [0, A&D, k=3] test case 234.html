  Got through the first 233 test cases, but our code crashed at the 234th (A and D at post 0 for k=3) with a missed bnf. Is there something special about this case? a lot of other k=3 cases passed before this one

  Something that jumps out at me is that, at node 0.1 (written by D), there are

   two

  replies authored by A.

  The first one, 0.1.1, is not part of a k=3 bnf for A&amp;D starting at 0. (Because it's part of a longer one.)
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  But the second one, 0.1.2, is.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  So one hypothesis is that your code get over-confident about the answer when it sees 0.1.1, and perhaps is never checking whether 0.1.2 could be part of the at-0 A&amp;D k=3 bnf.
