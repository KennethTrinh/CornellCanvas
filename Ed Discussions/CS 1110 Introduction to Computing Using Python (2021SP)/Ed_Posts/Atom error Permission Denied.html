  Hi, I can think of two (related) reasons this might be happening:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1. Are you drag-and-dropping the script onto the command shell?
  <break>
  </break>
  If so, you need to have the word "python" first on the command shell, do
  <italic>
   not
  </italic>
  hit return, but leave a space, and then do the drag-and-drop.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  2. Are you typing just the file name into the command shell, rather than "python &lt;filename&gt;" ?

  Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

  I'm sorry, I'm just struggling to understand what we should be plugging in and would appreciate any assistance I can get. Thank you.

  You’re using two different kind of quotation marks for the string and Python doesn’t like that, try ‘ab cd’ or “ab cd”
