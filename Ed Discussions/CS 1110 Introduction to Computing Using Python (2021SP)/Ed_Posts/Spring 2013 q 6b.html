 Put in your question title the year, semester, and question.  Ideal would also be to include the topic.   Example: 2018SP Q2(b) - call frames
</callout>
<callout type="info">
 Include a screenshot of the question, so readers/answerers don't have to go find the relevant pdf
</callout>
<p>
 Does this answer (specifically the for loop and conditional) work for this question? I can't check it using atom because I don't have a file with the object.

  What about mname's length being 0?
 </p>
 <p>
  Every time you execute the else statement, you are appending a new LastUsed, which you should definitely not be doing! You should be appending a LastUsed with inits to all_last only once if it is not in the list, but you will be appending every time you are checking an item in all_last whose item.prefix is not equal to inits!
 </p>
 <p>
  Highly recomend using the ind function given in question 5.
