 Follow up question on an earlier one about else statements: suppose an "if" statement is not fulfilled (i.e. evaluates to false), therefore skipping to the "else statement". For visualization purposes, do we need to write down and then cross out the line number of the "else statement" in the instruction counter or do we not write anything for it?
</p>
<p>
 example:
</p>
<p>
 (1) if 1&lt;0:
</p>
<p>
 (2) ...
</p>
<p>
 (3) return x
</p>
<p>
 (4) else:
</p>
<p>
 (5) return y
</p>
<p>
 Would the instruction counter be just 5, or 4 and 5?
</p>

  Hi! The instructions say that "else" statements should be treated as executable (and [sometimes] executed) executed statements, just like any other line that might or might not be executed.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  See the archived 2018 Spring A2 assignment and solution for a worked example with an if-else statement.   For your specific question, I can't tell what the indentation of line 3 is.  Assuming it is indented, then the program/instruction counter would be 1, 4, 5, crossed out as appropriate.  If line 3 isn't indented, then the counter would be 1, 3, crossed out as appropriate.)

   Thank you! Sorry about the indentation - it seemed to have undone the indentation when I wrote the question haha!

    Yeah, I'm still getting used to the formatting possibilities in Ed Discussion, too.  You can use the "&lt;&gt;" button to make a text block for code in which indentation gets preserved:
    <break>
    </break>
   </p>
   <pre># I
    # can
        # keep
            # indenting
    </pre>
