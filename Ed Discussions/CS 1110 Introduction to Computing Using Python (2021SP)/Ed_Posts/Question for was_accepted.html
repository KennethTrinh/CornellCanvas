  Hi! I am working on was_accepted and got the error below:
 </paragraph>
 <pre>Starting the tests in this module.
Starting test_was_accepted
        Testing with small_test1.txt
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "helper_tests.py", line 209, in &lt;module&gt;
    test_was_accepted()
  File "helper_tests.py", line 77, in test_was_accepted
    colleges = sdu.colleges_from_file(fname)
  File "C:\Users\jennywong\desktop\cshw3\sd_utilities.py", line 43, in colleges_from_file
    with open(os.path.join(DATADIR,fn), "r") as fp:
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'data\\small_test1.txt'</pre>
 <paragraph>
  For my code in was_accepted, I used 4 'if' conditions to see where tag is in. I do not understand what this error message means.

  Thank you so much!

  I'm not sure if this is correct but the error appears to deal with your files as opposed to your actual code. I suggest you make sure your small_test1.txt is in the same directory as the rest of your files. If it is, then check to make sure that it is the same name as what the specific file the computer is looking for.
