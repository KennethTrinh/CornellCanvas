 My test for was_accepted is not working. It's telling me that it expected True but got False. I don't know why. I made "if" statements for each of the 4 object attributes (waitlisted, rejected, and both of the "accepted" ones). If it was equal to an accepted one, I made the function return true. I'm not sure what else to do.

  Hi!  Debugging is like detective work; your job is to find and interpret the clues.

  First, you should check exactly which test case is failing: use the error/printed-out messages to track down which case is failing. Make sure you understand what the answer

   should
  </i>
  be for that case.

  </break>

  </break>
  Then, for debugging:  put print statements inside each of your if statements to see which of them are "activated" (which ones are executed).
