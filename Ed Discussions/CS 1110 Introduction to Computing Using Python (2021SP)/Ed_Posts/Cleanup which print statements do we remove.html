  I was just doing the code cleanup for assignment 1 and saw it said delete all print statements. Is that for both a1_first and a1_second or is that just referring to any print statements I may have added to a1_second?

  Instead of deleting them, canâ€™t we just comment them out ?
  <break>
  </break>
  Or they should be strictly deleted ?

  Delete every single one in a1_second!

 <paragraph>
  Also, if you put in any print statements in a1_first that were for debugging your tests, you should delete those too (don't delete the ones provided for you!)

  So delete all of the print statements that were already there? Or just delete ones that I may have added?
