  When I run my code identically to the example, I get the same percentages for each one. But the example has far, far fewer student ids listed.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Was this cut short just for brevity reasons (and the real response IS long), or am I missing something?

  Thank you

  Sorry, i don't quite understand.  Do you have repeated student tags in your listings, for example, which make your lists of students longer?

  My internal data (lists of students for the out object) is exactly like the example in the assignment 3 pdf, but when I actually run the script, it prints out Rejected: and then like five hundred unique IDs. Is this supposed to happen? Is it just because the 3rd data set is so large?

  It seems like at some point your code is printing out a
  <bold>
   College
  </bold>
  (which would include who was rejected and stuff) when it should be printing a College's
  <bold>
   name
  </bold>
  (which would just be a string like "Cornell_U").
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  Be careful to distinguish between these two!
