  I was just wondering since the drop deadline has been extended, has the S/U deadline been extended as well? The reason for asking is since the drop deadline is more of a serious decision, it would make sense for the S/U deadline to be extended as well.

  Hi, instructors have no control over a student's grade option.  You would need to petition your college's registar for that.  Check your college registrar's webpage for the process.

  Do be warned that different colleges seems to have different policies about the grade change.  We've seen some students' petitions pass, but others be denied.
