 I'm currently in quarantine and I can't go to my in person discussion tomorrow. I should probably tell them that I'm not going right so I know of any work to make up?

  There should be an announcement coming in about an hour from Prof. Fan about the first section if you will miss it!

  But if you'd like to get a jump start on introducing yourself, on the course homepage,
  <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs1110/2021sp/">
   https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs1110/2021sp/
  </a>
  , Semester info item 6 ("Info unlikely to change during the semester") subitem 3 "Lecture and lab times, location, and lead instructions" is where you'll want to go to find out who your lab lead is!
