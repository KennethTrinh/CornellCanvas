  But if you'd like to get a jump start on introducing yourself, on the course homepage,
  <link href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs1110/2021sp/"/>
  https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs1110/2021sp/, Semester info item 6 ("Info unlikely to change during the semester") subitem 3 "Lecture and lab times, location, and lead instructions" is where you'll want to go to find out who your lab lead is!
