 Why would you use one and not the other when you're making a module?

 Thanks for the help :)

  You are able to “print” the documentation of your Python program, and the docstring at the beginning will appear describing the program, and docstrings for functions/methods will describe those functions/methods.

  </break>
  Making comments throughout your code should make the program more readable in terms of how specific parts of your code do specific things. Someone reading the documentation does not need to know the specifics of your program (e.g. why you’re using an array instead of a string inside one of your functions), while someone reading the actual source code might need to.

  Basically, it has zero effect on the actual execution of your program, but it makes your program much more readable for anyone looking at the source code or documentation.
