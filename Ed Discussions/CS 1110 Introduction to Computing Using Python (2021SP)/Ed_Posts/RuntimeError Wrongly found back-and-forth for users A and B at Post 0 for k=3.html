  For this one, we went through our 3 base cases and have a recursive call afterwards. We aren't able to exactly figure out what the error message means.

  -- wrongly found means either:
  <break>
  </break>
  (a) your code is saying there's a back and forth when there isn't --- not applicable here because there
  <bold>
   is
  </bold>
  a k=3 A&amp;B bnf at 0, or
  <break>
  </break>
  (b) it's true that there is such a bnf, but your code is returning the wrong thing --- wrong length, wrong types of items in the list, not a list at all, something like that.
