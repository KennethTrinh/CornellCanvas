  Since k=1, and 7.1.1 on the assignment sheet says the base case should be k = 1, my current code is returning False because there shouldn't be a back and forth occurring. However, I'm getting this error:

 <paragraph>
  "RuntimeError: Missed back-and-forth for users A and B at Post 0010 for k=1"
 </paragraph>

  From what I interpret about the function, 0010 should not have a back and forth.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Any idea why this is happening?
