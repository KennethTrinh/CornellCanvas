  Put in your question title the year, semester, and question.  Ideal would also be to include the topic.   Example: 2018SP Q2(b) - call frames
 </callout>
 <callout type="info">
  Include a screenshot of the question, so readers/answerers don't have to go find the relevant pdf.

  Hi! Regarding the first call frame's line counter: I thought that since the "if" statement in line 8 is already fulfilled, then the "else" statement in line 11 will not be executed and should not show up in the counter (according to this post
  <link href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/3933/discussion/316572"/>
  https://edstem.org/us/courses/3933/discussion/316572). So for this solution, why is line 11 included in the counter?

  Editing the prelim 1 study guide to mention this ... after having just checked the Spring 2020 grading guide to make sure we didn't misgrade everyone that semester ... and it looks like by the time we graded, we had caught this mistake.
