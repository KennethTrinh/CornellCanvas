  If a function asks us to fill out the body of a function and gives:
 </paragraph>
 <list style="ordered">
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    def check_grade(original, doctored, i):
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
 </list>
 <paragraph>
  Can we just write on our blank paper just the body that goes underneath it, or do we have to write out the
  <code>
   def check_grade(original, doctored, i):
  </code>
  on top in order to show proper indentation?

  (Writing it out is normally not a problem, but sometimes the function names are long and I would just like to save time during the exam if I can)

  OK to write, literally, with the "...", as below; but having the function name in will help us know which problem you're doing, and we do need to see the indentation.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  def check_grade ...(rest of header)...:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  or
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  def check_grade ..... :
 </paragraph>
