 Hi, saw this question in the queuemein queue.
 <break>
 </break>
 <break>
 </break>
 The testing code that generates that message is this:
 <break>
 </break>
 <break>
 </break>
</p>
<pre>    # Check that one can't add a redundant course (== course with same name, 
    # even if time is different)
    redundant = Course("FAKER 0000 LEC 002", "M 3:00pm-4:00pm")
    roster.add(redundant)
    assert redundant not in roster.courses.values(), \
        "add method allowed addition of redundant course"</pre>
<p>
 So, what the message means is that there was already a course in the Schedule called
 <code>
  roster
 </code>
 with the name "Faker 0000 LEC 002", and your
 <code>
  add()
 </code>
 method should have checked for that and not allowed the new course
 <code>
  redundant
 </code>
 with the same name to be added to the Schedule.
</p>
