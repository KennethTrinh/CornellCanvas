  Hi, saw this question in the queuemein queue.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  The testing code that generates that message is this:
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
 </paragraph>
 <pre>    # Check that one can't add a redundant course (== course with same name, 
    # even if time is different)
    redundant = Course("FAKER 0000 LEC 002", "M 3:00pm-4:00pm")
    roster.add(redundant)
    assert redundant not in roster.courses.values(), \
        "add method allowed addition of redundant course"</pre>
 <paragraph>
  So, what the message means is that there was already a course in the Schedule called
  <code>
   roster
  </code>
  with the name "Faker 0000 LEC 002", and your
  <code>
   add()
  </code>
  method should have checked for that and not allowed the new course
  <code>
   redundant
  </code>
  with the same name to be added to the Schedule.
