 ENDORSED
</h3>
<p>
 Hi all!
</p>
<p>
 I was thinking about real-life implications of the code when I realize that my method for determining whether a class conflicts may not work if the class is overnight (i.e. the end time could be considered to be before the start time) - yes, there are
 <a href="https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/SP21/class/PE/1616">
  overnight classes at Cornell
 </a>
 :). When thinking about how to resolve this, I realized that the requested format for the time also doesn't really account for this. Should we be considering this case? Thanks!
</p>

  Good question! Definitely a niche case.

 <p>
  If you look at the site, you can see that the class dates are broken up over two days:

  Since overnight courses are the tiny, tiny minority of courses offered at Cornell, I don't think an implementation of courses really needs to worry about this -- you

  don't need to worry about it in your code for this assignment. Good on you for asking, though!

   I confirm that you don't need to worry about overnight classes for this assignment.  And I also very pleased that you are thinking about the real-life implementation of this assignment!

   ... and you can also see that the registrar had to treat these as a special case, as well!

    We also didn't include Sat or Sun courses, mostly just because I didn't have the energy to look up the code for "Sunday".  Is it U?  N?

     Sunday is given as Su in the course roster in case you're interested, which would probably require more code to check, given that it's a two-letter string, though you could probably do it based on the case of the letter. Tempted to put in the preconditions of the code "Assumes roster only includes classes at reasonable times" :)

      I think you could use tuples for that situation because it is two letters
