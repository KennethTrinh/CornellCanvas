 I still don't understand when to use something like self.method() vs method(self), could someone please explain this to me?

  Hi!

  We think of methods (or, technically, "instance methods" as we have introduced in class) as associated with a "calling object", so self.method() would always be preferred.

   Hi, but on Lab 15 there was this comment as well: "The leading underscore "_" in the name indicates that it's intended to be a private function. You may wish to ponder whether it's better for
   <code>
    _score
   </code>
   to be a method or a non-method function."
  </p>
  <p>
   Does this indicate that the _ for __ init __ or __ str __ are exceptions to this preference?
  </p>
  <p>
   Thank you!
  </p>

    Good question!  This is a bit complicated, and there are various ways to answer it.
    <break>

    (a) I think for the purposes of CS1110, maybe the best way to think of this is that indeed, double-underscore methods are exceptions to the usual convention/preference. [footnote 1]
    <break>
    </break>
    <break>
    </break>
    (b) What was said about "_score" was actually on a different topic.  "_score(...)" has only a single underscore in front of it, actually [footnote 2]. The note was meant to indicate: you can think about whether to leave _score(...) as is, or to redefine it as method with name score(...) (with no underscore).
    <break>
    </break>
    <break>
    </break>
    [footnote 1: special, or double-underscore methods, are even processed differently by Python, in that they work on the class, not the object level, for Reasons.  If you are interested, see
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-lookup">
     https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-lookup
     but please don't feel that you should be able to understand what that document is talking about --- especially since CS1110 is an intro to
     <i>
      programming
     </i>
     , not to the particularities of Python per se.  (alliteration, hurrah)]
     <break>
     </break>
     <break>
     </break>
     [If you're typographically inclined, you may find the different uses of underscores in Python semi-interesting.  See this part of the Python style guide:
     <link href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#id36"/>
