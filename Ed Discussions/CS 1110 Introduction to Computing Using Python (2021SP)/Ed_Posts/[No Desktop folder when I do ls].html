  Hello,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I was looking through the labs and tried to run the first exercise with moving the folder lab03 to Desktop and running it. However, when I typed ls, there was no desktop (I double checked and got an error message when I tried to type "cd Desktop"). Is there any reason why my desktop would not be in my list directory and how could I change that?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thanks!

  If you don't mind removing your Desktop from the OneDrive folder (in which case, it would stop being backed up), follow the instructions of
  <link href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/23504-restore-default-location-personal-folders-windows-10-a.html#option2s4"/>
  the first method here.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  If you would like to keep your Desktop folder backed up on your OneDrive folder, while still having that same folder appear in "its normal location," follow the following advice from Professor Lee (and found in Lab 3 activity 1):
 </paragraph>
 <pre>If you don't see "Desktop" in the ls output, your computer might have the Desktop folder
inside your OneDrive folder. (Check by entering ls OneDrive. If "Desktop" doesn't show 
up there, get help from a staff member.) Our recommended workaround is to create a 
"portal" from the Desktop in OneDrive to your home directory (this should allow 
OneDrive to still back up your Desktop). While in your home directory, enter 
New-Item -Name Desktop -ItemType Junction -Value OneDrive\Desktop
Now when you do ls, Desktop should be there, and you can continue with this lab!

  In addition to what consultant Dylan asks, I realize that what you've reported is bringing up vague memories from last year of an interaction with OneDrive.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  OP (original poster): If you do "ls OneDrive" (the uppercase version would be "LS ONEDRIVE", so you can see what letters I'm talking about), does a Desktop folder show up in the listing of the contents of OneDrive?

  Seems like your Desktop folder is missing. Could you try

  OP, are you depending on OneDrive for backups, or did your computer come with the OneDrive folder already on it, do you happen to know?

  Sorry just seeing this! I was using OneDrive, that was the problem. My Desktop was only in OneDrive for some reason so I changed that. Thank you!

  OK, here's my second reply!

  Consultant Dylan's solution "the first method here"  that moves the Desktop folder out of OneDrive and into their "normal" locations, made a lot of sense!  So if that works fine for you, that's great, and thanks again,

  Another option,
  <italic>
   if
  </italic>
  you want to keep the Desktop folder  backed up by OneDrive, is given in the newly-added "sidenote d" in Lab 3 Activity 1. OP, if you wanted to go with this option,
  <bold>
   first
  </bold>
  move the Desktop folder
  <italic>
   back into OneDrive
  </italic>
  , so that everything is as it was before you asked this question.
  <bold>
   Then (second)

  :

  Good Afternoon,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I just wanted to follow up with this issue. During lab today, I tried running this portal command, but I got this error message:

  Ah: I think the lab webpage html is lying to you about what the punctuation marks are!  (My fault; I was going some trickery to get things to display nicely).
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  Can you try copy-pasting the following into your command shell?  (Looks the same, as what's on the webpage, but copy-pastes differently!)
  <break>
  </break>
 </paragraph>
 <pre>New-Item -Name Desktop -ItemType Junction -Value OneDrive\Desktop

  Ah - let's think about this.  If you
  <italic>
   want
  </italic>
  to use OneDrive for backup, we may not want to take your Desktop (and other important folders) out of the OneDrive folder.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  Go ahead with the lab for now; behind the scenes, we'll figure out some general advice.
