  Hi! Initially when running a test for bnf_starts_here, I received the following error message:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  RuntimeError: Missed back-and-forth for users A and B at Post 0010 for k=1
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  After changing my code, I then received this error message:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  RuntimeError: Wrongly found back-and-forth for users A and B at Post 0010 for k=1
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  These messages seem to contradict each other with regard to what happens at Post 0010, but I imagine I am simply interpreting them wrong. Could you please explain what the errors are saying?

  Thank you!!
