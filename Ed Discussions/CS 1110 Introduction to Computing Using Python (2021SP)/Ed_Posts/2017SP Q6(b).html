 Put in your question title the year, semester, and question.  Ideal would also be to include the topic.   Example: 2018SP Q2(b) - call frames
</callout>
<callout type="info">
 Include a screenshot of the question, so readers/answerers don't have to go find the relevant pdf.

 I am confused why "a" is stored in v. Is it because v loops through those vowels and holds a first?

  Yes, the first value that
  <code>
   v
  </code>
  takes on is
  <code>
   "a".
  </code>
  But also, note that whichever branch of the if/else statement is entered, the function returns without ever allowing the loop to go through its second iteration.  That is, the loop is exiting too early!

  Try it out in python tutor or python to see.
