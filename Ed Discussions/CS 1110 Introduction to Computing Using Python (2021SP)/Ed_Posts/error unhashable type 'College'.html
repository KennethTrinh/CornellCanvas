 While working on the dictionary versions of process_line and college_named, we've been getting these errors on parts of the code that we haven't been working on.
</p>
<p>
 Why are our implementations affecting these pre-written parts of the code, and what can we do to solve this problem?

  Hey!!
  <break>
  </break>
  Only hashable objects such as strings, tuples, and integers can be used as keys for dictionaries. It seems like c.name is returning a college object, and not a hashable object?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Hope this helps :))
