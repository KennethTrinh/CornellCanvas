 I noticed that there hasn't been a new seating assignment released on CMSX for me, and I was wondering if it just hasn't been released in general or if this could be a more individualized problem.

 Thanks!

  Tentatively: I believe there was no new seating arrangement for this week, since add/drop passed. (Except that there was one student who swapped into an in-person section).

  If you had a seat assignment before, just use the previous one; if not, could you contact cs1110-prof@cornell.edu?

   Prof. Fan says, "Last week's seat announcement said that we'd keep the same seats for "several weeks.""
