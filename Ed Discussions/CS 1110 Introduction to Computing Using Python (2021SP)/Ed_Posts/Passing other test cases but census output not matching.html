 My code works for the other 2 test cases but for the census one, it keeps getting a massive output:

 FYI, here is the internal showdown data Cornell_U vs. Harvard_U accepted at both: 67,83,106,124,157,182,231,242,273,275,276,297,413,425,438,450,500,501,663,666,723,740,755,760,769,794,845,846,887,957,988,1004,1104,1112,1208,1273,1318,1403,1420,1450,1465,1505,1512,1516,1536,1587,1588,1629,1639,1651,1666,1685,1700,1802,1824,1831,1861,1866,1871,1889,1903,1931,1932,2015,2020,2056,2063,2120,2125,2134,2404,2430,2461,2509,2512,2513,2567,2750,2814,2826,2856,2882,2938,2950,2955,2996,3016,383,404,453,548,888,1464,1731,1896,1902,1952,2665 accepted at both, enrolled at Cornell_U: 67,83,106,124,157,182,231,242,273,275,276,297,413,425,438,450,500,501,663,666,723,740,755,760,769,794,845,846,887,957,988,1004,1104,1112,1208,1273,1318,1403,1420,1450,1465,1505,1512,1516,1536,1587,1588,1629,1639,1651,1666,1685,1700,1802,1824,1831,1861,1866,1871,1889,1903,1931,1932,2015,2020,2056,2063,2120,2125,2134,2404,2430,2461,2509,2512,2513,2567,2750,2814,2826,2856,2882,2938,2950,2955,2996,3016 accepted at both, enrolled at Harvard_U: 383,404,453,548,888,1731,1902,1952,2665

  If you look at the census data file, student 740 was accepted at Cornell and not Harvard
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  740 &gt;&gt; Boston_U : Accepted ## Carnegie_Mellon_U : Accepted ## Claremont_McKenna_College : Rejected ## Cornell_U : Accepted ## Dartmouth_College : Accepted ## Emory_U : Accepted ## Georgetown_U : Accepted ## Harvard_U : Rejected ## Indiana_U-Bloomington : Accepted ## Northwestern_U : Accepted ## Princeton_U : Rejected ## UIllinois_at_Urbana-Champaign : Rejected ## UPennsylvania : Rejected ## Vanderbilt_U : Accepted ## Washington_U_in_St._Louis : Wait-listed ## Yale_U : Rejected ## enr : Cornell_U
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  but student 740 is appearing in your "accepted at both" printout. Your
  <code>
   showdown_time
  </code>
  function must be building the list incorrectly - make sure that
  <code>
   accepted_at_both
  </code>
  contains only students accepted at both schools.
