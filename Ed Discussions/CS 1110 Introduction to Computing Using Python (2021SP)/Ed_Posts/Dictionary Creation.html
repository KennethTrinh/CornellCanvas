  Hello!
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <break>
  </break>
  I am trying to code process_line(sline, cdict) in sd_utilities_dict.py but I'm hitting some uh dead ends in my though process.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For example, process_line requires us to "Add the tag of sline to the appropriate list (accepted_enrolled, ..., or waitlist)"
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  however, sline is only broken up so that senrolled_cn is given. In this case would I need to code something to find swaitlist (college(s) that the student is waitlisted in?). And do the same for saccepted(list of colleges student is accepted in?)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Another thing I am unsure of is the case where "sline names a college not already represented in cdict, a corresponding College is added to cdict."
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I would assume that I need to make a new value in cdict, but I don't know how I would assign it to a "corresponding" College. Where is the college coming from? Does it need to be instantiated?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thank you!

  Hey!! So, because sline is broken up for you already, you do not have to do anything with the sline variable.  You do not need to create a dictionary, as the second parameter for the function is a dictionary.  What you need to do is append the tag to the proper attribute of each college object in cdict.  So, in the body of the for loop provided, you need to access the college object of each outcome and append the tag to the proper college object attribute.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For example, cdict["cornell_u"] returns the college object associated with Cornell University, which you can access the attributes of. In the for loop provided, each outcome has a college name, which is scname.  So think about how to code the function with this information.

  -Hope this helps!! :)

  Each outcome has a college name and decision for that college.  scname is the variable for the college name, and the decision variable (which is either “Rejected”, “Wait-listed”, or “Accepted” [these are strings, by the way]) is the decision associated with that college.

  Okay, thank you very much! I would like to check - if my code has an error " m = sdu.menu_listing(colleges)" does it mean I have completed process_line?

  I’m not sure, why don’t you try fixing menu_listing first to see if process_line completely works.

  I was testing showdown on 2 and 3 and panicked because I started getting lots of print statements (I made the program print every time a tag was appended) and I was like ;-; what's going on I don't even have a while loop why is it behaving like a indefinite while loop BUT I realized it just because there's more colleges in 2/3 than in 1 so it'd print more statements!
