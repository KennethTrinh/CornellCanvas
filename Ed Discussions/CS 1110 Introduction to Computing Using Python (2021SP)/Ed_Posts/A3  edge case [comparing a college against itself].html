 Should our code work for comparing a college to itself (i.e. should we care if the result doesn't make any sense)?

  I take it back! Your code should not
  <i>
   crash
  </i>
  on this case, but you are right --- I had only one interpretation in mind, and you bring up others.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  So, I now solemnly swear: for the case of a college being compared against itself, we will not test what your code does for that case.

   Good question!

   Scratch this: [Yes, it should work, since the function specification didn't rule this case out. (Can you thus guess what one of the test cases our autograder will used might be ...?)]

   See next answer instead!!!!

    What result should we be looking for then? Do we want them both to have 100% or 0% or one 100 and the other 0 or maybe both 50%? It isn't terribly clear from the prompt "% who chose X over X:". We also don't have much latitude in how the answers are calculated or printed, so getting whatever value we are looking for could be a little convoluted.
