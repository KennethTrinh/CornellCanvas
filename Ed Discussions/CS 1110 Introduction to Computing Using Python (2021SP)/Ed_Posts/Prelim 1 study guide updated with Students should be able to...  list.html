  We just discovered that Spring 2020 Head Consultant Ariel Kellison had provided a "students should be able to" list for prelim 1 that semester.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  Since some of you may find it handy, it's been added to the posted Prelim 1 Study Guide (available from the course schedule webpage and the page with the archived exams.)

  <break>
  </break>
  Here is that list.
  <bold>
   Being able to do the assignments and labs ensures that you will have achieved all these learning goals
  </bold>
  <italic>
   ; so focus on doing practice problems
  </italic>
  when studying, rather than going methodically through the list below. I am presenting this list mostly to  show you everything that you have already learned at this point in the class; congratulations, you!!
