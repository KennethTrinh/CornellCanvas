 We just discovered that Spring 2020 Head Consultant Ariel Kellison had provided a "students should be able to" list for prelim 1 that semester.
 <break>
 </break>
 <break>
 </break>
 Since some of you may find it handy, it's been added to the posted Prelim 1 Study Guide (available from the course schedule webpage and the page with the archived exams.)
 <break>
 </break>
 <break>
 </break>
 Here is that list.
 <b>
  Being able to do the assignments and labs ensures that you will have achieved all these learning goals
 </b>
 <i>
  ; so focus on doing practice problems
 </i>
 when studying, rather than going methodically through the list below. I am presenting this list mostly to  show you everything that you have already learned at this point in the class; congratulations, you!!
