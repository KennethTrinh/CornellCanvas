 My partner and I are waiting to get help with our college_named function since there's some issue with it when we try to test it, and so we decided to get started on the menu_listing function.
</p>
<p>
 Obviously, the  helper_tests.py never gets to testing menu_listing since there's an error in college_named, which helper_tests.py tests first.
</p>
<p>
 We wanted to know how we can begin testing and revising our menu_listing function given the nature of helper_tests.py, since helper_tests.py doesn't even get to checking out menu_listing function. Thanks!
</p>

  In
  <code>
   helper_test.py
  </code>
  , you can temporarily comment out line 210 that calls the
  <code>
   test_college_named()
  </code>
  testing function; this will allow the testing to get to
  <code>
   format_check_menu_listings()
  </code>
 </p>
 <p>
  Don't forget to go back and run
  <code>
   test_college_named()
  </code>
  !
 </p>
