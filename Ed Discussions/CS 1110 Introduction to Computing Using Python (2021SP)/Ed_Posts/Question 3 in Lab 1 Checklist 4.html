  Hi! The intent for those instructions in Lab 1A is to prompt/encourage students to talk live to a staff member when you attend the lab section, in-person or online.
 </blockquote>
 <blockquote>
  The lab staff people will check your understanding, plus you'll get to become comfortable with approaching them about any questions you have!
 </blockquote>
 <paragraph>
  So, basically, just attend your lab session and you'll get a consultant or TA to check it off for you!
