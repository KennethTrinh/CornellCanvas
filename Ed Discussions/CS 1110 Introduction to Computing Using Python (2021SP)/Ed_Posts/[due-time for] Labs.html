 Are labs due right after our lab classes, or are they due before 11:59 the day of our lab?

  (Can you let us know where you see any text saying the labs are due right after the lab section?  There might be some stray text from previous runnings of the course that we need to stamp out.)

  Each lab has a due date you can see on the lab system, and they are due at 11:59 pm of the specified date. For lab 3 and 4, itâ€™s Feb 19th and 22nd respectively
