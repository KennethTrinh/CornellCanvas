 I'm getting a key error for the dictionaries. How would we write statement if a key doesn't exist?
</p>

 Starting the tests in this module. Starting test_was_accepted Testing with small_test1.txt Traceback (most recent call last): File "helper_tests.py", line 209, in  test_was_accepted() File "helper_tests.py", line 77, in test_was_accepted colleges = sdu.colleges_from_file(fname) File "/Users/student/Desktop/CS/A5/skeleton-3/sd_utilities_dict.py", line 43, in colleges_from_file process_line(studentline.strip(), unordered_colleges) File "/Users/student/Desktop/CS/A5/skeleton-3/sd_utilities_dict.py", line 107, in process_line if cdict[scname] != {}: KeyError: 'B'

  Here’s an example:
  <break>
  </break>
  dictionary = {“you are a cool person”: “I know”}
 </p>
 <p>
  When you type dictionary[“this is a good question”], it would return in a key error, because “this is a good question” is not in dictionary.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, you would do the following:
  <break>
  </break>
  dictionary{“this is a good question”} = “indeed”
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, dictionary = {“you are a cool person”: “I know”, “this is a good question”: “indeed”}
 </p>
 <p>
  Hope this helps!!!’
 </p>

  Also since values for cdict are only college objects, you need to need to create college objects for colleges not already in cdict.
