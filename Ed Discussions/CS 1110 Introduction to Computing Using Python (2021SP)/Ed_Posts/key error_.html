  I'm getting a key error for the dictionaries. How would we write statement if a key doesn't exist?

  Here’s an example:
  <break>
  </break>
  dictionary = {“you are a cool person”: “I know”}
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  When you type dictionary[“this is a good question”], it would return in a key error, because “this is a good question” is not in dictionary.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  So, you would do the following:
  <break>
  </break>
  dictionary{“this is a good question”} = “indeed”
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Now, dictionary = {“you are a cool person”: “I know”, “this is a good question”: “indeed”}
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Hope this helps!!!’

  Also since values for cdict are only college objects, you need to need to create college objects for colleges not already in cdict.
