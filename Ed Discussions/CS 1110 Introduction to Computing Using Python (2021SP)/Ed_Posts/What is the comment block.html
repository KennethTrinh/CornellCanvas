  Several comments throughout "schedule.py" direct students to not delete "this comment block" so that the graders are able to locate it easily.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Are we expected to keep the entire comment beginning from "STUDENTS:" or only the last statement in all capital letters (Ex ADD_BLOCK) in our final submission?
 </paragraph>

  Thanks for your help!
