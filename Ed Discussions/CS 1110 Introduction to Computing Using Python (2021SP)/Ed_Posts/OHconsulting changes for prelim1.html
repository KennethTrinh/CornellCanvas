 Hi all,
</p>
<p>
 Since we have a prelim on Tuesday March 30, we are moving our usual OH on March 31 (by Mack and Joanna) to before the prelim. Hopefully you will find these additional OH useful for studying for the prelim!
</p>
<p>
 1. Mack's OH is moved to
 <b>
  (Update Sun 3/28): Tuesday March 30, 2:30-3:30pm. [
 </b>
 Was: Tuesday March 30, 3-4pm
 <b>
  ].
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 2. Joanna's OH is moved to
 <b>
  Monday March 29, 3-4pm.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 3. Because of the prelim, consulting hours on
 <b>
  March 30 and March 31 are cancelled.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 I have also updated the course calendar accordingly:
