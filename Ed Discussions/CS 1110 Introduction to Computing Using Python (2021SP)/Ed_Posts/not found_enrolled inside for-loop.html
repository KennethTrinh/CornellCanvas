  Shouldn't the statement if not found enrolled be inside the for-loop? As of now, it's currently outside the loop in the assignment as well as in sd_utilities_dict/sd_utilities_list.

  I wasn't sure if this affects the test cases.

  Short answer: No it should not.  This is because the "if not found_scname" will execute after the while loop (that you need to implement) is done as it is under the "for outcomes in outcome" for loop.  Also, I recommend using dark mode on your text editor, it's easier on the eyes.
