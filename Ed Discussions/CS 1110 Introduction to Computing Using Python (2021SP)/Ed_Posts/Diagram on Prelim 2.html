 I looked through the past prelims and there aren't any diagram questions that don't include subclass. So, I'm wondering if there are practice questions for this type of question that would look similar to what we will have for prelim 2? Thank you!

  I would recommend using the classes questions you found, but skipping the subclasses questions! For instance, one good practice problem would be writing the init, eq, and str functions in 2019FA Q4. Hope that helps!
