 Hi all,
</p>
<p>
 We are canceling all consulting and office hours during wellness days (April 23 - 26).
</p>
<p>
 Instead, we are providing the following additional OH in the next few days to provide extra help with A4 and prelim 2.
</p>
<list style="bullet">
 <li>
  <p>
   <b>
    Friday, April 16
   </b>
   : Brynn will be extending her OH by an hour.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   <b>
    Monday, April 19
   </b>
   : Priya will be extending her OH by an hour.
  </p>
 </li>
</list>
<p>
 As always, you can see the course calendar for the most up-to-date schedule for consulting and office hours. Thanks!
</p>
