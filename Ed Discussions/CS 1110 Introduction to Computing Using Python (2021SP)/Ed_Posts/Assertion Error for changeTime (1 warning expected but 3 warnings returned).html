  Traceback (most recent call last): File ".\schedule_tests.py", line 298, in testfn() # Adding the parentheses calls whatever testfn is File ".\schedule_tests.py", line 257, in test_course_changetime assert roster.warnings == [time_change_warning], ☃☃☃☃☃☃

  AssertionError: roster warnings list should be ['ARCH 1120 STU 520: time changed from TBA to MWF 8:00am-8:00pm'], but is ['ARCH 1120 STU 520: time changed from TBA to MWF 8:00am-8:00pm', 'ARCH 1120 STU 520: time change causes conflict with AEP 3560 LEC 001', 'ARCH 1120 STU 520: time change causes conflict with FAKER 0000 LEC 002']
