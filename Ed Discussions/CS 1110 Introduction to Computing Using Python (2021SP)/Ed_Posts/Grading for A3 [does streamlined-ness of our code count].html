  I was wondering what the grading scheme is like for A3. If the code works will it get full points? Or can you get some points removed if your code is less streamlined than it (maybe) could be?

  Your code will have to obey requirements such as if we asked for something to be implemented using a certain mechanism and you didn't do so, you cannot get credit.

  Your code will also need to work on valid inputs that we didn't supply to you (a program that only works on a few pre-viewed inputs is not correct).

  It's to your benefit for your code to be "clean" and logical, because it's much easier to find bugs in your own code if it's easy to understand.  And it's also easier for us to give partial credit if your code is incorrect but we can easily identify the source of the problem.

  But in CS1110, we do not take (lack of) efficiency into account when grading, unless otherwise noted.
