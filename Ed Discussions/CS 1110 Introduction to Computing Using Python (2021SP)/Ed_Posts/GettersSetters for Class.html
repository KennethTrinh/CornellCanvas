  In the study guide's general section, it says that we will not be asked to define getters/setters for class questions. However, there were no Spring-2021 revised solutions for problems that dealt with getters/setters. For example, in  2017 Fall Prelim Q5, the solution is stated as:
 </paragraph>
 <figure>
  <image height="427" src="https://static.us.edusercontent.com/files/DGKQoist0We23RHpkfcGdesN" width="509"/>
 </figure>
 <paragraph>
  If changed to spring 2021 methods, would the answer be the following? (excluding any assert statements)
 </paragraph>
 <list style="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    self._name = name
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    self._start = start
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <paragraph>
    self._size = size
   </paragraph>
  </list-item>
 </list>
