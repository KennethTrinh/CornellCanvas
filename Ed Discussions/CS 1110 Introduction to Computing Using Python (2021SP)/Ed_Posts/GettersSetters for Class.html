 In the study guide's general section, it says that we will not be asked to define getters/setters for class questions. However, there were no Spring-2021 revised solutions for problems that dealt with getters/setters. For example, in  2017 Fall Prelim Q5, the solution is stated as:
</p>

</figure>
<p>
 If changed to spring 2021 methods, would the answer be the following? (excluding any assert statements)
</p>
<list style="bullet">
 <li>
  <p>
   self._name = name
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   self._start = start
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   self._size = size
  </p>
 </li>
</list>
