 I used spaces (4 for one indentation) for all my work but it seems like 4 spaces automatically become one tab. I've also clicked on the "convert all tabs to spaces" button to see if anything changes but everything is still remaining as tabs. Is this normal?

  Yeah, don’t worry about it. It’s still indented with spaces
