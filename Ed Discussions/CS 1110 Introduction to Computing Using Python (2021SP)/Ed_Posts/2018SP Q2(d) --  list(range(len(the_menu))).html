  Put in your question title the year, semester, and question.  Ideal would also be to include the topic.   Example: 2018SP Q2(b) - call frames
 </callout>
 <callout type="info">
  Include a screenshot of the question, so readers/answerers don't have to go find the relevant pdf.

  (It looks as though it will create a list with all of the elements of the range iterable, namely [0,1,2,...,len(the_menu)-1]. Someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think this would affect the functionality though - you could probably just use a normal range loop?

  Hi,

  You do not have to use list, a range loop without list would also be a correct implementation.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Here is an example of printing list(range(example))))
 </paragraph>
 <snippet language="py" line-numbers="true" runnable="true">
  <snippet-file id="code">
   example = ['hello', 'hi']
print(list(range(len(example))))
  </snippet-file>
 </snippet>

  Using list would just list every number in the range of example.  It is equivalent to a normal range loop.  If you loop through this list, the for loop would iterate through every number in the list.
  <break>
  </break>

  Best,
