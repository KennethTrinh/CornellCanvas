<callout type="info">
 Put in your question title the year, semester, and question.  Ideal would also be to include the topic.   Example: 2018SP Q2(b) - call frames
</callout>
<callout type="info">
 Include a screenshot of the question, so readers/answerers don't have to go find the relevant pdf.
</callout>
<p>
 can someone explain what list(range(len(the_menu))) does? more specifically the list aspect of it?

  Hi,
 </p>
 <p>
  You do not have to use list, a range loop without list would also be a correct implementation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here is an example of printing list(range(example))))
 </p>
 <snippet language="py" line-numbers="true" runnable="true">
  <snippet-file id="code">
   example = ['hello', 'hi']
print(list(range(len(example))))
  </snippet-file>
 </snippet>
 <p>
  Using list would just list every number in the range of example.  It is equivalent to a normal range loop.  If you loop through this list, the for loop would iterate through every number in the list.
  <break>
  </break>
 </p>
 <p>
  Best,
 </p>
 <p>
  Troy

   (It looks as though it will create a list with all of the elements of the range iterable, namely [0,1,2,...,len(the_menu)-1]. Someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think this would affect the functionality though - you could probably just use a normal range loop?
