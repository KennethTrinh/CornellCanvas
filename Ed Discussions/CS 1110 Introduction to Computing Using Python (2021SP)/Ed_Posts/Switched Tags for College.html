 I tested sd_utilities_dict and sd_utilities_list on showdown_time_a5 but the tag of Yale_U and UC-Los_Angeles is switched when I change from list to dict. Also, it is only for these two colleges. Everything else stays the same and the results are the same.

 I'm not quite sure why the two colleges' tags are being switched. If anyone could help me understand this problem, it would be greatly appreciated.
