 Put in your question title the year, semester, and question.  Ideal would also be to include the topic.   Example: 2018SP Q2(b) - call frames

 Include a screenshot of the question, so readers/answerers don't have to go find the relevant pdf.

  Please follow the instructions about how to title your post if it is about previous exam questions --- makes it easier to see what a question is referring to, and if a question might be a duplicate.
