 On page 3 of the assignment sheet it says, "Rewrite the body of sd_utilities_list.process_line() as directed in the file to replace the for-loop over clist with one or more while-loops that don’t go over unnecessary parts of clist." I have 2 while-loops right now that go over the same parts of clist but check for 2 different things. I'm trying to change it to just 1loop but I keep getting incorrect input. I plan on getting the problem sorted but if I can't by the deadline, will this get me points deducted?

  I suggest watching the pre-class videos for while loops, they helped me code the process_line function for sd_utilities_list

  Using 2 while loops is fine as long as they don't go over unnecessary parts of clist, as directed in the instructions to "
  <i>
   replace the for-loop over clist with
   <b>
    one or more while-loops
   </b>
   that don’t go over unnecessary parts of clist
  </i>
  ". We will also grade your A5 based on correctness and meaningful use of while loops instead of efficiency.
