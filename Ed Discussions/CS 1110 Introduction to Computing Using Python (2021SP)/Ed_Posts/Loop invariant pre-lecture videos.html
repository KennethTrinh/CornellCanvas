  Thank god whew we made it.

  I was wondering if there is a link for pre-lecture videos or any cs 1110 resources for loop invariants in Python. I know that it was not in the final exam but I think it will be better to have exposure before diving into it further for my next class, cs 2110.

  With that said, would there be any pre-lecture videos that discuss loop invariants (or any related cs 1110 material?)

  Thanks in advance!

  Loop invariants have not been covered in CS 1110 since Fall 2019 and you will cover them in enough detail to understand them when you are in CS 2110. That being said, if you want to learn about them you may find the following resources helpful:

  Here's a writeup I was involved in that includes code in python 2 with ASCII animations by yours truly.  Gimme maybe 15 minutes, and I should be able to translate to python 3.

  I like reasoning with invariants quite a lot; they are a good reasoning tool, once you get used to 'em!

  Oh, hilarious, the code link mentioned in the pdf is broken.  Time to do some historical digging.

  Here is a python3, standalone version of the code mentioned in that pdf!
