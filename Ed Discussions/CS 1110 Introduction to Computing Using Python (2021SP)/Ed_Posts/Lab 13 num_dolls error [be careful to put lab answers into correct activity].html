 I inserted my function call into the Lab 13 answer box and there is in fact a recursive call in my function. Additionally, the function definition I wrote passed all the test cases yet the Lab continues to give me the following error:
</p>
<p>
 "I could not find a recursive call in your function body."
</p>
<p>
 Any help with this problem would be appreciated.

  The lab server on our end is showing "not graded" for you, as if it has not recorded an entry for you.
 </p>
 <p>
  ... upon further investigation, you've entered your num_dolls function into the sum_it activity.

  </break>
  Put the num_dolls function into the num_dolls text box and submit, and things should work as you expect.

     By the way, having made a number of quite public typos for CS1110 in the past, I'm in no position to judge!
