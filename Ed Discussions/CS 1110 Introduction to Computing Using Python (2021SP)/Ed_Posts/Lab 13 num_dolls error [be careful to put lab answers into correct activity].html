  I inserted my function call into the Lab 13 answer box and there is in fact a recursive call in my function. Additionally, the function definition I wrote passed all the test cases yet the Lab continues to give me the following error:

 <paragraph>
  "I could not find a recursive call in your function body."

  Any help with this problem would be appreciated.

  The lab server on our end is showing "not graded" for you, as if it has not recorded an entry for you.

  ... upon further investigation, you've entered your num_dolls function into the sum_it activity.

  Put the num_dolls function into the num_dolls text box and submit, and things should work as you expect.

  By the way, having made a number of quite public typos for CS1110 in the past, I'm in no position to judge!
