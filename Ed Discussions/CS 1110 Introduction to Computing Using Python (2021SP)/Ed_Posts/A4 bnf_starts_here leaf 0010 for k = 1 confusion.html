  I'm a little confused with the how I'm supposed to handle leaf 0010. With one minor change to my code, I can achieve both of the seemingly contradictory outputs:
 </paragraph>
 <pre>Wrongly found back-and-forth for users A and B at Post 0010 for k=1
</pre>
 <pre>Missed back-and-forth for users A and B at Post 0010 for k=1
</pre>
 <paragraph>
  Is there something I'm fundamentally misunderstanding about this part of the assignment? I was under the impression that by the k = 1 case in the recursive definition, this should be an instance where False is
  <italic>
   not
  </italic>
  returned (and in the case where I try false, I get the latter of my two outputs, while returning an output yields the former).
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thanks!

  Let me first clear something up. For the k = 1 case, there are times where you would like to return False. I found the footnote on page 8 to be rather useful for figuring out these cases when I did the assignment myself.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  For the back-and-forth between users A and B at Post 0010 where k = 1, we should return a single element list containing just post 0010. The first error would occur if you returned a list that isn't as specified above, and the second error would occur if you returned false as there is a back-and-forth.
