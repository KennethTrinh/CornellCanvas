  Hi all!
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Just wanted to confirm something - when commenting to indicate bad test cases, the prompt was given as:
 </paragraph>

 <paragraph>
  However, when we set up Atom, we were instructed to have the indent as four spaces (and so it appears in the majority of the code), not three, as it appears before and after STUDENT-FIXED ERROR. Should we be using 3 or 4? (and does it matter? - just wanted to check in case you guys were using code to check which ones we indicated as errors, and it might get thrown off by an indent error.

  Just to clarify, could you tell me exactly which lines you’re saying are indented only by 3 originally?

  The 2nd line down - I only see 3 dots in the code posted on the instructions, and was just wondering if it mattered (3 vs. 4 for an indent)

  Edit: I went back and looked, and it didn't even save any spaces after ERROR, so my guess is it doesn't matter

  Indentation only matters when it comes to actual lines of code, so no need to worry about how indented anything inside comments is. Of course don’t do anything crazy, and just align the “#” to the indentation of the code you’re commenting
