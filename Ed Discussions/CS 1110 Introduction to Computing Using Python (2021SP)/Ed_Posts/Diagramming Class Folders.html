  Hi all,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For Prelim 2, I'm a little confused on how you would like us to diagram class folder. Previously, when diagraming folders in the heap, we use the id of a folder to reference it. In the pre-lecture videos, however, the folder was presented differently, with the class name (not the id) identifying it. Is there a preferred diagram (or does it matter)?

  Thanks!

  Class folders have a different notation (so you can easily distinguish them from (other) object folders):  "tab" on top right-hand side, name of class on the tab.  (See also the study guide for some remarks on drawing class folders.)

  Non-class objects stay the same: tab on the top-left-hand side, id on the tab, type of the object on the upper-right.

  Example from

  Lec 17 slides of a class folder.

  Thank you! Should we therefore not include an id for the class folder in the global space?
