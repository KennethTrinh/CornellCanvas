  Regular Schedules don't care if there's course conflicts; StudentSchedules do and so warnings of course conflicts should be placed in StudentSchedules, but not Schedules.

  See the a6_in_action results in the A6 handout: there are fewer warnings in the StudentSchedule "My Plan A" than there are in the Schedule "Cornell Fall 21 roster"
