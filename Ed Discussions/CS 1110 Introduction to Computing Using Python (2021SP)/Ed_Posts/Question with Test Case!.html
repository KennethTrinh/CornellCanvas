 Hello!
</p>
<p>
 According to the test case print, ARCH 1120 MWF 8am-8pm is not supposed to conflict with anything but our code finds a conflict with AEP 3567 MWF 9:05-9:55am which we thought is supposed to be a conflict.
</p>
<p>
 Are we not supposed to put these time conflicts within the roster warning list?
</p>

  If the assert that is failing is the one on line 256, it might be because (copied from test file) -
 </p>
 <pre>    # `roster` should only have a warning that the time changed, because it is a
    # Schedule and so doesn't need warnings about time conflicts
</pre>
 <p>
  so StudentSchedules and normal Schedules should have different behavior in this case.
 </p>
 <p>
  If your code is failing in a different test case, let us know which

   Hi! So does that mean we have to add the warning to the student Schedule list of warnings not the normal schedule?

    The Course.in_schedule is student schedules right?

     Regular Schedules don't care if there's course conflicts; StudentSchedules do and so warnings of course conflicts should be placed in StudentSchedules, but not Schedules.

     See the a6_in_action results in the A6 handout: there are fewer warnings in the StudentSchedule "My Plan A" than there are in the Schedule "Cornell Fall 21 roster"
