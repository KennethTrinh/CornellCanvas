 From the assignment instructions:
</p>
<p>
 Since we haven’t covered class definitions in detail yet, assume that the creation of a new object and initialization of its attributes happen in one step, and no call frame is generated.5
</p>
<p>
 5That is, for now, don’t worry about the __init__ method in a class or draw a frame for it, even though Python Tutor does.
</p>
<p>
 Does this mean other method calls (ie. _ str _) can be ignored as well?

  Yes! Ignore anything that happens inside constructor classes (that is, inside classes like class timer.py in lab 8) in regards to frame creation.
