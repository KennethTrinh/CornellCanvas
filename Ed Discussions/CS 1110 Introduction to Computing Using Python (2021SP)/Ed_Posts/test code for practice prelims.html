 Put in your question title the year, semester, and question.  Ideal would also be to include the topic.   Example: 2018SP Q2(b) - call frames
</callout>
<callout type="info">
 Include a screenshot of the question, so readers/answerers don't have to go find the relevant pdf.

 In order to run our test codes for the previous exam do we have to make our own skeleton or can we run it in the one file you gave us?

  For most of the previous exams, I think I put skeletons in the test case so you can just run the one file.

  I might not have had time to make the skeletons for one or two of the previous exams, though, but in which case you can write your own skeletons into the testing code.
