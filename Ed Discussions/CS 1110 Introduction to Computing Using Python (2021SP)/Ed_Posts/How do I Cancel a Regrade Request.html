  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Last night, I submitted two regrade requests on Prelim 2, each for a different question.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Upon reviewing my requests today (to make sure they were valid), I noticed I wrongly claimed that I unnecessarily lost points for Question 1 (For-Loops). However, I still believe my other regrade request for Question 4 (Testing and Analyzing Recursion) makes sense.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  How can I unsubmit my faulty request for Question 1 to save my grader's time without removing my request for Question 4? I'm having trouble finding the option to do so on GradeScope.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  To that end, how long do regrade requests usually take?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thanks so much!

  As per the canvas announcement, they will be completed at some point after the regrade request deadline (which is May 10)
