 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 Last night, I submitted two regrade requests on Prelim 2, each for a different question.
</p>
<p>
 Upon reviewing my requests today (to make sure they were valid), I noticed I wrongly claimed that I unnecessarily lost points for Question 1 (For-Loops). However, I still believe my other regrade request for Question 4 (Testing and Analyzing Recursion) makes sense.
</p>
<p>
 How can I unsubmit my faulty request for Question 1 to save my grader's time without removing my request for Question 4? I'm having trouble finding the option to do so on GradeScope.
</p>
<p>
 To that end, how long do regrade requests usually take?
</p>
<p>
 Thanks so much!
</p>

 <p>
  is there a way for you to edit or add to the text of your request?

 <p>
  As per the canvas announcement, they will be completed at some point after the regrade request deadline (which is May 10)
