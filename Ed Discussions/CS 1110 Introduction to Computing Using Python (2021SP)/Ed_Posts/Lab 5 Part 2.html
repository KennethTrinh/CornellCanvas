  Hello,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For lab 5 part 2, it says to "enter the line of code I think will work" and I'm not sure what you mean by that. Nonetheless, I entered random commands, then I finished the other steps and got an error message: NameError: name 'hours_int' is not defined. I need help

  The lab question is, basically, “Given timestr (a valid time string as established by the precondition in the previous activity of the lab), store an int that contains the hours of timestr into hours_int”.

  You shouldn’t be placing commands as shown in the section about testing, those are just for you to test the code you wrote personally
