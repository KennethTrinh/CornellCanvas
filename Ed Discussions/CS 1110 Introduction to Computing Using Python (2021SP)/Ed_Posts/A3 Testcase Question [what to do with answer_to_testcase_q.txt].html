 I am a bit confused about what we actually have to do in order to fill out the answer_to_testcase_q file. It says to work out a test case so does this mean using one of the ones already done in Section 5.1 or is it creating our own test case with random student tags while using the two colleges indicated in the file?

  Hi, does section 5.2.2 of the handout answer the question?

   No, not really. I am not sure how small_test1.txt will help me complete the test case as there are no colleges listed for accepted, rejected, and chosen college in that file.

    Ah, I see your question.  You have to fill in (by hand)
    <b>
     all
    </b>
    the question marks, using the information available to you, as a human reader, when you look at the file small_test1.txt, which has a just a few colleges and student tags in it.

     (The format is explained in the handout; so 'A' is the name of a college in small_test1.txt, for instance.)
