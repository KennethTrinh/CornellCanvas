 What files or file am I supposed to run in order to check to see if my showndown_time function is working properly? I tried looking at the assignment but it just states to compare the supposed output with the sample runs file.

  The sample runs files are the only testing "apparatus" we are providing for you.

  (You are welcome to create your own testing files if you wish.)
