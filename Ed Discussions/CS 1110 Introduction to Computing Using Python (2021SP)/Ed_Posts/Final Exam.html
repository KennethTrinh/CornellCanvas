  I see on the syllabus that the final exam is cumulative. We will not have been tested on any lectures since the Prelim 2, though. Will the final exam be more heavily focused on these lectures? Or pretty evenly balanced on the material throughout the semester? Thank you!

  The final will be kind of spread out across the semester's material.

  We do want to allow some degree of "catch-up" for students who may have struggled early on but have mastered the course content by the end of the semester.  This is why the final exam has a relatively heavy weight.

  We will be looking to see whether students understand string processing, memory in Python (object diagramming), for- and while-loops and control flow,  lists and related data structures (dictionaries are kind of a cross between lists and "standard" objects), recursion, classes and subclasses and code organization (e.g., using helper functions), testing and debugging, sorting and searching.

   Look back on your A1 (as A6 sort of does) and pat yourself on the back for how much you have learned since then!
