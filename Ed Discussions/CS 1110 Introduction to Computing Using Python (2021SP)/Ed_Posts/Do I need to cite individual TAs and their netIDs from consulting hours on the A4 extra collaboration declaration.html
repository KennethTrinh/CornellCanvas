 I submitted A4 with “Consulting Hours” next to Consulted/Collaborated field.
</p>
<p>
 I went to consulting hours a few times for A4 as well as Brynn’s office hours, and it was my only source help.  I forgot the names and netIDs of the TAs (except one) that helped me.  Is that an issue?

  It would be fine to do that if you think you got a lot of guidance from a TA and modeled your code very closely to what they were telling you, but
  <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs1110/2021sp/policies/cs1110integrity.html">
   the AI policy of the class states the following:
