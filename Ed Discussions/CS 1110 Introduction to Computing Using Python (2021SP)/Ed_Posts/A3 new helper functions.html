 Hi there,
</p>
<p>
 Just checking -- if we find it useful to write a new helper function for one of the given functions to call, can we? E.g. if I wanted to write a helper function that is called by
 <i>
  was_accepted
 </i>
</p>
<p>
 Also, if it is the new helper function rather than the given function (e.g.
 <i>
  was_accepted
 </i>
 ) that uses a loop, does that still meet the requirements for the assignment?
</p>

  1: Yes! Highly encouraged to do so if you think it would be useful.
 </p>
 <p>
  2: Yes!
 </p>
 <p>
  Remember though: you have to write a specification for your helper function
