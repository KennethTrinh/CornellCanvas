  Hi there,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Just checking -- if we find it useful to write a new helper function for one of the given functions to call, can we? E.g. if I wanted to write a helper function that is called by
  <italic>
   was_accepted
  </italic>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Also, if it is the new helper function rather than the given function (e.g.
  <italic>
   was_accepted
  </italic>
  ) that uses a loop, does that still meet the requirements for the assignment?

  1: Yes! Highly encouraged to do so if you think it would be useful.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2: Yes!
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Remember though: you have to write a specification for your helper function
