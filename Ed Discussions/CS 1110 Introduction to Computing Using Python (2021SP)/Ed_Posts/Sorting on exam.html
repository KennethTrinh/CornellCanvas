  On the exam, will we be responsible for writing unique searching or sorting algorithms, or analysing sorting or searching algorithms that we learned?

  Hi, you wouldn't need to write new algorithms, but you should feel OK writing the ones that were gone over in lecture.

  Thank you! Do you know if there is any practice on old exams that pertain to the sorting and searching algorithms we discussed?

  A lot of the old exams having their sorting/searching questions based on invariants. So those questions

   could

  be used, but you'd have to be aware that there would be a lot of alternate solutions available that aren't based on the given invariant.

  So perhaps best is to see if you re-implement the algorithms given in class from scratch.
