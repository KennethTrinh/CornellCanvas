 I don't really understand why we are changing the menu_listing function for utilities_dict, if the code placed there already works. Could someone please explain? Thanks!

  The code already in place for menu_listing function in sd_utilities_dict does not work on its own; as a result, you have to modify it so that it is compatible with dictionaries. I believe the code already implemented works with lists and not dictionaries. Remember that you cannot index a dictionary with a number, like cdict[1].
 </p>
 <p>
  For instance, when you call cdict["cornell_u"], you will return the college object.  You do not want to return the college object, just the name of the college. so think of a way to do that.

   Adding to this question, I got my code to work but I am not sure how "different" of an implementation we are supposed to use? My code looks very similar to the code that was already there, but now works for the dict.

    Hello!!
   </p>
   <p>
    You only need to make a very minor change to menu_listing for sd_utilities_dict to work! Your code is supposed to look similar to that of sd_utilities_list menu_list, but with one small adjustment, which is to make menu_lisiting work with dictionaries.

     yes, as the student answer says, the dictionary version of the function could look very structurally similar
