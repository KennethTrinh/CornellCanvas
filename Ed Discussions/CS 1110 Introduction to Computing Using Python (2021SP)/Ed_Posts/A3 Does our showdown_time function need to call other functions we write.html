 If we were able to write showdown_time without calling was_accepted or college_named, and it works, is that fine?

 I didn't notice was_accepted being called in showdown_time.py, so I'm a bit confused if we needed to use it somehow, or is it sufficient to just pass the helper_tests?

  It's possible to write
  <code>
   showdown_time
  </code>
  without calling
  <code>
   was_accepted
  </code>
  - your
  <code>
   showdown_time
  </code>
  will just be duplicating some code that will appear in
  <code>
   was_accepted
  </code>
  .  But if you look at the assignment handout, section 5.3, it says "you should (and are required) to use"
  <code>
   was_accepted
  </code>
  .

   So, just to be perfectly clear: you must use
   <code>
    was_accepted()
   </code>
   because that's what the handout says, and the code part we gave you in
   <code>
    showdown_time()
   </code>
   already calls
   <code>
    college_named
   </code>
   , and you were NOT supposed to delete those lines:
   <break>
   </break>
  </p>
  <pre><b># STUDENTS: leave this code block alone!</b> 
c1 = sdu.college_named(c1name, colleges) 
c2 = sdu.college_named(c2name, colleges)
</pre>
