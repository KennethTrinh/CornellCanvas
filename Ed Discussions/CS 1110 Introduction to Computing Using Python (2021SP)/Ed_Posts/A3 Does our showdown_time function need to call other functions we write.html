  If we were able to write showdown_time without calling was_accepted or college_named, and it works, is that fine?

  I didn't notice was_accepted being called in showdown_time.py, so I'm a bit confused if we needed to use it somehow, or is it sufficient to just pass the helper_tests?

  It's possible to write
  <code>
   showdown_time
  </code>
  without calling
  <code>
   was_accepted
  </code>
  - your
  <code>
   showdown_time
  </code>
  will just be duplicating some code that will appear in
  <code>
   was_accepted
  </code>
  .  But if you look at the assignment handout, section 5.3, it says "you should (and are required) to use"
  <code>
   was_accepted
  </code>
  .

  So, just to be perfectly clear: you must use
  <code>
   was_accepted()
  </code>
  because that's what the handout says, and the code part we gave you in
  <code>
   showdown_time()
  </code>
  already calls
  <code>
   college_named
  </code>
  , and you were NOT supposed to delete those lines:
  <break>
  </break>
 </paragraph>
 <pre><bold># STUDENTS: leave this code block alone!</bold> 
c1 = sdu.college_named(c1name, colleges) 
c2 = sdu.college_named(c2name, colleges)
</pre>
