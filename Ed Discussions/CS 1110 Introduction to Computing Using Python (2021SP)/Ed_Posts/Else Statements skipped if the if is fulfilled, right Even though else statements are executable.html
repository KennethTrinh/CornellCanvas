 Hi all!
</p>
<p>
 Just a general question - when using conditionals, suppose that the "if" statement was fulfilled and was run. When Python looks at an "else" statement, is that line run, or just skipped over? I saw on the document that "else-statements should be treated as executable (and executed) lines.", but wasn't sure if this was only when the else statement is run. Thanks!

  Follow up question on this: suppose the "if" statement is not fulfilled, therefore skipping to the "else statement". For visualization purposes, will we need to write down and then cross out the line number of the "else statement" or do we not write anything for it in the instruction counter of a call frame?
 </p>
 <p>
  i.e.:
 </p>
 <p>
  (1) if 1&lt;0:
 </p>
 <p>
  (2)     ...
 </p>
 <p>
  (3)    return x
 </p>
 <p>
  (4) else:
 </p>
 <p>
  (5)    return y
 </p>
 <p>
  Would the instruction counter be just 5, or 4 and 5?
 </p>

  If the "if" statement is fulfilled, the "else" line is not run.
