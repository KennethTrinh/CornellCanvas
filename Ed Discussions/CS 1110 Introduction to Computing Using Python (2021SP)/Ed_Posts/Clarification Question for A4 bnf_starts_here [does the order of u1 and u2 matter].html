 In the instructions for a4, it says: "A back-and-forth of length k between user u1 and (different) user u2 starts at a post P if (and only if) P was written by u1and ..."
</p>
<p>
 Does this mean that u1 and u2 are not interchangable and that a relevant back-and-forth must start with u1 (i.e the calls bnf_starts_here(0, 'A', 'B', 3) and bnf_starts_here(0, 'B', 'A', 3) are not evaluated equivalently)?

  That is right --- who "started the interchange" matters.
