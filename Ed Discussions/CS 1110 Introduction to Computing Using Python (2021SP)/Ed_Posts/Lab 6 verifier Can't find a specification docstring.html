 Is there a trick to getting the verifier in Lab 6 part 1 to accept my code? My code produced all correct results in lab05_test.py but the verifier won't take it. Any common issues I should check for? This is the feedback from the verifier:
</p>
<blockquote>
 Can't find a specification docstring.
 <break>
 </break>
 The system's verifier seems unhappy. ....Debug info for staff:
 <break>
 </break>
 flag_header returned 3, couldn't find spec
 <break>
 </break>
 flag_function returned 0, success!
 <break>
 </break>
 flag_conditionals_or_pass returned 0, success!
</blockquote>

  Did you include the docstring that should go at the beginning of the function (after def)? You can find at the top of lab 6, part 1
