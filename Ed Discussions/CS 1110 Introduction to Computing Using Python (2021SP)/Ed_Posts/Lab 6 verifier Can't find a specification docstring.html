  Is there a trick to getting the verifier in Lab 6 part 1 to accept my code? My code produced all correct results in lab05_test.py but the verifier won't take it. Any common issues I should check for? This is the feedback from the verifier:
 </paragraph>
 <blockquote>
  Can't find a specification docstring.
  <break>
  </break>
  The system's verifier seems unhappy. ....Debug info for staff:
  <break>
  </break>
  flag_header returned 3, couldn't find spec
  <break>
  </break>
  flag_function returned 0, success!
  <break>
  </break>
  flag_conditionals_or_pass returned 0, success!

  Did you include the docstring that should go at the beginning of the function (after def)? You can find at the top of lab 6, part 1
