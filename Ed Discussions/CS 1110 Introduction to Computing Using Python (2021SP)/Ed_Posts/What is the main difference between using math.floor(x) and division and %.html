  math.floor(x) is a function takes x as input and returns the largest integer &lt;= x.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Eg.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  math.floor(7.8) = 7
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  math.floor(-1.2) = -2

  / is a binary operator that is used like this : a / b where a and b can be floats or integers. This operator results in the quotient you get on dividing a by b. There is no rounding up/down going on here, you get the answer as a float, as precise as Python can get it.

 <paragraph>
  Eg.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  6/7 = 0.8571428571428571
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  6/4 = 1.5
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  6.0/4.0 = 1.5
 </paragraph>

  % is a binary operator that is used like this : a % b where a and be can be floats or integers. This operator results in the remainder you get on dividing a by b. If both a an b are integers, you get an integer result, if at least one of a and b is a float you get a float result.

  Eg.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  6%4 = 2
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  6.0%4 = 2.0
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  6%4.0 = 2.0
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  6.0%4.0 = 2.0
