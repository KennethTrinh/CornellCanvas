 How can I access an object from its attribute? In function `changeTime(self, newtime)`, where I need to see if newtime conflicts with any Course already in a StudentSchedule, how would I be able to first access the object that newtime belongs to?

  <code>
   newtime
  </code>
  here is a string, so it itself doesn't below to any object.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  But let's say I had a course
  <code>
   c
  </code>
  , and I wanted to check if its (new) time conflicts with any other course
  <b>
   in the StudentSchedules that c is in.
  </b>
  (I don't care if the new time conflicts for courses in any Schedule that
  <code>
   c
  </code>
  isn't in.)
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  But conceptually, we need to do the following
  <break>
  </break>
 </p>
 <pre>
for every schedule that c is in,     <i># Is there an attribute of <code>c</code> that relates to this information?</i>

       if that schedule is a StudentSchedule, # <i>how do we check the type of an object?</i>

                check if there's any course in that StudentSchedule that conflicts with <code>c</code>: <i># have you written a conflictsWith() method that can help?</i> 

                          if so, add a warning to that StudentSchedule. <i># where are the warnings for a StudentSchedule kept?</i>

                
</pre>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  I'm now going to look for a sample worked problem that can be used as an example.
