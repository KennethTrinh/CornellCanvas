 I know that getters and setters weren't covered for the second prelim, but is there a chance that they will be covered on the final, or was that not covered in the scope of the course?

  Hi,
 </p>

  "In general, Fall class and sub-class questions have included sub-problems involving implementing getters and setters, mutable vs. immutable attributes, and asserting preconditions. We will not have such subproblems, but other parts of the class and sub-class questions are fair game." (
