  My partner and I have finished our assignment and were wondering if we're only supposed to submit a1_first.py and the acknowledgment_policy.py?

  Do we submit a1_second.py for Part B?

  For now, you’re just submitting a1_first and acknowledgement policy. There will be a different ‘assignment’ on CMS for a1 second. Check Section 2 of the handout for more information.
