 My partner and I have finished our assignment and were wondering if we're only supposed to submit a1_first.py and the acknowledgment_policy.py?
</p>
<p>
 Do we submit a1_second.py for Part B?
</p>

  For now, you’re just submitting a1_first and acknowledgement policy. There will be a different ‘assignment’ on CMS for a1 second. Check Section 2 of the handout for more information.
