  1.  For the text document and our lists, we are only graded on the correct contents (as in the correct tags and the correct total number of tags) rather than the order of them right?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. Do we have to erase all comments originally present in the skeleton code (the STUDENTS: prompts) before submitting or can we just make sure our work is readable and leave them there?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  3. Do the values of small_test and show_sd_internals matter after we finish testing it? Like should we submit it with small_test = False and show_sd_internals = True?
 </paragraph>

  Thank you!

  1. Yes! From page 9 of the handout:
 </paragraph>
 <blockquote>
  But: warning: it is possible that your computer might assign different menu numbers than what is listed here,as ties in number of applications might be broken differently than the way Prof. Leeâ€™s did.
 </blockquote>

  2. No!
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  3. Yes! From 6.2:
 </paragraph>
 <blockquote>
  #STUDENTS: when you're sure your code is done,
 </blockquote>
 <blockquote>
  # change these variables to False for full functionality!
 </blockquote>

  (Although to be honest, our auto-grader isn't going to run your code under the
  <code>
   if __main__
  </code>
  ... line anyway, so don't worry if you forget to set those particular variables to the specified values  at submission time.)
