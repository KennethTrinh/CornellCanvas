  Hi I have 3 short questions:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  1. Are empty lines counted in the instructor counter?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. Is the else line counted in the instructor counter? (I assumed no because python is not evaluating anything for this line, unlike the if statement line)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  3. Do objects in the heap space get the function definition variables included in the folder? For example do the functions _init_ and _str_ get drawn in the folder, when we call the object, Book?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thank you!

  * item 7 "Don’t draw the objects (folders) for imported modules or for function definitions."
  <break>
  </break>
  * item 9 "Since we haven’t covered class definitions in detail yet, assume that the creation of a new object and initialization of its attributes happen in one step, and no call frame is generated", with footnote 5

  where footnote 5 says, "That is, for now, don’t worry about the __init__ method in a class or draw a frame for it, even though Python Tutor does."
