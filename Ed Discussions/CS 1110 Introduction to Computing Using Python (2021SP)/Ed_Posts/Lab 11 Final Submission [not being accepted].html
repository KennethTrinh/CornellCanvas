  Hey,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I'm having an issue with the final submission for lab 11 where my code passes all the tests and I get the correct printout, but when I submit it it says that it is incorrect. The weird thing is, the "resubmit" button is missing and I can't do anything except exit by clicking on the "lab grades" button and then navigating back to the page. If anyone has encountered this problem and has a solution, please let me know. Thanks!

  The output you pasted started by "Drew the following," but there is more to the output before it that you should be including too.

  Mine is still not submitting correctly even including the total output above that line. Are there any other possibilities why it still isn't working?

  I think you might have a print statement in test_draw_poker_hand you might have been using for debugging you forgot to remove!

  I took out the print statements in that function as well as test_less_than and test_draw and it's still not submitting. What should I do?

  If you did not add those print statements to those functions (they were provided to you), please leave them there (add them back)! Those are necessary for your output. Try checking your actual implementation of each of the functions and see if there are any print statements you added on any of the functions. If you did, please remove them

  It's still not submitting for me and I know someone else having the same problem. Should we email screenshots for credit or how else should we fix it to submit correctly?

  Looks like you have credit in the lab system, so I assume you are all set!
