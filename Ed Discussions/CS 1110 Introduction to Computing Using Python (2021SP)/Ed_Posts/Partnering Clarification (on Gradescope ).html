  Hello, everyone! Just a quick question about partnering in Assignment 2. Once we have our partner and do the assignment, only one of us submits to Gradescope, correct? Is there anything else we need to do to indicate that we have partnered or is that it? Thank you, and sorry for the long question!

  Yes, that is correct!

  (And I agree this protocol seems a little odd, but I'm not the one designing software used across the nation. There were various tradeoffs behind the scenes in deciding whether to use Gradescope or CMS for A2.)
