<p>
 In the first example here, there is a "pm" after the 4:00
</p>
<p>
 In the second example, there is no "am" or "pm" indicated after the 9:05
</p>
<p>
 Is it acceptable either way -- for there to be (or not to be) an "am" or "pm" indicated in this first position, after the start time?
</p>
<p>
 (These are the actual examples given in 8.3)

  Thank you for catching that! That seems to be a typo in the A6 handout --  a meeting time, in its "roster format", should always include an "am" or a "pm", according to Course's init function's precondition for the variable t that's supposed to represent the "roster format":
 </p>
 <pre>t: string of the form (no beginning or trailing spaces)
    &lt;days&gt; &lt;starthrs&gt;:&lt;startms&gt;&lt;am or pm&gt;-&lt;endhrs&gt;-&lt;endms&gt;&lt;am or pm&gt;
   where &lt;days&gt; is a subsequence of "MTWRF"
   ***OR***
   the string "TBA"

Examples of valid values for t:
"MWF 10:10am-2:30pm"
"R 8:07am-11:00am"
"TBA"
</pre>
 <p>
  So, please consider the example given in 8.3 of A6 handout to be “MWF 9:05am-9:55am”!

   Yes, it's a typo; I'm sorry about that! It's now fixed in the handout.
