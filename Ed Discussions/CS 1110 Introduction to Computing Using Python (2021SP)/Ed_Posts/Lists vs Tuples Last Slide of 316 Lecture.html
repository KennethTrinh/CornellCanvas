 I still don't understand why lists are better for homogenous sequences while tuples are better for heterogenous sequences when both can be used for any type of object?

  This is actually a topic of

   some debate

   One view:  the authors of Python describe this as an observation about common usage, rather than a rule or recommendation. From
   <link href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequences"/>
   https://docs.python.org/3.8/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequences:

  Though tuples may seem similar to lists, they are often used in different situations and for different purposes. Tuples are
  <link href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/glossary.html#term-immutable"/>
  immutable, and usually contain a heterogeneous sequence of elements that are accessed via unpacking (see later in this section) or indexing (or even by attribute in the case of
  <link href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple"/>
  <code>
   namedtuples
  </code>
  ). Lists are
  <link href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/glossary.html#term-mutable"/>
  mutable
  , and their elements are usually homogeneous and are accessed by iterating over the list.
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  A second view: lists have a builtin
  <code>
   sort
  </code>
  method, and these and other notions being built in to lists makes it seem like the thinking of the Python designers is that the items in a list should be comparable such that "sorting" would make sense.
