 If a class ends at 9:30am and the other class begins at 9:30am, is this still considered to be conflicting schedules?

  Hi,
 </p>
 <p>
  The following is the specification for the conflictsWith function:
 </p>
 <snippet language="py" line-numbers="true" runnable="false">
  <snippet-file id="code">
   def conflictsWith(self, other):
        """Returns True if this Course conflicts with `other`, False otherwise.
        It is not a conflict if one course ends when the other begins.
        Precondition: `other` is a Course object.
  </snippet-file>
 </snippet>
 <p>
  It states "It is not a conflict if one course ends when the other begins. Precondition:
  <code>
   other
  </code>
  is a Course object." So to answer your question, it is not a conflict.
 </p>
 <p>
  Best,
 </p>
 <p>
  Troy
