 I was doing lab 11 and I have a question about methods for strings/lists etc.
</p>
<p>
 Most methods we have used (e.g. len() etc.) return something and you can assign what is returned to a variable. The reverse() and sort() methods used in the lab didn't, and I got an error when trying to assign them to a variable, e.g. when I tried to do this: x = output.reverse(), where output is a list.
</p>
<p>
 I'm a bit confused about how to tell when methods return something and when they don't. I worked out what was wrong but it took a while -- is it just a matter of remembering/looking it up?
</p>
<p>
 Thanks!
</p>

  If you take a look at the
  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/tutorial/datastructures.html?highlight=list">
   Python documentation for lists
  </a>
  , you'll see that methods that return something will explicitly say "return" somewhere in the specification. Additionally, sometimes you'll see that methods say they modify the list "in place," which means they just modify the list, but not return it.

   Okay thanks! So it's just a case of knowing / looking it up?
