 <blockquote>
  Whether in-person or online, Prelim 1 is proctored and closed-book. Because online exam takers cannot ask questions during the exam, at the in-person exam we also will not answer individual questions other than to say "please use your best judgment." However, if we determine that we need to make an important clarification, then we will make an announcement to both the in-person and online exam sessions.
 </blockquote>
 <blockquote>
  Due to time zone differences and exam conflicts, a small number of students will take their Prelim 1 later than the University-scheduled time of Tues 6:30-8pm. Therefore,
  <b>
   after taking the exam, do not discuss your exam with anyone
  </b>
  (other than course staff).

  In-person Exam

  Please check the seating charts (

  <i>
   before going to the exam site
  </i>
  so that you can move through the doorways quickly to allow everyone to enter without too much crowding.
  <b>
   Exam takers in Barton Hall must use their
   <i>
    assigned entrance
   </i>
   to get to their assigned seat.
  </b>
  (If you need a wheelchair accessible entrance, please use the accessible entrance on the east side of the building.)
  <b>
   Please
   <i>
    do not
   </i>
   crowd around the doors--maintain a distance of 6 feet from others at all time, and queue outside instead of crowding around the doors if the entry process is slow. If you can, arrive in the early part of the 6:00-6:25pm window to avoid the busiest time.
  </b>
  Everyone should be seated by 6:25pm for an on-time start at 6:30pm. Thanks for your cooperation! Please note the following:

 <list style="unordered">
  <li>
   <blockquote>
    Bring your Cornell ID card (or other official ID that has a picture and your name on it) and place it on your table once you're seated.

   <blockquote>
    Bring a simple watch (or even a clock) if you have one. There is no easy way to tell time at Barton. You are

    Bring extra pencils (or pens) and an eraser. Do not use your own paper--you must write entirely in the exam packet.

    To submit your exam
    <i>
     prior to the end of the exam period

    , you can give your exam to a proctor and then leave
    <i>
     quietly
    </i>
    through the entrance from which you entered the exam space. Once the end of the exam is announced, however, please
    <b>
     stop writing and stay in your seat
    </b>
    until a proctor comes to you to collect your exam. Once the proctor has taken your exam then you can leave through the entrance from which you entered.
    <i>
     We need to do this to prevent crowding around any collection point, along the aisles, and at doorways.
    </i>
    Thanks, again, for your cooperation!

  Online Exam
 </blockquote>
 <blockquote>
  Be sure to join the exam session at least 20 minutes before the exam start-time using the 2-device set up that has been checked by a proctor at your mock exam session. (The proctor will remove any students who have not done a mock exam from the actual exam session so that the actual exam will not be delayed or otherwise negatively impacted.) We recommend that you review the

   Hi, but this announcement doesn't specify the zoom link that we should be using though. Do we use the same link as the mock?
