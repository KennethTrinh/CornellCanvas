 Is the regrade request due 24 hours after the grades are realized, or do we follow the deadline of March 20th on CMS?

  You can submit multiple regrade requests so itâ€™s not only one due 24 hours after, so follow the March 20th deadline!

  Nevertheless, we strongly recommend that you submit regrades within 24 hours of every time you get feedback back, in order to allow for as many resubmissions as possible until you get a perfect score.
