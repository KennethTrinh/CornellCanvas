  Hello! My partner and I were able to fix our code but we are unsure of what is meant to be print when running function Showdown Object.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For us, we get:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Cornell_U vs. Harvard_U Number of students accepted at both: 12 Number of such students who enrolled at one of them: 10 % who chose Cornell_U over Harvard_U: 10.0 % who chose Harvard_U over Cornell_U: 90.0
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  But we do not get the FYI part printed out:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  FYI, here is the internal showdown data Cornell_U vs. Harvard_U accepted at both: 383,404,453,548,888,1464,1731,1896,1902,1952,2665,1903 accepted at both, enrolled at Cornell_U: 1903 accepted at both, enrolled at Harvard_U: 383,404,453,548,888,1731,1902,1952,2665

   Overall Question: Is the FYI internal data meant to be printed out or not when running showdown function?
