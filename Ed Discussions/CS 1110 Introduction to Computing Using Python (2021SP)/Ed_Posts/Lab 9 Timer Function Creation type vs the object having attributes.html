  I am confused when trying to create a function for timer in lab 9. How do you set hours and minutes to a variable? When I do, I get the error, "type object 'Timer' has no attribute 'hours'", but I thought Timer does have the attribute hours..

  Hi, this is a good question!

  It is can often be confusing for beginning students to distinguish between types vs objects of that type.  I've struggled for a useful analogy for years now, and here's my current working example:
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  Think of a "type" or "class" as an abstract concept or definition, like
  <italic>
   homo sapiens.
  </italic>
  (We're getting all fancy with the Latin here precisely to make the class seem abstract and divorced from normal life.)
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  You and I are specific objects, or instantiations, of the type
  <italic>
   homo sapiens.
  </italic>
  <break>
  </break>
  You and I have attributes with values, like the color of our hair (mine is black/greying).
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  But
  <italic>
   homo sapiens
  </italic>
  isn't a physical thing in our universe, and doesn't have a specific hair color.  Rather,
  <italic>
   homo sapiens
  </italic>
  is a definition that implies that everything that is an object of type
  <italic>
   homo sapiens
  </italic>
  has hair.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  Analogously, the class Timer is a type (
  <italic>
   tempus fugit,
  </italic>
  say). Every object that is a timer has an attribute hours, with some value.  But the class Timer itself is just a definition that makes "hours" a required characteristic of objects of its type.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  ......
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  all of this is a long way of saying: you need/should be handling an object of class Timer, not trying to access attributes of the type/definition itself.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  Example:
  <break>
  </break>
 </paragraph>
 <pre>t = Timer(3,14)

print(t.hours)   # this works

print(Timer.hours) # this gives error: type object 'Timer' has no attribute 'hours'
</pre>
