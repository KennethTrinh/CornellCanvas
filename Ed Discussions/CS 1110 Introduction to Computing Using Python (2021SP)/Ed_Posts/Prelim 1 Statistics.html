  I recall some previous Prelim 1 examples showed exam statistics (mean, median, etc) on the first page of solution keys.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Would such statistics be released this semester also?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I do understand you do not use absolute cutoffs/boundaries for individual exams. But, I was curious how I did compared to the class, and was wondering whether the class perceived the exam to be difficult or not. Thank you.

  We don't release such statistics.

  As one wise staff member said some time ago, "if you release the mean/median, it tends to make at least 50% of the class feel bad, even if the mean was a perfectly good performance".
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  And, we do not want students to feel that their performance is measured relative to that of other students, or that they are in competition with each other, because it isn't and they aren't!
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  So, please just use the grade-center information to see how well we think you are doing on this material!

  In case it's useful to repeat the grade-center info from the
  <link href="https://canvas.cornell.edu/courses/25213/discussion_topics/254837"/>
  Canvas announcement Prof. Fan made earlier:

 <blockquote>
  We do not use absolute cutoffs for grade-levels, so as to adjust for the difficulty of individual homeworks and exams. Rather, here is how you can determine our letter-grade assessment of your work.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  For Prelim 1, out of 88 points,
  <break>
  </break>
  the rough center of the A grades is 83;
  <break>
  </break>
  the rough center of the Bs is 75;
  <break>
  </break>
  the rough center of the Cs is 65;
  <break>
  </break>
  a 49 or below should be considered definitely
  <italic>
   below
  </italic>
  a C- (recall that for S/U grading, U = below a C-)
  <break>
  </break>
  We don't determine grade boundaries for individual exams.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  So, for example, scores of 73 or 77 are definitely some flavor of B (B+/B/B-), and we are not determining whether a score like 79 is a B-like grade or an A-like grade.
