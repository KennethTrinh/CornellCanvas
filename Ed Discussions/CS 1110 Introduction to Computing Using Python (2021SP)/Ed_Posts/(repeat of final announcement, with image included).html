 1. We have uploaded course grades to Student Center, and as a courtesy, to CMS so that you can see them earlier. The grades will be viewable on Student Center by 5:30pm Ithaca time, according to the Registrar's website. Please note that our policy is to not publish exact grade cutoffs, and we do not negotiate grades.
</p>
<p>
 2. The URL https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs1110/ will switch over to future instances of CS1110; but the Spring 2021 materials (except for the labs) will be retained at https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs1110/2021sp.
</p>
<p>
 3. Use the address cs1110-prof@cornell.edu for course communication until June 3rd; at which date control of that email address will pass on to the summer CS1110 instructor.

 4. We'd like to take this opportunity to crow about the CS1110 course staff. This semester, we had an UNBELIEVABLY great team! And the following staff members won teaching awards from the Computer Science Department!
</p>
<p>
 Graduate students: Rachel Brotherton, Hannah Lee, Priya Malla, Shriya Nagpal, Brynn Szczesniak
</p>
<p>
 Undergraduate students: Dylan Castillo, Jonathan Chai, Kevin Cook, Aliva Das, Elizabeth Finkel, Jude Javillo, Linda Nduhiu

 Remember back to the first day of class when we said you were in good hands? We weren't kidding!
</p>
<p>
 5. It was a pleasure to share a small part of your academic journey with you. Even if you never program again, we hope you found this new way of thinking that we've introduced you to illuminating; and we also hope you'll feel empowered to
 <i>
  do
 </i>
 more programming to solve some problems or even just reduce some tedium you encounter in your real life. Drop us a line at DFAN@cs.cornell.edu and/or LLEE@cs.cornell.edu to let us know how it goes!
</p>
<p>
 We leave you with a farewell image: a piece of art by TA Priya Malla, done in 2016. May
 <i>
  your
 </i>
 dreams take you wherever you desire!
