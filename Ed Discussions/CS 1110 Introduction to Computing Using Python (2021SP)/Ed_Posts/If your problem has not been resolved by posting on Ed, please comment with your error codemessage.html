  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I see that there are 3 times more people on Ed than usual, so I would like to provide help to those still stuck on an error code.  I am not sure if I have time to answer every comment or question today because I need to do my math homework and it is my mom's birthday, but I will try my best.

  Best,

  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I believe you have incorrectly coded the super class add method function.  you should be appending each class to the in_schedule attributes of the course argument.  Then in the student schedule method function, you should be calling the add superclass method function with super()

  Could you please make a separate post, not a reply to this one, with a suitable title? That will make it much easier for other students to find posts that are relevant to them, and also make it clear what has been answered and what hasn't.

  We can also mark posts as duplicates to point students to the right direction, but we can't do that with replies.

  Hi!
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  The first schedule is the roster, right? So, you should only be appending time change warning to the roster.
