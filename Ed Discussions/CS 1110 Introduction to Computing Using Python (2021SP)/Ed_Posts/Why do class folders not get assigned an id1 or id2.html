 In 2018 Spring Q1, the solution has this drawn. I'm just a little unsure why objects get "id1" in global space, but classes just go down as "A" or "B".

<p>
 Also, in 2019 Spring Q2, the class folders' "A" and "B" are not represented in the global space

  at all,

 though here they appear to be. Is there any convention?

  We haven't introduced too formal a notation for class folders (as opposed to call frames, where we do have strict rules).

   Don't sweat the details of how class folders are drawn --- just make whatever necessary information is clear/helps you solve a question.

   you DO have to follow our notation rules for regular object folders and for call frames.

  All semesters are trying to make some distinction between "regular" object folders and class folders --- while classes are actually objects themselves (!), being too pedantic on that point tends to confuse issues more than clarify them.  So, in the drawing above, the class folders don't have IDs on them to make them look more different than object folders.

  For the 2018 Spring question, remember that students weren't asked to draw the folders --- I included the diagram just to explain where the actual numbers (the printouts) were coming from.  It makes sense to draw the class folders because there are questions about the class variables named
  <code>
   x
  </code>
  , so we drew the class folders so you could see where those class attributes are.
