  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  This error occurs in my getTime when I call the method in my changeTime. I understand that the error means the value in the bracket is "W", which could not be converted into an integer. But my getTime method passes all test cases so this shouldn't be happening. Can you please explain more to me?

  <italic>
   ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'W'

  Thank you!

  Hi, can you post the entire error message, not just the last line? (It's OK that we'll get tiny snippets of  your code)

  Hi Professor,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Here's the entire error message. Thanks for helping!
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I try printing self.getTime() before any coding in changeTime() and the result is "TBA". But when I try to call getTime() again to write the warning message, the error occurs.

  OK, looking at the testing code for
  <code>
   test_course_changetime
  </code>
  , we see the following lines that are resulting in the error you see:
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
 </paragraph>
 <snippet language="py" line-numbers="true" runnable="false">
  <snippet-file id="code">
   initial_courses_to_add = roster_creation.make_initial_course_list()
    roster = roster_creation.make_sample_roster(initial_courses_to_add)
    my_schedule = StudentSchedule("My Plan C")

    arch1120 = roster.courses["ARCH 1120 STU 520"] # a TBA course

    test_courses = [roster.courses["CS 1110 LEC 001"],
                    roster.courses["AEP 3560 LEC 001"],
                    roster.courses["FAKER 0000 LEC 002"],
                    arch1120]             
    for c in test_courses:
        my_schedule.add(c)

    new_time = "MWF 8:00am-8:00pm"
    arch1120.changeTime(new_time)

    assert arch1120.getTime() == new_time, \
        _assert_msg("Time of ARCH 1120", new_time, arch1120.getTime())
  </snippet-file>
 </snippet>
 <paragraph>
  Now, line 18 is checking whether line 16 caused the time of arch1120 to change correctly.
  <break>
  </break>
  So, it seems that arch1120.changeTime(new_time) is doing something unexpected to the Course arch1120 such that the getTime no longer works.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  So, time to debug changeTime to figure out what it is doing to its
  <code>
   self
  </code>
  that isn't going right --- i.e., is changing things in a way so that the getTime method no longer works!
  <break>
  </break>

  Hi Professor,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thanks for the explanation! I now realize that the getTime() is no longer working possibly due to a change in the
  <italic>
   self.
  </italic>
  But what I've been doing in my coding was just calling
  <italic>
   self.getTime()
  </italic>
  and I couldn't find out when did the
  <italic>
   self
  </italic>
  change. Can you please tell me that in what situation is the
  <italic>
   self
  </italic>
  likely to be replaced?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thank you!

  Note that changeTime() (not getTime, but changeTime)
  <italic>
   should
  </italic>
  be changing attributes of self, because its purpose is to change the time of its "embedding" object (a Course).
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  Whatever changetime is doing is altering whatever getTime will
  <italic>
   later
  </italic>
  pull its information from.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  So, changeTime is supposed to change its self object, but it is not doing so correctly ---- according to the error message, the variable
  <code>
   starthour
  </code>
  is a string 'W', so seems like changeTime is altering wrongly whatever is the information that
  <code>
   starthour
  </code>
  is coming from.
