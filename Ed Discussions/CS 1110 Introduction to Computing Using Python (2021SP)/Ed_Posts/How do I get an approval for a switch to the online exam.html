  We are trying to understand the university process here --- it seems that different colleges might be handling things differently? --- , but here is what is posted on the student FAQ by the university,

  What are the rules surrounding exams and finals during the spring semester? Can I take my exams from anywhere?
 </heading>
 <blockquote>
  If you are enrolled in a course that is giving an in-person exam or final and you are registered as being in the Ithaca area, you will be expected to take your exam in person. Any class – regardless of its instruction mode – can give an in-person exam. Therefore, even if you are enrolled in all online courses, it is possible that you could have in-person exams and finals and will be expected to take them in person, here in Ithaca. For planning purposes, faculty are provided with information about which of their students are registered as being in Ithaca and therefore available to take exams in person.
 </blockquote>
 <blockquote>
  <bold>
   Students are not permitted to leave early or engage in non-essential travel that would necessitate quarantine that would make it impossible for them to take their exam(s) in person. Students should not expect to be able to take in-person exams remotely.

  Along with this, when should we expect to get a reply to our regrade request to make sure that everything is approved?

  We're caught right now in trying to navigate some policies.  We have active inquiries out but have to wait for responses from various parties that are pretty overburdened now.  I'm afraid I can't promise a timeline right now on decisions, but we are trying hard to get the open questions resolved.

  Remember also that alternate exam arrangements require us to find proctors, schedule mock exams, and so on, and staff availability is limited.
