 I will be taking the prelim online. When can I expect to receive an email from my proctor? I haven't been contacted yet?
</p>
<p>
 Thanks!

  It is good you posted this to Ed Discussions - one other person saw this and realized they were in the same situation!

  Mail cs1110-prof@cornell.edu, cc: ahf42@cornell.edu, immediately,
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  (1) explaining why you did not receive/understand the information sent by CMS email, canvas announcement, and lecture
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  (2) explaining what your time zone is
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  (3) list your free times for today and tomorrow (in Ithaca time)
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  ...and we will try to figure out how to fit a mock exam session in for you.
 </p>

   I do understand that there is a lot of information being broadcast in this class, and I'm sure in other classes that you're involved in, too; and not being in Ithaca can make it hard to keep up.
   <break>
   </break>
   <break>
   </break>
   I do want to make sure that you have
   <i>
    access
   </i>
   to the CMS emails (i.e., are checking spam filters), Canvas announcements, and lecture slides, though.  If there aren't connectivity issues, we are doing everything we can to get information to students.

   We have no record of you requesting an online exam on your CMS alt time/format request "assignment", I'm afraid.
   <break>
   </break>
   <break>
   </break>
   And I also see that you were on our Mar 17 list of students emailed,
   <break>
   </break>
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   "The deadline for requesting an alternate time/format for the CS 1110 in-person prelim on Mar 30 6:30pm Ithaca time has closed.  If you missed the deadline but need extra time/to take the prelim online/to take the prelim at a different time, we will consider late requests submitted by Thursday 3/18 at 11:59pm and will do our best to try to make arrangements."
  </blockquote>
  <p>
   Also, for the record, the original canvas announcement and lecture announcement said:
   <break>
   </break>
   <break>
   </break>
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   "If you need an alternate time, extended time and/or an online version of Prelim 1, Tue Mar 30th 6:30-8pm Ithaca time, please fill out
   <i>
    two
   </i>
   CMS assignments, parts A and B of "Prelim 1 alternate time/format request". ...
   <b>
    People who will not be in the Ithaca area should also submit them
   </b>
   ."
  </blockquote>
  <p>
   <break>
   </break>
   <break>
   </break>
   Lecture 10 slides:
   <break>
   </break>
   <break>
   </break>
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   Only
   <b>
    if you cannot write Prelim 1 in person
   </b>
   on Mar 30 at 6:30pm Ithaca time or have SDS exam accommodations, do the CMS “assignment” called “Prelim 1 alternate format/time request” (both Parts A &amp; B). Request deadline is Mar 16 11:59pm. Legitimate reasons needed to request online format and/or alternative time  Conflicting exam listed on University Evening Prelim Schedule 
   <b>
    You are not in Ithaca
   </b>
