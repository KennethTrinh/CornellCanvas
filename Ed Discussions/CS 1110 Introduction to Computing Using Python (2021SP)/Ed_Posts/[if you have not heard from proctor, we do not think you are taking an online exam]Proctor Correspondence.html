  I will be taking the prelim online. When can I expect to receive an email from my proctor? I haven't been contacted yet?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thanks!

  It is good you posted this to Ed Discussions - one other person saw this and realized they were in the same situation!

  We have no record of you requesting an online exam on your CMS alt time/format request "assignment", I'm afraid.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  And I also see that you were on our Mar 17 list of students emailed,
  <break>
  </break>
 </paragraph>
 <blockquote>
  "The deadline for requesting an alternate time/format for the CS 1110 in-person prelim on Mar 30 6:30pm Ithaca time has closed.  If you missed the deadline but need extra time/to take the prelim online/to take the prelim at a different time, we will consider late requests submitted by Thursday 3/18 at 11:59pm and will do our best to try to make arrangements."
 </blockquote>
 <paragraph>
  Also, for the record, the original canvas announcement and lecture announcement said:
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
 </paragraph>
 <blockquote>
  "If you need an alternate time, extended time and/or an online version of Prelim 1, Tue Mar 30th 6:30-8pm Ithaca time, please fill out
  <italic>
   two
  </italic>
  CMS assignments, parts A and B of "Prelim 1 alternate time/format request". ...
  <bold>
   People who will not be in the Ithaca area should also submit them
  </bold>
  ."
 </blockquote>
 <paragraph>
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  Lecture 10 slides:
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
 </paragraph>
 <blockquote>
  Only
  <bold>
   if you cannot write Prelim 1 in person
  </bold>
  on Mar 30 at 6:30pm Ithaca time or have SDS exam accommodations, do the CMS “assignment” called “Prelim 1 alternate format/time request” (both Parts A &amp; B). Request deadline is Mar 16 11:59pm. Legitimate reasons needed to request online format and/or alternative time  Conflicting exam listed on University Evening Prelim Schedule 
  <bold>
   You are not in Ithaca

  Mail cs1110-prof@cornell.edu, cc: ahf42@cornell.edu, immediately,
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  (1) explaining why you did not receive/understand the information sent by CMS email, canvas announcement, and lecture
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  (2) explaining what your time zone is
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  (3) list your free times for today and tomorrow (in Ithaca time)
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  ...and we will try to figure out how to fit a mock exam session in for you.

  I do understand that there is a lot of information being broadcast in this class, and I'm sure in other classes that you're involved in, too; and not being in Ithaca can make it hard to keep up.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  I do want to make sure that you have
  <italic>
   access
  </italic>
  to the CMS emails (i.e., are checking spam filters), Canvas announcements, and lecture slides, though.  If there aren't connectivity issues, we are doing everything we can to get information to students.
