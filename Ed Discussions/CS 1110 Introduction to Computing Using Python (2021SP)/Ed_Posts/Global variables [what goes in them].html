 Since we aren't supposed to make folders for objects, what should I put inside the global variables instead of the id numbers? I think we can put variable names for some of the ones that repeat but I am confused what to put for bsg and fs.

  Ah: it isn't true that you aren't supposed to make folders for objects.

  You aren't supposed to make folders for "imported modules or function definitions", according to Section 6 item 7.  But for other objects, you should be indicating them as folders.

  Please take a look at and try out some of the material mentioned in the handout under section 2, "Worked Examples"; the directions for those examples are in essence the same for your current A1.

   Okay, thank you! Sorry for being repetitive, that statement threw me off but to clarify, when you call a function from an import, you still create the folders?

    No worries!

    But no, when you call a function from an import, you don't create the folder. (You do create the
    <i>
     call frame
    </i>
    for the function call.
    <break>
    </break>
    <break>
    </break>
    Call frames are the things with a box in the upper left and right corners.  Folders are the things with a tab sticking up out of the upper left corner.
    <break>
    </break>
    )
   </p>
   <p>
    Do consult the worked examples --- going through them and looking at the solutions we provided will make this all much clearer, I think!
