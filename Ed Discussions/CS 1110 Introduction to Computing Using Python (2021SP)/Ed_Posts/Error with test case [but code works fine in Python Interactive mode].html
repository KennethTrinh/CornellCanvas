 We are having an issue with changeTime when the initial time was TBA. When we test our code in regular python is appears to successfully change the time. However, running the test code does not result in the same conclusion- nothing changes. Why is this happening?

  Let's see.  How do you know whether in regular python the time is successfully changed?  Are you looking at what getTime returns, or printing the values of various attributes/method calls?

   We were changing the variables using our code and then printing the variables, and they were printing out the correctly changed terms

    Just to see if I understand what's happening:
    <break>
    </break>
    <break>
    </break>
    In regular Python (= python interactive mode?), are you simulating what the test case does?
    <break>
    </break>
   </p>
   <snippet language="py" line-numbers="true" runnable="false">
    <snippet-file id="code">
     # do the right imports first!

arch1120 = Course("ARCH1120", "TBA") # too lazy to enter the whole name
arch1120.changeTime("MWF 8:00am-8:00pm")
print(arch1120.getTime())
    </snippet-file>
   </snippet>
   <p>
    and you get "MWF 8:00am-8:00pm" printed out?
    <break>
    </break>
    And when you print your variables (I don't know what they are and don't post 'em here), they do indicate that the time has really changed?
    <break>
    </break>
    <break>
    </break>
