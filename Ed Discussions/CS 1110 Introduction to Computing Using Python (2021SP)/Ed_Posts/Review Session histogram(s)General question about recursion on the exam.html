  Put in your question title the year, semester, and question.  Ideal would also be to include the topic.   Example: 2018SP Q2(b) - call frames

  Include a screenshot of the question, so readers/answerers don't have to go find the relevant

  This is the way I wrote histogram(s):

  Technically it uses recursion, but it's the same idea as just using a for-loop since it can easily be rewritten like this:

  Would my original answer get points taken off since it's basically just a for-loop?

  You are right that this is not what we want, because indeed the recursion is basically on being used on its base cases.  So, when a question says that your answer needs to be
  <italic>
   fundamentally
  </italic>
  recursive or
  <italic>
   at heart recursive
  </italic>
  or
  <italic>
   makes effective use of recursion,
  </italic>
  you would not get credit for a solution as above.
