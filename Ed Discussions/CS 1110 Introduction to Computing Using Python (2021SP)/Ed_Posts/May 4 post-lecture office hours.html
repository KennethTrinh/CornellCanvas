  How to access attributes of an object that's a value in a dictionary?
 </p>

   About A5 Q2: "" Is there any function in sd_utilities_list.py that would be better to convert to a method of class Showdown or College?"  How to think about this?

    So what's the diff?
    <break>
    </break>
    1. how you write them (indented in a class or not, whether you have the self parameter)
   </p>
   <p>
    2. how a user calls them.
    <break>
    </break>
    Example:
    <code>
     len
    </code>
    is a non-method function.  Call via
    <code>
     len(" abc ")
    </code>
    <break>
    </break>
    <code>
     strip()
    </code>
    is a method.  Call as
    <code>
     "  abc  ".strip()
    </code>
   </p>
   <snippet language="py" line-numbers="true" runnable="true">
    <snippet-file id="code">
     x = 5
print(len(x)) # x doesn't have a length, no type-checking of the arugment
    </snippet-file>
   </snippet>
   <p>
    Method only exists for the type it's defined for.
    <break>
    </break>
    <break>
    </break>
    "semantics" looks nice.
    <break>
    </break>
    If eat were a non-method function: call would be like
    <code>
     eat(&lt;animal&gt;, &lt;grass&gt;)
    </code>
    .
    <break>
    </break>
    If it were a method: it would be
    <code>
     &lt;animal&gt;.eat(&lt;grass&gt;)
    </code>
    , which is arguably more sensible --- one is the actor and one is the input.
   </p>

    <p>
     Contrariwise, a function should probably not be a method if:
     <break>
     </break>
     <break>
     </break>
     (a) it doesn't have any special "association" with a particular object.  Like,
     <code>
      len()
     </code>
     can work on both strings and lists, so it's hard to see why one would define it as a method of strings and a method of lists.
     <break>
     </break>
    </p>
    <p>
     (b) none of its arguments would have a special "actor" or "subject" status.
     <break>
     </break>
    </p>

   <pre># menu_listing has a for-loop: can we keep it?
# Answer: yes!

def menu_listing(colleges):
    """Returns: string of numbered names of the colleges in `colleges`, starting
    with 0.  
    
    Format for each college:  '0: Whatsamatta_U' 
    (so, colon after number, then 1 space.)

    The numbered-name items are separated by a tab (\t).

    Example: for the list colleges_from_file('small_test1.txt'), the output
    is
        '0: B\t1: A\t2: D\t3: E'
    which prints out as
        0: B    1: A    2: D    3: E

    There is no newline ('\n') or whitespace at the end of the returned string.

    Precondition: `colleges` is a dictionary of Colleges (possibly empty.)
    """

     Q1: what's a non-hashable object?.
     <break>
     </break>
     A1:  For dictionaries, rule -of-thumb is that the
     <i>
      keys
     </i>
     should be strings or ints, not lists or arbitrary objects.
     <break>
     </break>
     <break>
     </break>
     Q2: how to create a dictionary entry with an empty list as value?
    </p>
    <p>
     A2: see line 4 below.
    </p>
    <snippet language="py" line-numbers="true" runnable="true">
     <snippet-file id="code">
      mydict = {}
mydict["awesome"] = "Kenny"
# mydict[["here", "is", "a", "list"]] = "yep" # &lt;-- causes an error
mydict["whatever key, say it's a college name"] = []
print("success if you see this line!")
     </snippet-file>
    </snippet>
    <p>
     If you tried to make a College as a key in dictionary, you'll get this error.
