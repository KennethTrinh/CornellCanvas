  Q1: what's a non-hashable object?.
  <break>
  </break>
  A1:  For dictionaries, rule -of-thumb is that the
  <italic>
   keys
  </italic>
  should be strings or ints, not lists or arbitrary objects.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  Q2: how to create a dictionary entry with an empty list as value?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  A2: see line 4 below.

mydict["awesome"] = "Kenny"

mydict["whatever key, say it's a college name"] = []
print("success if you see this line!")

 <paragraph>
  If you tried to make a College as a key in dictionary, you'll get this error.

 <pre># menu_listing has a for-loop: can we keep it?
# Answer: yes!

def menu_listing(colleges):
    """Returns: string of numbered names of the colleges in `colleges`, starting
    with 0.  
    
    Format for each college:  '0: Whatsamatta_U' 
    (so, colon after number, then 1 space.)

    The numbered-name items are separated by a tab (\t).

    Example: for the list colleges_from_file('small_test1.txt'), the output
    is
        '0: B\t1: A\t2: D\t3: E'
    which prints out as
        0: B    1: A    2: D    3: E

    There is no newline ('\n') or whitespace at the end of the returned string.

    Precondition: `colleges` is a dictionary of Colleges (possibly empty.)
    """

  So what's the diff?
  <break>
  </break>
  1. how you write them (indented in a class or not, whether you have the self parameter)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  2. how a user calls them.
  <break>
  </break>
  Example:
  <code>
   len
  </code>
  is a non-method function.  Call via
  <code>
   len(" abc ")
  </code>
  <break>
  </break>
  <code>
   strip()
  </code>
  is a method.  Call as
  <code>
   "  abc  ".strip()
  </code>
 </paragraph>
 <snippet language="py" line-numbers="true" runnable="true">
  <snippet-file id="code">
   x = 5
print(len(x)) # x doesn't have a length, no type-checking of the arugment
  </snippet-file>
 </snippet>
 <paragraph>
  Method only exists for the type it's defined for.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  "semantics" looks nice.
  <break>
  </break>
  If eat were a non-method function: call would be like
  <code>
   eat(&lt;animal&gt;, &lt;grass&gt;)
  </code>
  .
  <break>
  </break>
  If it were a method: it would be
  <code>
   &lt;animal&gt;.eat(&lt;grass&gt;)
  </code>
  , which is arguably more sensible --- one is the actor and one is the input.

  Contrariwise, a function should probably not be a method if:
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  (a) it doesn't have any special "association" with a particular object.  Like,
  <code>
   len()
  </code>
  can work on both strings and lists, so it's hard to see why one would define it as a method of strings and a method of lists.
  <break>
  </break>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  (b) none of its arguments would have a special "actor" or "subject" status.
