  Hello! This question has been asked before but I'm still very unclear on how to fix this. I've visualized testing the code on Python tutor and the return value is None. So I don't know if the problem is in cornellasserts or if there's something I need to do to make this work. Thanks!

  Line 122 in the helper_tests.py file is testing valid names, so your function should not be returning None. It should be returning a College object.

  Oh sorry, I think I'm actually confused about the purpose of this function. Is it supposed to return the string n (where n is the name of the college) if n is in clist? Or is it supposed to return something else?

  It's supposed to return a College object in the list 'clist' that has a name 'n'. If there are no College objects in the list with such a name, then your function returns None.
