<callout type="info">
 Put in your question title the year, semester, and question.  Ideal would also be to include the topic.   Example: 2018SP Q2(b) - call frames
</callout>
<callout type="info">
 Include a screenshot of the question, so readers/answerers don't have to go find the relevant pdf.

 When I tried to run this, it prints None as well, is that okay? I was testing my code and it wasn't returning the same output but then I realized my code was the same as the solution. So I wanted to check. Thank you

  Hm. There shouldn't be a print of None before count_from shouldn't ever be None.

  I can't reproduce what you are seeing --- try hitting "run" in the box below.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  You can make a runnable example by pressing the "&lt;&gt;" button that's near the "globe" icon to get a box like below.  Can you post a followup including your code in such a "run box"?

 <snippet language="py" line-numbers="true" runnable="true">
  <snippet-file id="code">
   def f(x,y):
    while x &gt;= 0:
        print(x)
        x -= y
f(16, 5)
print("...")
f(21, 7)
  </snippet-file>

   I think I realized my mistake after seeing your code. I wrote print(f(16, 5) instead of f(16,5). When I changed that it fixed it. But I am still unsure why it prints None.

    Ah!  Because f(16,5) returns None! (since it doesn't have a return statement)
    <break>
    </break>
    So, print(f(16,5)) is equivalent to print(None), and Python does what you tell it (which isn't always what you meant!)
