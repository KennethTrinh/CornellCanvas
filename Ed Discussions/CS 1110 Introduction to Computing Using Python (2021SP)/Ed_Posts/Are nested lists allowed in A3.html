 Since they were in the same lecture as dictionaries but not explicitly prohibited, I'm not sure.

  They are allowed, but all the list attributes of the College and Showdown objects should not be nested lists (since their specifications do not allow them).

   (The reason we view nested lists as OK and dictionaries as not OK for A3 is that lists as introduced before this week could
   <i>
    always
   </i>
   be nested.)
