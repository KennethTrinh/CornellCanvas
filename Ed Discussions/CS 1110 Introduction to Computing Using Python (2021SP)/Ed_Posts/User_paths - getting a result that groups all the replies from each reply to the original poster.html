  For user_paths, I set up a diagnostic print statement and for the main example I get the result ['A, B, C, B, B, A, A', 'A, D, B, D, A, D, E, A, F, A, G, A, D, A, D, A, D, B'], so instead of grouping together each individual path, I am instead just grouping the two reply chains from the original poster. Does anybody have any advice on how to set up my for loop differently or otherwise indicate when a path is finalized within the for loop so that I can separate the paths? I've been working on this for a while and I'm not making much progress.

  Good job with the print statement!

  What it suggests to me is, you are getting some strings kind of "joined up" that should be separate, so I suspect you might have been using
  <code>
   join
  </code>
  on not-quite-the-right-things.
