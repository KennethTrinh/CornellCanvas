 Hello, everyone! I have a quick question about the call frame diagraming question in the final from Spring 2019. I understand how to draw the call frames, but I have a question about variable count in the second Person.count call frame. I have pointed to it below, and it shows 1 crossed out to write another 1. In the code, line 29 shows that count += self.parent.count(name), so I understand why the cross-out is there (you are essentially adding 0, so 1+0 = 1). However, is this necessary? I do not remember if we did this before, but if the value of a variable is "changing" (like you are adding 0) but with no "value change," do we still need to cross out the old value to write it again (as is shown in the example below)? I do not remember if we did this before. Any help you could give would be much appreciated. Thank you!

  We will not care whether you "cross off" a value and replace it with the same value, or not!  We only care that the diagrams represent the actual state of memory/call stack at each relevant time.
