  I recently just joined the class and saw in Lecture recordings that there will be clicker/poll questions during lecture. I was wondering what is used to conduct these polls and such.

  Hi, just zoom-based polling, with no affect on student grades - we're not taking attendance or anything like that. The questions during lecture are solely for students' educational benefit.
