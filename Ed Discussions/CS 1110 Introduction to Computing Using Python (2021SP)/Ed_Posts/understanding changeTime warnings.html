  I am having trouble understanding what the instructions want me to do. Basically I should add the "time change" warning to the warning list in schedules and studentschedules?  And then if it is the case that the time change creates a conflict with a course in studentschedule then I should add the "conflict warning" to the warning list in studentschedule?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I feel like I am overthinking this and am confused on what it wants me to do.

  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  You should only be appending the time change wanting to the roster (aka schedule super class).
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Then, you should be appending BOTH the time change warning and the conflict warnings for each student schedule.

  Best,
