  I believe no date has been set yet. It should be in the Spring Exam Schedule provided by Cornell once the exam schedule is released

   (More behind-the-scenes insight; instructors have no control over when final exams are scheduled, and the People Who Plan are waiting for the end of add/drop so as to have finalized classlists --- with the finalized classlists, said People will be able to create a final exam schedule that minimizes actual exam conflicts for actual students' schedules.)
