  Would getting an error , "Keyerror :0" mean that my process_line function is wrong in utilities_dict, or that I need to change the menu_listing function? I haven't touched it but I see that function says "make whatever changes need to be made".

  Keyerror: 0 means that the program's trying to access some dictionary with a key "0", but the key value "0" doesn't exist in that dictionary. The earlier parts of the error message (ie the error traceback) tell you which line and which function the program is currently failing with such Keyerror, so you could use that to tell whether something is wrong in your menu_listing function or process_line, etc.
