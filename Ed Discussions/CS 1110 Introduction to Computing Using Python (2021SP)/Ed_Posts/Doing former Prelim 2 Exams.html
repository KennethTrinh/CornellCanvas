 I was looking through the study guide and noticed there is not a "recommendation" about which former Prelim 2 exams to look at. On the previous test, there was a section specifying which prelims would be most similar to ours.
</p>
<p>
 Looking at all 15 previous Prelim 2 exams overwhelms me... I'm not sure where to start. Are there any that you would recommend over the others? Should we focus on only the spring exams again?

  I think doing the more recent ones, where there is testing code you can practice on, is best, because you have that testing code to check your answers with.  Do use the study guide to know which problems to skip.
