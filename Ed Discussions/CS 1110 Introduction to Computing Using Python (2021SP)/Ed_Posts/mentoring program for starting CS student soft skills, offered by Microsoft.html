  Want a mentor in Tech? Whether you’re taking CS because you want to dip a toe in the tech waters or because you are fully committed to a tech journey, a new Microsoft mentoring program has been developed with you in mind. The goal is to provide additional support for starting CS students focusing on non-tech (soft) skills including problem solving, resilience, interpersonal skills, growth mindset, etc.

  During this program, Microsoft employees will serve as mentors, coaching your cohort of peers through group and individual remote sessions. You’ll work on developing individual and collaborative strategies to help navigate challenges that can arise across personal, academic and workspaces.
