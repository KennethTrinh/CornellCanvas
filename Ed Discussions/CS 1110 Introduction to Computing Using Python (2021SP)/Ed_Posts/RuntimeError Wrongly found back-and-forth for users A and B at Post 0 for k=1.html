 I'm getting:
</p>
<p>
 RuntimeError: Wrongly found back-and-forth for users A and B at Post 0 for k=1
</p>
<p>
 After all 17 or 18 other cases of k = 1 passed. Why would this one be any different? Does it have to do with the fact that Post 0 is the first post in the tree?
</p>

  I'd suggest using the my_own_private_testfn function technique described in section 7.1.3 to see exactly what your code is returning for the case of A and B at Post 0 for k=1, since your code is apparently returning something other than
  <code>
   False
  </code>
  .
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  (note: depending on where you put my_own_private_testfn(), you may need to say a4.bnf_starts_here instead of bnf_starts_here)
  <break>
  </break>
