 When I try to submit my code, the lab page keeps saying I’m submitting a function header and the unindented body. However, I didn’t copy any of the header. My code passed the test cases so I’m not sure why it’s not being accepted on the lab page.

  Our lab verifier is testing whether the word "pigify" shows up in the pasted-in text, as a rough-and-ready heuristic.  This time it was too rough and too ready!

  Edit your code so that the string "pigify" doesn't show up any where in it, with our apologies and regrets.
