  What does this error message mean? Isn't the keys in cdict the college name? Am I referring to the wrong key in dictionary?

  Hey!!!!
  <break>
  </break>
  I think you are receiving this error message because there is no key “Brown_U” in cdict, and you have to create a new college object with that name and then append it to cdict.  I could be wrong, however. Please let me know.
  <break>

  Best of luck!!

  Isn't that counterintuitive? The function process_line wants us to add the tag of sline to the appropriate list of each College in cdict. Shouldn't the function be able to work with any key in cdict?

  Some colleges in outcomes may not already be in cdict, as mentioned in the function specification for process_line.
