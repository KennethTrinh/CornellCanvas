  Super quick question regarding the pre-lecture material, was wondering if we should watch the videos and do the readings, or if we can do either/or.

  Hi, Prof Fan and I have been talking, and for the future we're going to ask that students don't directly ask lab questions in public forums, but rather try to rephrase their question as a different example.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  The idea is for you to have the learning experience you want, but to also allow other students to go through the lab experience without having seen the exact answer first.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  We'll work out a way for private/individual questions to be answered in office hours.
  <break>

  Question asker: You did nothing wrong given what we had told students at the time!
