  Just to make sure I'm understanding the assignment, we modify the function process_line() in both sd_utilities_list.py and sd_utilities_dict.py, but for showdown_time_a5.py, we should be using sd_utiliities_dict.py? And the only other functions we implement are college_named() and menu_list() in sd_utilities_dict.py?

  Hi!
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Yes to modifying function process_line()  in sd_utilities_list.py and sd_utilities_dict.py.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  For showdown_time_a5.py, you should try it both with sd_utilities_list
  <bold>
   and
  </bold>
  with sd_utilities_dict as the modules that showdown_time_a5.py imports, to see if they work.  When you submit it, have the import statement use sd_utilities_dict (but it won't actually matter to our autograder if we set things up correctly.)
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  For sd_utilities_dict.py,  the
  <bold>
   three
  </bold>
  functions you should implement are:
  <break>
  </break>
  * process_line()
  <break>
  </break>
  * college_named()
  <break>
  </break>
  * menu_listing()
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  ... and I just realized I forgot to mention menu_listing() in the handout --- will fix that pronto!
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  So
  <bold>
   thanks for asking,
  </bold>
  OP!!!

  By the way, one thing you're supposed to marvel at, in terms of the design of the code, is the fact that you can just swap module sd_utilities_dict.py for sd_utilities_list.py.  This is modular design!
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  In other words, the showdown functionality doesn't need to know how the showdown utilities are implemented, just how they are supposed to be called and what they are supposed to do.

  Although to be completely honest, this modularity does depend on the fact that the contents of variable
  <code>
   colleges
  </code>
  in the showdown_time code is never accessed directly, but just fed as an argument to the utility functions.
