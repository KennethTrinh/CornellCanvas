 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 While running my code against the provided a4 bnf_starts_here() tests, I noticed that the program crashed with the tag '0010.' It tells me that I missed a back-and-forth between A and B.
</p>
<p>
 According to the tree, 0010 is a leaf and has author A. So if it's a leaf, how can it have a back and forth if we start there?
</p>
<p>
 Here's a screenshot of my testing error:

<p>
 I can't put my code in for integrity reasons, but it passes my own tests. So I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong (this could just be a misunderstanding of the instructions, though).
</p>
<p>
 Thanks!
</p>

  Please see the definition of back-and-forths for k=1 in the handout, section 7.1.1 --- screenshot below (I can't convince Ed Discussions to put the image in the middle of this post; go figure (ha).)
