 Can we use  printf-style string formatting for this (the thing with the %)? I believe we've had it in class or in the pre-lecture videos a couple times. If not, are we supposed to get rid of the for-loop, or just implement it in the most natural way for dictionaries?

  You should keep the for-loop and implement your code in the most natural way for dictionaries.
