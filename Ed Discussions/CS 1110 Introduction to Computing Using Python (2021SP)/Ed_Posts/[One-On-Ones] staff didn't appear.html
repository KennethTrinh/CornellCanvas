  I am also having the issue where the TA didn't appear, and I checked on CMS I did sign up for this timeslot, I was wondering if I should go back to CMS and change my timeslot? Thank you!

  Can you contact the staff member you signed up for directly?  You should see their netid in CMS.  Please cc: cs1110-prof@cornell.edu when you do.
