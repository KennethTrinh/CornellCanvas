 Hi guys,
</p>
<p>
 I'm not sure what the policy is on questions about a specific part of the lab, so apologies in advance if this isn't an acceptable question.
</p>
<p>
 In section 1 of lab 5 there a question that asks what I think will be the output for change_hrs('9:04', 5) I thought it would be either (edit: answers) but none of those seem to be correct.
</p>
<p>
 Anybody know how change_hrs works?
</p>
<p>
 Liam

  The question is asking for change_hrs(‘09:04’, 5), which is not equivalent to ‘9:04’. You can actually see the ‘9:04’ example a little above; it’s given to you by the lab (and it is one of the answers you were thinking about)

   Oh great. I just saw the example. Would you mind restating what you meant by "The question is asking for change_hrs(‘09:04’, 5), which is not equivalent to ‘9:04’." Do you mean the correct answer is not equivalent to '9:04'? Also, I entered the correct answer according to the example and I am still getting an incorrect message. Picture included below.

    (I've deleted the student's screenshot of their answer --- please see the pinned post describing the (no)-answer posting policy: posting one's own answers is not allowed.  https://edstem.org/us/courses/3933/discussion/248698)

      I just went back and checked. I now understand my mistake (no leading zeros).

     Hi! I'm glad you're asking these questions!

     It's important to carefully read the specifications for a function and look carefully at inputs---- computer programming, and CS1110, are not places where one should skim!
     <break>

     The strings "09:04" and "9:04" are, literally, not the same; one is longer than the other.
     <break>
     </break>
     <break>
     </break>
     Are they the same according to how
     <code>
      change_hrs
     </code>
     "views" them? If we look at the
     <i>
      preconditions
     </i>
     for the function, they are not ... can you see why?
    </p>
