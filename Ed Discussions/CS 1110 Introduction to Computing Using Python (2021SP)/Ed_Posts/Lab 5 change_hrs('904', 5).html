  Hi guys,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I'm not sure what the policy is on questions about a specific part of the lab, so apologies in advance if this isn't an acceptable question.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  In section 1 of lab 5 there a question that asks what I think will be the output for change_hrs('9:04', 5) I thought it would be either (edit: answers) but none of those seem to be correct.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Anybody know how change_hrs works?

  The question is asking for change_hrs(‘09:04’, 5), which is not equivalent to ‘9:04’. You can actually see the ‘9:04’ example a little above; it’s given to you by the lab (and it is one of the answers you were thinking about)

  Oh great. I just saw the example. Would you mind restating what you meant by "The question is asking for change_hrs(‘09:04’, 5), which is not equivalent to ‘9:04’." Do you mean the correct answer is not equivalent to '9:04'? Also, I entered the correct answer according to the example and I am still getting an incorrect message. Picture included below.

  Hi! I'm glad you're asking these questions!
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  It's important to carefully read the specifications for a function and look carefully at inputs---- computer programming, and CS1110, are not places where one should skim!

  The strings "09:04" and "9:04" are, literally, not the same; one is longer than the other.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  Are they the same according to how
  <code>
   change_hrs
  </code>
  "views" them? If we look at the
  <italic>
   preconditions
  </italic>
  for the function, they are not ... can you see why?

  (I've deleted the student's screenshot of their answer --- please see the pinned post describing the (no)-answer posting policy: posting one's own answers is not allowed.  https://edstem.org/us/courses/3933/discussion/248698)

  I just went back and checked. I now understand my mistake (no leading zeros).
