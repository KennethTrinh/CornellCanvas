  Hello, everyone! I know this is not on the top of everyone's list right now, but I just wanted to ask about regrade requests for A4. How long to regrade requests usually take? When should we expect feedback? I know the deadline has just passed, but I just want to make sure I submitted everything correctly. Thank you!

  We were doing regrade responsibility parcelling-out starting yesterday night, so processing should start pretty soon.
