<p>
 When we draw call frames for a function with a return statement, should we draw two separate call frames for the return frame and the "cross-out" return frame?
</p>
<p>
 In other words, should I draw the return call frame once without a red cross-out and then draw an exact copy below WITH a cross-out?
</p>
<p>
 Should I do the same for variables? When I make a box for a = 5, and then assign 7 to a, should I draw an entirely new 'a' box with the new value and cross-out the old one, or should I just cross out the a = 5 box and write 7 in the crossed-out box instead?
</p>
<p>
 Thank you!
</p>

  You only need to draw a single call frame for the execution of each function - no need to draw a separate frame for the cross out step. The same goes for variables - each variable should only have one box in the frame with values that are crossed out whenever the value of the variable changes.
