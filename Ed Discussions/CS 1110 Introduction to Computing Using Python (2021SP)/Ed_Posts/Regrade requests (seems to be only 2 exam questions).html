 How do we submit a regrade request for an exam question? It is not really possible on GradeScope since there are only 2 exam questions.

 Thanks

  Sorry, are you looking at CS1110 Spring 2021 instead of any of the alternate "courses" that were used for online exams?

  I think this might be a URL that students can use to get to the "right" version of the exam:
  <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/230805">
