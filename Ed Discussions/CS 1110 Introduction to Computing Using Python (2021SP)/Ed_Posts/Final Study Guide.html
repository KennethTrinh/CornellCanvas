  Aiming for tomorrow or Friday at the latest, yes!  Been working on it.  Not clear if I'll have time to write testing code for back exams, though.

  I know this may be a tad premature at this point, but one follow up I have is in previous Prelims there were questions that asked Loop Invariants, drawing horizontal notational representations, etc. Conceptually they seemed similar to the algorithms for sorting but not exactly the same. Are students expected to answer these questions? (Example answer posted for reference)

  Invariants diagrams and writing code that must respect invariants will NOT be on the Spring 2021 final!
