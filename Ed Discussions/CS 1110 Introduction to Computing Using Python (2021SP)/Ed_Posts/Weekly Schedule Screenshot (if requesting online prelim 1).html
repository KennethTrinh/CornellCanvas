  If I am not in Ithaca but would like to take the prelim at 6:30pm Ithaca time, do I still need to submit my weekly schedule screenshot? My schedule does not conflict with the exam; I'm just not in the US.

  Good question!  Let's say "yes", just in case a conflict should come up (crazier things have happened than some other class deciding to move their exam).
