 When we run our code, our dictionary object at scname is treated as a list instead of a dictionary object, so we get this error when we run our code. How do we fix this?

  (please don't post portions of your code to ed discussions.  If you need someone to look at your code, please go to office/consulting hours.  But very often, just showing the error messages is enough!)

  Okay.  Just looking at your error message and not the code you posted:
 </p>
 <p>
  It is possible that you are appending colleges not already in cdict without making sure that they are college objects first, which may be a possible cause for your error message.
 </p>

  -Hope this helps! :)

  -edit: removed a portion of my answer that was misguided
