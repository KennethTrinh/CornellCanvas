 Put in your question title the year, semester, and question.  Ideal would also be to include the topic.   Example: 2018SP Q2(b) - call frames
</callout>
<callout type="info">
 Include a screenshot of the question, so readers/answerers don't have to go find the relevant pdf.
</callout>
<p>
 I am not sure what is the difference between answer b and c. Can I get some help?

  Unless I'm wrong, this would be the case where the function is being called by another function - consider the case where a separate function fun2 employs a call to fun1. I believe C would refer to the call frame for fun2, the function that called fun1.
