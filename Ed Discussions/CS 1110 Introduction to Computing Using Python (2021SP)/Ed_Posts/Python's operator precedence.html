 Why does exponentiation having higher precedence than the unary operators matter? In what expression would the result be different if the opposite were true?

  -2**3 is same as -2^3.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is equivalent to cubing 2 and then negating your answer.
  <break>
  </break>
  It is different from (-2)**3 or (-2)^3.
  <break>
  </break>
  In this case, the parenthesis takes precedence. Hence the solution would be cubing -2

  Good question!
  <break>
  </break>
  Here's some expressions that demonstrate:
 </p>
 <pre>Python 3.8.5 (default, Sep  4 2020, 02:22:02)
[Clang 10.0.0 ] :: Anaconda, Inc. on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; -(2**2)
-4
&gt;&gt;&gt; (-2)**2
4
&gt;&gt;&gt; -2**2
-4</pre>
 <p>
  So you can see that Python treats -2**2 as if there were invisible parentheses around the "2**2" part, i.e., the exponentiation gets done before the unary-minus gets applied.
