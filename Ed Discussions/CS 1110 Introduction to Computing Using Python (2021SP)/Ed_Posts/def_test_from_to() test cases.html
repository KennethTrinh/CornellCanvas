 For def_test_from_to(),  I included a test case where start_str and end_str are the same. I was unable to find anything in the preconditions that would suggest that this is not a viable input, but I'm not sure. Should it be included as a test case, and if it should, do I also need to add test cases where such value appears both more and less than 2 times in the text string?

  If the precondition says that such a call is fine, then it would be a good thing to test.

   If the value only appears once does it still meet the preconditions?

    Can't answer that, sorry. But the preconditions are (pretty) straightforward, so if you think it meets the preconditions then go ahead!
