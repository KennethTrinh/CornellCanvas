 I'm wondering what the grade breakdown for this class is -- does anyone know how labs vs prelims vs assignments/projects vs participation is split? And for participation is it based on polling in class/attending live lecture or attending discussion or neither? I tried to find a syllabus but couldn't find anything. Thanks!
