  When I run my code it is able to run but the menu listing shows duplicates of college names (e.g. there are supposed to be &lt;300 college options but I get ~1000). This is for the sd_utilities_list version. Not sure what is going on

  Okay. I have gotten a similar error when I was working on my A5, and the source of that error was an incorrect implementation of the while loop for the process line function in sd_utilities_list. Also, try the small data set, I think this would help you in debugging your while loop in the process line function of sd_utilities_list as there are only like 5 college choices!
