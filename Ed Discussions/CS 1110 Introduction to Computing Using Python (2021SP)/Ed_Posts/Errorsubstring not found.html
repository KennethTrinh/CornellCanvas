 When I try to get the string of day from the string of other course time, python exits with Error "substring not found". I do not know what is wrong with my code. Could somebody help me with that? Many Thanks.

  Post edited to remove students code.  Students may not post their own code to Ed Discussions, because they are not permitted to show their code to other students.
