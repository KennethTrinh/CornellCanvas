 After I downloaded Atom Editor, when I try to open a new project, there is a pop up that asks, "The "git" command requires the command line developer tools. Would you like to install the tools now?" The options they give are Get XCode, Not Now, and Install. What should I do?

  Installing command line developer tools would be very useful if you intend to use the skills you gain from this class in the future (if you plan to keep using CS), since tools as git are widely used in programming (and you would use it in most future CS classes), but it is not completely necessary for this class, and you can install them whenever you want later.
 </p>
 <p>
  XCode is basically MacOS’ Atom Editor, but it is kind of heavy (around or more than 4GB), and it would install the developer tools too.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s up to you. I’d recommend to “Install” at the very least, since you’ll have some useful tools you might end up using, but you can choose whichever you’d prefer
