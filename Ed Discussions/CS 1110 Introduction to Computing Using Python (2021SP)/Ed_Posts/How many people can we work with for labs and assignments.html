  It says 'small groups' and 'limited collaboration', and I just wanted to get some more specific numbers.

  While not as specific as you requested in regards to numbers for lab work,
  <link href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs1110/2021sp/policies/cs1110integrity.html"/>
  here is the class policy from the course website. Let me know if this is sufficient or you'd like more specificity/further clarification

  Course staff member Dylan has already pointed to the location of the lab policy, which I copy here for reference:
 </paragraph>
 <blockquote>
  LABS
  <break>
  </break>
  You are freely allowed to collaborate with, give help to, and get aid from any other student in this class
  <italic>
   if
  </italic>
  this is done as synchronous, small-group, joint work. We
  <italic>
   ask
  </italic>
  that during such sessions you do not just give or receive answers without also explaining them/getting an explanation of them; otherwise, the educational purpose of the labs is lost.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  However, we want all students to get the educational value of working through lab exercises without having previously seen the answers. Therefore,
  <italic>
   you may not post answers to lab questions in broad forums
  </italic>
  , such as the course Ed Discussions site.
  <break>

  You'll get specifics on the assignment handouts, but on the course homepage, if you see the text (underline added)

  Going to the underlined link will show, among other things,  the following text (underline added)
 </paragraph>
 <blockquote>
  <bold>
   Workload and grading.
  </bold>
  Workload and primary basis for grading: twice-weekly lab exercises (even though lab meetings are scheduled only once a week); 5-8
  <underline>
   programming assignments,
  </underline>
  <underline>
   which can be done in pairs or alone
  </underline>
