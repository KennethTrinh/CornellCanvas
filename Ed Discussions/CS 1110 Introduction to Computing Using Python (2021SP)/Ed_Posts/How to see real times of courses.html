  My code has been running well, but gives me :
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  Running test_course_conflictswith
  <break>
  </break>
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  <break>
  </break>
  File "schedule_tests.py", line 297, in &lt;module&gt;
  <break>
  </break>
  testfn() # Adding the parentheses calls whatever testfn is
  <break>
  </break>
  File "schedule_tests.py", line 158, in test_course_conflictswith
  <break>
  </break>
  _assert_msg(codename1 + " v. " + codename2, expected, result)
  <break>
  </break>
  AssertionError: CS1110 v. CS1110 should be True, but is False
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  How can I see what the listed times for both instances of CS110 are to fix my code?
  <break>
  </break>
  I inserted print statements, but it lists the times for every class and I can't tell which is for what Course Name.

  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Please run a6_in_action.  I recommend passing everything in a6_in_action before running the test file.  This is what I did, and it helped me pass all the test cases in the test file.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  You will also see the time for CS1110 in a6_in_action.

  Best,

  The file roster_creation.py has the list of courses that are used in testing. The list entry
  <code>
   "CS1110": Course("CS 1110 LEC 001", "TR 9:05am-9:55am")
  </code>
  tells you that CS 1110 occurs during that time (for both instances).
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  (Note that once you start testing
  <code>
   test_course_changetime
  </code>
  , some of the course times will no longer be the same as in roster_creation.py)

  Also, incidentally, every course should always conflict with itself.
