 My code has been running well, but gives me :
 <break>
 </break>
 <break>
 </break>
 Running test_course_conflictswith
 <break>
 </break>
 Traceback (most recent call last):
 <break>
 </break>
 File "schedule_tests.py", line 297, in &lt;module&gt;
 <break>
 </break>
 testfn() # Adding the parentheses calls whatever testfn is
 <break>
 </break>
 File "schedule_tests.py", line 158, in test_course_conflictswith
 <break>
 </break>
 _assert_msg(codename1 + " v. " + codename2, expected, result)
 <break>
 </break>
 AssertionError: CS1110 v. CS1110 should be True, but is False
</p>
<p>
 How can I see what the listed times for both instances of CS110 are to fix my code?
 <break>
 </break>
 I inserted print statements, but it lists the times for every class and I can't tell which is for what Course Name.

  Also, incidentally, every course should always conflict with itself.

   The file roster_creation.py has the list of courses that are used in testing. The list entry
   <code>
    "CS1110": Course("CS 1110 LEC 001", "TR 9:05am-9:55am")
   </code>
   tells you that CS 1110 occurs during that time (for both instances).
  </p>
  <p>
   (Note that once you start testing
   <code>
    test_course_changetime
   </code>
   , some of the course times will no longer be the same as in roster_creation.py)
  </p>

    Hi,
   </p>
   <p>
    Please run a6_in_action.  I recommend passing everything in a6_in_action before running the test file.  This is what I did, and it helped me pass all the test cases in the test file.
   </p>
   <p>
    You will also see the time for CS1110 in a6_in_action.
   </p>
   <p>
    Best,
   </p>
   <p>
    Troy
