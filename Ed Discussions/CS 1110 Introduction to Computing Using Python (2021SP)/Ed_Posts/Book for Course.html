 Hello! I just had a quick question about the textbook for this course. According to the Cornell Bookstore page, the book will be made available via INSTANT ACCESS-VitalSource on Canvas. However, the only two tabs I can currently see on Canvas are the Homepage and Announcements. Will the tab for the textbook be unlocked soon or am I not looking in the right place? Is anyone else having this problem or am I the only one? Thank you!

  Hello Professor!
 </p>
 <p>
  I was planning to use the pdf version of the textbook for the rest of the semester, and so I've been trying to opt-out of the Instant Access program. However, as far as I know, the only way you can opt-out is through the INSTANT ACCESS-VitalSource on Canvas, which is not present. What should my next steps be?
 </p>

     You're welcome! Sorry we didn't realize earlier that we needed to have the Canvas option open!

   Hi, thanks for trying out Ed Discussions!!

  <p>
   We'll announce this in lecture tomorrow and get it posted to the website soon, but the textbook is actually free online, so I think instant access isn't going to be broadly necessary (let us know if you prefer it, though).

   Here's the info and link that will soon-ish be accessible the course homepage from "Semester Information", item 3:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   The main text for CS1110 is
   <b>
    Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist
   </b>
   , Second Edition, by Allen B. Downey. Although we refer to the text, it does present material in a fundamentally different order than we do. Consider it a good
   <i>
    supplementary
   </i>
   reference.
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
   We recommend that you get the PDF or eBook, which is available free online. You can download it from
   <a href="http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/">
    Green Tree
   </a>
   Press.
