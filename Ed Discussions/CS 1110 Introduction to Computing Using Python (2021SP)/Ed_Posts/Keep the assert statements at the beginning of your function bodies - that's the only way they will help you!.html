 Title: Keep the "assert" statements at the *beginning* of your function bodies - that's the only way they will help you!

  Hi all,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  We had anticipated some of the issues students would wrestle with, and to fend them off, had added extra
  <code>
   assert
  </code>
  statements to the function bodies.  These help check the types of the arguments.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  However, for these
  <code>
   assert
  </code>
  statements to give you the intended warnings at the right time, you need to obey the instructions:
 </paragraph>
 <pre># STUDENTS: leave these assert statements here. They help prevent recursion # errors where calls are given unexpected argument types. 

# STUDENTS: Complete the implementation, making effective use of recursion.
</pre>
 <paragraph>
  That is, make sure you did NOT delete the
  <code>
   assert
  </code>
  statements, and have those `assert statements be the
  <italic>
   first lines
  </italic>
  of your function implementations: start your code where it says "Complete the implementation", not beforehand.
 </paragraph>
