 Title: Keep the "assert" statements at the *beginning* of your function bodies - that's the only way they will help you!

 Hi all,
</p>
<p>
 We had anticipated some of the issues students would wrestle with, and to fend them off, had added extra
 <code>
  assert
 </code>
 statements to the function bodies.  These help check the types of the arguments.
</p>
<p>
 However, for these
 <code>
  assert
 </code>
 statements to give you the intended warnings at the right time, you need to obey the instructions:
</p>
<pre># STUDENTS: leave these assert statements here. They help prevent recursion # errors where calls are given unexpected argument types. 

# STUDENTS: Complete the implementation, making effective use of recursion.
</pre>
<p>
 That is, make sure you did NOT delete the
 <code>
  assert
 </code>
 statements, and have those `assert statements be the
 <i>
  first lines
 </i>
 of your function implementations: start your code where it says "Complete the implementation", not beforehand.
</p>
