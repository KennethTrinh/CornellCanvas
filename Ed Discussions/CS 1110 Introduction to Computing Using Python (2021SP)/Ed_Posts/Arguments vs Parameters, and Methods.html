  Put in your question title the year, semester, and question.  Ideal would also be to include the topic.   Example: 2018SP Q2(b) - call frames

  Include a screenshot of the question, so readers/answerers don't have to go find the relevant pdf.

  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  What is the difference between a parameter and argument? Is a parameter only for function definitions?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Also, in 2013 spring prelim 1, why is P a method call? Is it referring to the expression join(...)?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thanks!

  Arguments are the values given to a function as input.

  Parameters are the variables where the function stores the values given as input.

  You can tell P is a method call by the fact that it's called by "&lt;some object&gt;.&lt;method_name&gt;".  A method can only be called by including an object that has access to that method and then a "dot", and then the method name.

  This makes sense because "join" is designed to work with respect to a specific string, the one that is going to be the "joiner".
