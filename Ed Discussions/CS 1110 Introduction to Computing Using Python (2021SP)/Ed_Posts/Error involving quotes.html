<p>
 expected ['D, E'] but instead got ['D', 'E']
</p>
<p>
 How would I get rid of the inside quotes?
</p>

  Think about how you are creating your string paths, and how you can use string concatenation appropriately when making your user paths list. Remember that strings can be concatenated as follows:
 </p>
 <p>
  concat_str = str1 + str2 + str3
 </p>
 <p>
  Also, remember that the user paths list is a list of strings, each of which represents a path, not simply individual posts.
