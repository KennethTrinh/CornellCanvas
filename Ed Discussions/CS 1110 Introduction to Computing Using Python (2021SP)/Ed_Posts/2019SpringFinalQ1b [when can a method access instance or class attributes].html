  Hi, good question!

  Remember that in a method/function looks within its call frame to figure out what variables are being referred to.

  In order for D to be true, one would have needed the call to be something like o.b1 where o is an object. An instance/object attribute needs to be referred to with respect to some "enclosing" object --- the folder that attribute is in.

  </break>

  </break>
  In order for E to be true, one would have needed the call to C.b1 , i.e., saying that one is referring to the b1 that is in class C.
