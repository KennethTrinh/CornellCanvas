 I am wondering why the answers D and E incorrect for the question
</p>
<p>
 Suppose that fun1 is a class method for the class C and it has the following line of code in it: a1 = b1 * 2. Where might the variable b1 that was referred to in this line of code be located?
</p>
<p>
 D. an instance/object attribute of an object of type C
</p>
<p>
 E. a class attribute of class C
</p>

  Hi, good question!
  <break>

  Remember that in a method/function looks within its call frame to figure out what variables are being referred to.

  In order for D to be true, one would have needed the call to be something like o.b1 where o is an object. An instance/object attribute needs to be referred to with respect to some "enclosing" object --- the folder that attribute is in.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  In order for E to be true, one would have needed the call to C.b1 , i.e., saying that one is referring to the b1 that is in class C.
