  Hey,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Seems like you appending stuff wrong.  The first schedule is the roster, right? So the roster should only have the time change warning.  Then, every schedule after that, you also need to append the time change warnings and the time conflict warnings for every student schedule.  Please use the in_schedules attribute in your changeTime function.
