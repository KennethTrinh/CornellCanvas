 Hello,
</p>
<p>
 I wrote a function for draw but am having an issue when running cardstuff_test.py because it says on line 24 it expects len(deck1) to be 0 but it is 1. Two lines above, deck1 is defined as a tuple with one entry so how should the result be 0? Am I missing something or is there a problem?
</p>
<p>
 Thank you!
</p>

  I'm happy to see students looking carefully at what the test code is doing!

  Note that the
  <code>
   draw
  </code>
  function should remove the drawn card from the deck --- if you draw a card from the deck but it's still in the deck, something has gone wrong with physical reality!

  Just kidding, but a
  <code>
   draw
  </code>
  function that doesn't remove the drawn card from the deck is violating the specification.
