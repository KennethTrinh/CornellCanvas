  I'm a little bit confused on when something should be a method and when it should be a function.

  Hey there!
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Method functions usually have “self” as the first parameter in the function in addition to the parameters of original function.  For instance, the non-method function data_prompt(filename=“”) would turn into data_prompt(self, filename=“”) as a method function. (Sorry if this is the incorrect name of the function/parameter, I’m currently getting vaccinated lol so I can’t look at my A5 ;-; )
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Now, when you look at the “self” parameter, see if it would harm, do nothing, or contribute to a class overall as a method function as opposed to a non-method function.  So, look at class attributes and relate them to the non-method function.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  A helpful thing to do, according to the A5 document, is to consider changing some of the non-method functions into method functions and see what they do.
