  When we write our answers, do we need to include the code/docstring that was given to us in the original question or will just our answer be sufficient?

  No need to include the whole docstring, but if the question is to implement something as such:
 </paragraph>
 <snippet language="py" line-numbers="true" runnable="true">
  <snippet-file id="code">
   def whatever(a, b):
    """loren
    ipsum
    """
    # STUDENTS: implement this
  </snippet-file>
 </snippet>
 <paragraph>
  it would be nice of you to just include line 1 and then start coding!
