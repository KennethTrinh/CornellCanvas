  I am having trouble figuring out how to access each post, rather than just the replies of one post.  I read in a previous post that we can use main_dict, but I am unsure exactly how to use it.  I am trying to use it in the second task, and having trouble.  Is there another way to access the posts?

  If you've set the main tree up via
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  <code>
   [main_tree, main_dict] = main_example_tree()
  </code>
  or
  <code>
   [main_tree, main_dict] = a4_test.main_example_tree()
  </code>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  then you can access a Post by mentioning its Gorn number:
  <break>
  </break>
  main_dict["0.0.1"] will return that Post.
  <break>
  </break>
 </paragraph>
 <pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; import a4_test
&gt;&gt;&gt; [main_tree, main_dict] = a4_test.main_example_tree()
&gt;&gt;&gt; p010 = main_dict["0.1.0"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; p010.author
'B'
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(p010)
Post 010 by B:
    Reply ids/authors (if any):
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(type(p010))
&lt;class 'post.Post'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(main_dict["0.0.0"])
Post 000 by C:
    Reply ids/authors (if any): 0000 by 'B'

</pre>

  But I think I'm probably not understanding what you're actually asking.  Please follow up to help me answer your question better if I can!
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  For
  <code>
   user_paths(post)
  </code>
  ,
  <code>
   post
  </code>
  is a Post object, so you access
  <code>
   post
  </code>
  directly from within the body of the function.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  And so you can say things like
  <code>
   post.author
  </code>
  or
  <code>
   post.tag
  </code>
  , and those will refer to the attributes of the input Post object.

  You answered my question, thank you!  I think the problem is that I am confused on how to return multiple strings inside of my user_paths list.   My thought process was to access each parent post via the dictionary, but I am sure there is a better way.

  yes, in terms of thinking about this recursively, you want to say, "OK, I have this Post
  <code>
   post,
  </code>
  and suppose I had, for each reply, a list of its paths; how would i get the answer for this
  <code>
   post
  </code>
  by incorporating the lists for each reply?
