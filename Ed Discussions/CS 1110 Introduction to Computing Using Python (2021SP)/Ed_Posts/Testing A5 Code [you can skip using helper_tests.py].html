 I cannot seem to figure a way to test the new process_line function.
</p>
<p>
 I already changed the names of the imports in the provided helper_tests.py:
</p>
<p>
 import cornellasserts
</p>
<p>
 import
 <b>
  college_a5
 </b>
 as college_module # minimize name confusion
</p>
<p>
 import
 <b>
  sd_utilities_list
 </b>
 as sdu
</p>
<p>
 import inspect # to print the name of a (test) function that is running import copy
</p>
<p>
 However, even after fixing the import statements, the tests cannot run because college_a5 does not have "was_accepted" attribute.
</p>
<p>
 How can I test my code?
</p>
<p>
 I tried to modify the A3 code to run my new process_line but the process_line code is inherently different now since we are using add_student().

  Hi!

  I probably shouldn't have included the helper_tests.py file --- I forgot to take it out of the code distribution, but I wasn't expecting students to use it.
  <break>
  </break>

  </break>
  I did all my testing just by running the new showdown file: from Section 5 of the handout: "All the code you’ll write in this assignment should have the same functionality as what you wrote in A3. So, you only need to check that running showdown_time_a5.py produces the same results as running A3’s showdown_time.py."

   If you
   <i>
    do
   </i>
   want to use helper_tests.py, you are on the right track --- modifying it to take into account the changes.  So I am very pleased that you were working on it, even though you didn't have to ...

   You would indeed have to adjust for the fact that the function was_accepted() was changed into the College method accepted().  You can look inside showdown_time_a5.py's script code (at the bottom) to see how I changed it (in comparison to the A3 code) to handle this adjustement.
