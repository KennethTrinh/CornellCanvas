 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 I keep getting the error "... code doesn't seem to involve the input variable `timestr`" This happens when I paste my code from my module or Atom. I am not sure whether I am supposed to post my module coding or coding in Terminal. Whenever I post my coding in Terminal, I get a "syntax error: invalid syntax." Also, everything is correct because I just got done working with the professor. I am just having trouble on what to copy and paste for the last question.
</p>

  Hi, I've taken a look at what you've entered for into the lab system, and I think I can see what is going on.  I'm sorry for the frustration you're feeling.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  In general, if you've written code for the problem by putting it into a function in a file, that's great, because that's what one would want to do in real life! So this explains why the "other prof" (Prof. Fan) and you worked out a good solution.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  So, the problem is just confusion about what exactly to put into the lab server's answer box.
  <break>
  </break>
 </p>
 <p>
  Let's suppose that the file you wrote in is called lab03.py, and inside lab03.py you've written a function
  <code>
   f_hi
  </code>
  that takes a timestring as input and returns the the hours part of the timestring.  This means you've taken the route suggested in sidenote b, which is great!
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  What you should then paste into the answer box is: the contents of your
  <code>
   f_hi
  </code>
  function, unindented --- that is, the lines that make up the body of
  <code>
   f_hi
  </code>
  --- not the header, and not the return statement, but the body ---
  <break>
  </break>
  and unindented.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  If your return statement does some computation, like
  <code>
   return x + y + x
  </code>
  , then make the final line you paste into the answer box
  <code>
   hours_int = x + y + z
  </code>
  .
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  In other words, we're asking you to translate the
  <i>
   body
  </i>
  of your function
  <code>
   f_hi
  </code>
  into code we can test the effect of in our lab system!  Hence, this sentence from the lab description,
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  For this exercise, don't define a function; instead, write lines of code that could be included inside a function body (but not indented). So a sample answer could look like:
  <break>
  </break>
  <code>
   pos = 2
   <break>
   </break>
   hours_int = timestr[pos]
  </code>
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
 </blockquote>

   Hello, I did and now I'm getting the message that states my module name is not defined. Should I change the module name to the given onec"test_hours_int.py" in order for it to be identified?

    Sorry, no, what you paste in shouldn't be using any modules --- the lab system doesn't understand about modules you've defined, unfortunately.
   </p>
   <p>
    What you should do is paste into the box what is
    <i>
     inside
    </i>
    of your module file.
    <break>
    </break>
    So, for example, suppose inside your module file
    <code>
     lab03.py
    </code>
    you had a function
    <code>
     f_hi
    </code>
    , like this:
    <break>
    </break>
    <break>
    </break>
    Picture of lab03.py:
   </p>
   <snippet language="py" line-numbers="true" runnable="true">
    <snippet-file id="code">
     def f_hi(timestr):
    pos = 2
    return timestr[pos]
    </snippet-file>
   </snippet>
   <p>
    <break>
    </break>
    <break>
    </break>
    Then, what you should paste into the lab answer box is:
    <break>
    </break>
    <i>
     not
    </i>
   </p>
   <p>
    <code>
     lab03.f_hi(timestr)
    </code>
    <break>
    </break>
    <b>
     but
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    <code>
     pos = 2
    </code>
   </p>
   <p>
    <code>
     hours_int = timestr[pos]
    </code>
   </p>

    I understand what you are saying. I did that earlier and got a error message.

     Great, you're very close!
     <break>
     </break>
     <break>
     </break>
     Notice that what the error message is saying: "code may not be creating/assigning to the variable hours_int".
     <break>
     </break>
     <break>
     </break>
     I can see in your code that indeed, you are not creating the variable
     <code>
      hours_int
     </code>
     .  You're creating a
     <i>
      different
     </i>
     variable ...
     <break>
     </break>
     <break>
     </break>
     Can you look carefully at what you've entered and see what you need to change, i.e., what you need to rewrite as
     <code>
      hours_int
     </code>
     in order to get the lab machine to accept your answer?

      That is what I did earlier. I just tried it again, but changed a variable instead of creating one, but I got the same error message: ... code doesn't seem to involve the input variable `timestr`

       Yes, your code is still crashing.  I now see for you the error message "Here is what Python reported as the problem: name 'hrs' is not defined"
       <break>
       </break>
       <break>
       </break>
       And indeed,
       <code>
        hrs
       </code>
       is not defined.  What is the one variable the lab exercise says you can assume is defined...?

        There are actually 1:1s happening this afternoon, and I think that you've made great progress with Prof. Fan but could use someone talking to you "face to face" about how to translate what's in your code to what the lab question can accept.
       </p>
       <p>
        Could you please sign up for a 1:1 on CMS?  You are
        <i>
         sooooo
        </i>
        close, but it would be helpful to talk to someone over your code.

     Yeah, I can't quite tell what it is from this error message, so I'd recommend going to office hours sometime today.
     <break>
     </break>
     Still, some insight that might be helpful: on the Terminal you are trying to test your code, while the actual code you are making is in your Atom Editor, so that is what you would be copying and pasting. Nevertheless, from the error it might be that you're indenting something in "line 9" when you should not be (as you can see by that random space before the ^), or that something in line 8 or 10 is not being properly indented. Try to check if it's either of those.

      Thats what I did. I went to morning offices hours and developed a code with the professor. Everything worked, all I had left was to copy and paste it. Now, I am copying it but I keep getting an error. Now it is telling me "... code doesn't seem to involve the input variable `timestr`"

      It looks like you're copying the entirety of the Python interpreter's text -- you don't have to copy the output that the interpreter gives you, just the lines that you put in. Also note that you should be modifying
      <code>
       timestr
      </code>
      with your function and that modification should take place in the interpreter. It looks like you're using a module of some kind to get your code into Python -- try just typing your code directly into the interpreter instead.
