 This is what I got, but in figure 2, some of the "open"s I got were closed. Is that fine?

  That is OK as long as the answers match
  <a href="https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/SP21/class/CS/1110">

  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  (Reason this happened: Since the assignment came out after add period, I figured the open/closed statuses ("stati"?) of sections wouldn't change.  I forgot about people dropping!)
