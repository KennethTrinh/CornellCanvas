 Put in your question title the year, semester, and question.  Ideal would also be to include the topic.   Example: 2018SP Q2(b) - call frames
</callout>
<callout type="info">
 Include a screenshot of the question, so readers/answerers don't have to go find the relevant pdf.

 For this problem my code is very similar to the solution but I don't understand what went wrong. It returns:
</p>
<p>
 (555) -666-1110
</p>
<p>
 (555) -666 - 1110
</p>
<p>
 (555) -666-1110
</p>
<p>
 I think the only part different is the second line, but I didn't know .rindex() was a function so I was trying to use index, but with a starting value.

#how can you make sure you start looking for the index of the second dash AFTER the
