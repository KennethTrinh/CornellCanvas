 Hello, all! I just had a quick question about partnering rules. On the rules for the assignment, it says we must form a group on CMS before submitting the assignment if we choose to work with a partner. This will allow us to submit the same code for our assignments. However, what if, as partners, we only bounce ideas off of each other, each producing our own code? I want to work with a classmate, but I would still prefer to write my own code and submit my own version of the assignment. Will I be able to do this or if I seek any help from a partner, must I use the group feature on CMS (meaning we submit the same code)? Thank you!
</p>

  The course website, under "Policies" and "Collaboration rules specific to CS 1110", has specific guidelines on what you can and cannot do with your classmates. If you choose not to register your friend as a partner on CMS, then you must abide by the course rules. This means, among other things, that you cannot share or receive portions of code, which could include sharing the general structure or how you approached a problem. To be safe, it's generally a good idea to register the person you're working with as a partner so the two of you can share as many ideas as you want.
