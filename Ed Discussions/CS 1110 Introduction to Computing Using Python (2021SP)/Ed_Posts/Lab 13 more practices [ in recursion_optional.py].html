  In Lab 13, it mentioned that there are additional practices inside recursion_qs.py. However, I only saw one more. I did see that there are a lot of test functions in recursion_qs_test.py, but they are not in the recursion_qs.py. I wonder if Professor can post the rest of the Specifications. Thank you!

  Hi! The first page of Lab 13 was edited to include the following sentence:
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  File
  <link href="https://cs1110.cs.cornell.edu/files/cs1110sp21/lab13/recursion_optional.py"/>
  recursion_optional.py is the skeleton file for additional exercises. They are optional, but the testing file assumes that this file is in the same directory.
