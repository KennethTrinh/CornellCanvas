  Hello! I was working on Lab A (specifically the section Expressions involving division(s) and the modulus operator) and it mentions that we should contact a staff member when we have completed the exercise. I'm wondering if we should direct a message like this and future messages about labs to our TA or a general email account or someone else?

  I'm going to see what happens when I mark this post as a duplicate of when that happened
  <italic>
   after
  </italic>
  it: violating the temporal order, but the title of the other one is a little more searchable for students.

  Hi!  The intent for those instructions in Lab 1A is to prompt/encourage students to talk live to a staff member when you attend the lab section, in-person or online.

  The lab staff people will check your understanding, plus you'll get to become comfortable with approaching them about any questions you have!
