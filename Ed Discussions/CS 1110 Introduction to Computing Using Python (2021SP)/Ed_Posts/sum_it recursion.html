 I understand that by using the for loop
</p>
<p>
 sum_it (sublist, parameter 1, parameter 2 ...)
</p>
<p>
 you are making a recursive statement but how would you incorporate it in the actual function where there is just one parameter:
</p>
<p>
 sum_it (theinput)
</p>

  The
  <code>
   f(sublist, param2, param3, ..., paramn)
  </code>
  that we gave is for a general form of a solution structure; in this case, you're right, you wouldn't need the extra params.
 </p>
 <p>
  Is that what you were asking about?
