  I understand that by using the for loop
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  sum_it (sublist, parameter 1, parameter 2 ...)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  you are making a recursive statement but how would you incorporate it in the actual function where there is just one parameter:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  sum_it (theinput)

  The
  <code>
   f(sublist, param2, param3, ..., paramn)
  </code>
  that we gave is for a general form of a solution structure; in this case, you're right, you wouldn't need the extra params.
