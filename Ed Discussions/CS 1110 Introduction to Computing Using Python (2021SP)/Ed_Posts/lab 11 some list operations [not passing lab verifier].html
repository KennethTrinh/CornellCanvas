  Hi professor,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  For lab 11 first part some list operations, it is said that 'copy1 = lablist', but when I copy the value of lablist, it shows that incorrect. I don't know why. Could you please help on that? Thank you.

  In the python interactive mode, after execute 'copy1 = lablist', you can then execute 'copy1' and copy and paste everything the Python prints out. Make sure you include the square brackets.

  Hi, sorry I had to delete your screenshot, but you shouldn't be showing your lab answers in Ed Discussions.

  Your screenshot showed the incorrect answer for what Python's response was for the value of copy1, I'm afraid.  (Hint: your expectation was incorrect.)
