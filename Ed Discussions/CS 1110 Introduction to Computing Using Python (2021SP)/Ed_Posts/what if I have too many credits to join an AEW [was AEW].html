  If you want to take the AEW I recommend petitioning to increase your course credit limit. If you specify to the petition committee that the reason you want to increase your credit limit is that you want to take a 1-credit, attendance-based, S/U course, you will be likely to get your petition approved -- the credit limit's main purpose is preventing students from taking on more work than they can handle, and since the AEW isn't really much work at all but simply a time commitment, you should be fine.

  Here is the form (for the college of engineering) to petition for a credit overload:
  <a href="https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/departments/EN%20Registrar/Over%2023%20Credits%20Petition%20Form.pdf">
   link
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  Here's the general petition page for the college of arts and sciences:
  <link href="https://as.cornell.edu/registrar/petitions-policies"/>
  link
 </p>
 <p>
  Note that you're probably more likely to get a petition approved if you're in the COE rather than A&amp;S, especially if you're a freshman -- the COE has a specific form for petitioning for a credit overload, and A&amp;S didn't explicitly say that the petition could be used to petition for an increase in the allowed number of credits. (It might specify that on the petition PDF itself; I couldn't check because I'm not in A&amp;S myself.)

  Best of luck!
