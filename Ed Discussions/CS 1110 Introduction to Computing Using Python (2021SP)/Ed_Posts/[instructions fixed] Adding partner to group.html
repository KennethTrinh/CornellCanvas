  On CMS for Assignment 2, I do not see a place to add my partner. I see the current group and the little quiz, but no place to add a net ID. Is this just happening for me or everyone? How do I fix it?

  Sorry, I left some stray text in section 3.2 about CMS.  We're using Gradescope for submission of A2, as described in Section 8.4 --- see that section!
