 My score is too low, so I want to check the comment, but I don't know where it is.
</p>
<p>
 I can only check this "Please Read the feedback, Revise carefully, Resubmit, and then Request a Regrade." If anyone knows, please help!

  There should be a file that your grader has uploaded, detailing what you need to fix. Try checking again; it should be a .txt file.

  Please see

  for a graphical guide to using CMS. Specific advice on seeing feedback can be found under the "Seeing your grading feedback; making a regrade request" section.

   Thank you for the comment. However, I couldn't find any text file. Also, I've already checked the Grading Comments &amp; Requests section and found only this phrase: Please Read the feedback, Revise carefully, Resubmit, and then Request a Regrade.

   I think I should send an e-mail to the instructor who have graded my assignment.

    You definitely should! They should help clarify why that’s the only feedback you received.

    Also, make sure you’re checking the feedback in Part B, not A!

     Looks like you did contact the staff member, as Dylan recommended; I do see that the grader uploaded the actual feedback file for you at around 11pm Ithaca time last night.  Thanks for checking in with us!
