  If your error is something along the lines of "'tag' is not defined", then it most likely means that somewhere in your code, you are trying to use a variable 'tag' before giving it a value. Trace through the error message to see where you're using a nonexistent 'tag' variable. Note: just because the function 'was_accepted' has a parameter called 'tag' does not necessarily mean that the argument passed in for that parameter must also be called 'tag'.

  tag is just a variable; to define it, somewhere in your code you should have the line "tag = ..."
