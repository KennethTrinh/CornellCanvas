 When I run showdown with my new _dict implementation, I get the error:
</p>
<p>
 AttributeError: 'College' object has no attribute 'accepted'
</p>
<p>
 I have no idea which function is causing this error.

  <code>
   accepted
  </code>
  is actually the name of a method in the updated version of the College class. In college_a5.py, where class college is defined, is there a method that starts like this?
 </p>
 <pre>    def accepted(self, tag):
        """Returns True if the student with tag number `tag` was accepted at
        College c; returns False otherwise.
        etc...
</pre>
 <p>
  That method should have been in the provided skeleton
 </p>

   Hey!
  </p>
  <p>
   There is no attribute “accepted.”
   <break>
   </break>
   The following are College class attributes:
   <break>
   </break>
   -accepted_enrolled
   <break>
   </break>
   -accepted_not_enrolled
   <break>
   </break>
   -rejected
   <break>
   </break>
   -waitlisted
  </p>
  <p>
   -best of luck :))

    I don't believe I did anything that should cause this error.
   </p>
   <p>
    The traceback lists:
   </p>
   <p>
    Traceback (most recent call last): File ".\showdown_time_a5.py", line 113, in  sd = college_module.Showdown(c1, c2) File "C:\Users\David\Creative Cloud Files\skeleton\college_a5.py", line 135, in
    <b>
     init
    </b>
    if c2.accepted(c1_student): AttributeError: 'College' object has no attribute 'accepted'
   </p>
   <p>
    I didn't change anything in the college class.
   </p>

     Yes, but “accepted” is not a College class attribute. I think maybe there is something wrong with your process_line function. You should access the “.accepted_enrolled” of and “.accepted_not_enrolled” of lists of College objects in your process_line code, not “.accepted”, as “.accepted” is not a College class attribute. Hope this helps
