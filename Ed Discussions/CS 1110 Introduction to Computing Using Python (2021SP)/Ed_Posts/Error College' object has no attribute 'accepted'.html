  When I run showdown with my new _dict implementation, I get the error:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  AttributeError: 'College' object has no attribute 'accepted'
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I have no idea which function is causing this error.

  Hey!
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  There is no attribute “accepted.”
  <break>
  </break>
  The following are College class attributes:
  <break>
  </break>
  -accepted_enrolled
  <break>
  </break>
  -accepted_not_enrolled
  <break>
  </break>
  -rejected
  <break>
  </break>
  -waitlisted
 </paragraph>

  -best of luck :))

  I don't believe I did anything that should cause this error.

  The traceback lists:

   init

  if c2.accepted(c1_student): AttributeError: 'College' object has no attribute 'accepted'
 </paragraph>

  I didn't change anything in the college class.

  Yes, but “accepted” is not a College class attribute. I think maybe there is something wrong with your process_line function. You should access the “.accepted_enrolled” of and “.accepted_not_enrolled” of lists of College objects in your process_line code, not “.accepted”, as “.accepted” is not a College class attribute. Hope this helps

  <code>
   accepted
  </code>
  is actually the name of a method in the updated version of the College class. In college_a5.py, where class college is defined, is there a method that starts like this?
 </paragraph>
 <pre>    def accepted(self, tag):
        """Returns True if the student with tag number `tag` was accepted at
        College c; returns False otherwise.
        etc...
</pre>
 <paragraph>
  That method should have been in the provided skeleton
