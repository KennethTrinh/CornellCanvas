  Hello,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I was running a1first and got an error message for the function make_url. I didn't see anything in the instructions about having to change this function, so I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong or if there's some error. I'm attaching a picture of the error message and if needed I can attach a picture of my make_url to see if I accidentally changed something.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thank you!

  Hi, sorry, I'm not sure I understand your question.  Section 5.1 shows the specification for make_url, which is one of the functions to develop and test?

  I may just be confused about something small, but when I entered python a1_first.py to test my tag_endi and from_to functions, it quit after line 25 because of a problem with the function test_make_url. Did I just run the script wrong or is there something wrong with the test_make_url?
