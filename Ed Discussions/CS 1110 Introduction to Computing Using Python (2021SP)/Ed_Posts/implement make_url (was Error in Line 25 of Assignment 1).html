 Hello,
</p>
<p>
 I was running a1first and got an error message for the function make_url. I didn't see anything in the instructions about having to change this function, so I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong or if there's some error. I'm attaching a picture of the error message and if needed I can attach a picture of my make_url to see if I accidentally changed something.
</p>
<p>
 Thank you!

  (It's totally fine to share the error message! But just a reminder not to post your assignment code to Ed Discussions)

  Hi, sorry, I'm not sure I understand your question.  Section 5.1 shows the specification for make_url, which is one of the functions to develop and test?

   I may just be confused about something small, but when I entered python a1_first.py to test my tag_endi and from_to functions, it quit after line 25 because of a problem with the function test_make_url. Did I just run the script wrong or is there something wrong with the test_make_url?

     Oh, I see the problem. I think I figured it out but if I didn't I will come back. Thank you! I think I just forgot to change one part
