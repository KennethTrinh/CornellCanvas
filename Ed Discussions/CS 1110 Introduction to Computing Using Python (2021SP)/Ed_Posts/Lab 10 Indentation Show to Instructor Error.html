  (The underscores are where the code was as I don't know if I am allowed to post it)

  I've checked the indentation about 15 times and don't know what the error could be. Did anyone else encounter this error?

  Looking at your submission, it looks like your if, elif, and else are not properly aligned. Make sure that all if -&gt; elif -&gt; else blocks have the same alignment (that is, the same amount of space between them and the left of the page).
