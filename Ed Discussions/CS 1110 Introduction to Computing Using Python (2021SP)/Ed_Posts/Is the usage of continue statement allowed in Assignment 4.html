  While I was working on Assignment 4, I noticed that a function in a4_test.py used a "continue" statement. Having just learned it, I used "continue" to help complete the bnf_starts_here() function. Is this allowed, or am I to use another method that doesn't involve "continue"?

  You shouldn't need to use
  <code>
   continue
  </code>
  .  I did use it in the a4_test code, but it was just a shortcut for:
  <break>
  </break>

 <pre>if u2 == u1:
   pass
else:
   [rest of code]
</pre>
