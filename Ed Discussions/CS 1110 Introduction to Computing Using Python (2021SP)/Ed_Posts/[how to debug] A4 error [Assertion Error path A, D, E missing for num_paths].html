 When I run my code I get the following error
</p>
<p>
 Assertion Error: path A, D, E missing
</p>
<p>
 I made sure my code went through the entire list in post.replies. Why am I getting this error?

  You'll probably want to look at exactly what your code is returning for the case of the Post at 0.1.1 (which is where the path A, D, E starts at).
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  You can do this by suitably modifying the snippet we wrote for you in 7.1.3: "If you want to add additional testing — such as if you are having trouble getting any of the test cases to pass — you may want to add your own small-scale tests":
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  Add the my_own_private_testfn() to your testing code (name it whatever you like), and change what function it runs from bnf_starts_here to a4.num_paths and what the printout is.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>

   (Also, I don't think "running through the entire list in post.replies" is all one needs to do to get num_paths() implemented properly.)
