  Hi,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I am trying to download the A2-Spring 2020 solution but it fails(I tried with different browsers but failed too). Is there any way to access its solution?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thanks,

  I can confirm that trying to download the solutions to A2 from 2020 returns a server error. We'll see if we can make the solutions available again.

  Indeed, something strange happened with the 2020sp file (its name was changed to a2soln_hide.pdf; thereby, surely, hangs a tale whose resolution we are seeking out), but the official link on the 2021 assignment archive page now links to the solution file!

  Thanks Benjamin (and Jude behind the scenes) for the temporary fix!
