  Put in your question title the year, semester, and question.  Ideal would also be to include the topic.   Example: 2018SP Q2(b) - call frames
 </callout>
 <callout type="info">
  Include a screenshot of the question, so readers/answerers don't have to go find the relevant pdf.

  Why is the variable sum not included in the object folder with id2?

  Hi!
  <code>
   sum
  </code>
  is a local variable in the call frame from
  <code>
   __init__
  </code>
  , which the way this problem was written students were allowed to omit for that exam.

  Try the code in Python Tutor if you'd like to see the call frames visualized!

  Contrariwise, a reference to
