  When trying to complete the function was_accepted, I want to make a function to "find" the student's tag in the data. Is there a way for me to reference this data in the function?

  In the was_accepted function, the information about the student's tag should be searched for within the College that is given to was_accepted as an argument.

  Is the info in the College the "data" you are referring to, or did you mean the giant list of data for all colleges?  I wasn't sure.  If the latter: you don't need the giant list of data for all colleges to answer the question about the specific College object given as input.
