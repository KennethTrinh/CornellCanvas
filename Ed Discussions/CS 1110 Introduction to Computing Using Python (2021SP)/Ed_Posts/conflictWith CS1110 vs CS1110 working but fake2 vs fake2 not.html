  Hi there,
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  First off, Troy, if you happen to be the one reading this, thank you for your incredible kindness taking the time to answer so many of our posts. I know everyone really appreciates  your help, and your enthusiasm for CS is very admirable :)

  My question is related to the error message I receive while running confictsWith:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Running test_course_conflictswith
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Traceback (most recent call last):
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  File "schedule_tests.py", line 297, in &lt;module&gt;
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  testfn() # Adding the parentheses calls whatever testfn is
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  File "schedule_tests.py", line 157, in test_course_conflictswith
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  assert result == expected, \
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  AssertionError: fake2 v. fake2 should be True, but is False
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I find it odd that my CS1110 vs CS1110 test case is working, but not fake2 vs fake2. Is there a difference in these test cases that I am missing?

  Thank you!

  Hey Troy,

  I looked at these previously to help with some of the earlier test cases, and they were indeed very helpful. Is fake2 vs fake2 conceptually different from CS1110 vs CS1110? I guess my confusion is how one of these succeeds for me and the other does not, as they appear to be conceptually the same test case.
