 Hi there,
</p>
<p>
 First off, Troy, if you happen to be the one reading this, thank you for your incredible kindness taking the time to answer so many of our posts. I know everyone really appreciates  your help, and your enthusiasm for CS is very admirable :)
</p>
<p>
 My question is related to the error message I receive while running confictsWith:
</p>
<p>
 Running test_course_conflictswith
</p>
<p>
 Traceback (most recent call last):
</p>
<p>
 File "schedule_tests.py", line 297, in &lt;module&gt;
</p>
<p>
 testfn() # Adding the parentheses calls whatever testfn is
</p>
<p>
 File "schedule_tests.py", line 157, in test_course_conflictswith
</p>
<p>
 assert result == expected, \
</p>
<p>
 AssertionError: fake2 v. fake2 should be True, but is False
</p>
<p>
 I find it odd that my CS1110 vs CS1110 test case is working, but not fake2 vs fake2. Is there a difference in these test cases that I am missing?
</p>
<p>
 Thank you!
</p>

   Hey Troy,
  </p>
  <p>
   I looked at these previously to help with some of the earlier test cases, and they were indeed very helpful. Is fake2 vs fake2 conceptually different from CS1110 vs CS1110? I guess my confusion is how one of these succeeds for me and the other does not, as they appear to be conceptually the same test case.

   Thanks :)
