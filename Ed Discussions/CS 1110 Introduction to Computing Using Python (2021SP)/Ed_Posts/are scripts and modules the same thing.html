 Scripts and module files seem to be used interchangeably sometimes during the prelectures, but the textbook or online resources indicate otherwise. Are they essentially the same thing or can we assume so?

  Following up on Elisabeth's true and correct answer:
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  A metaphor that might be useful: imagine you had "modular" housing, with modules corresponding to rooms you can plug together.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are lots of different types of room modules, like kitchens and bedrooms and libraries.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  Now consider a bedroom: while you
  <i>
   can
  </i>
  sleep in any module, a bedroom is specially designed for sleeping in.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  So, a script is like a bedroom and a module is like any type of room.  Every script is a module, a script is intended to be run directly as Elisabeth says, and every module
  <i>
   could
  </i>
  be treated as a script ... Just like every bedroom is a room, and a bedroom is intended to be slept in, even though any type of room can be
  <i>
   treated
  </i>
  as a bedroom if needs must! (Any port in a storm, as they say)

   That's a good question. My understanding is that a
   <b>
    script
   </b>
   is a file that you run directly (say, from a command prompt), while a
   <b>
    module
   </b>
   is code that gets imported into another file. So the difference is in how you use the  file more than its contents.
