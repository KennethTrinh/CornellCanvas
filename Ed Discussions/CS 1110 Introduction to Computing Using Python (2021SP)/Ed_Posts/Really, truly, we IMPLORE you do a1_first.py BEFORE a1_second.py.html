 We absolutely want you to get in the habit of writing test cases for functions
 <b>
  before
 </b>
 you write the function bodies. This is one of the new "habits of mind" we referred to in the introductory lecture.
</p>
<p>
 Remember the lesson of Lecture 6, slide 13: "
 <b>
  <i>
   Test Cases can help you find errors in [your understanding of] the specification
  </i>
 </b>
 ".
</p>
<p>
 We know students don't find this natural at first. That's why we've set things up to force this new behavior: the A1 instructions say to do the test cases first, the files are named
 <code>
  a1_
  <b>
   first
  </b>
  .py
 </code>
 and
 <code>
  a1_
  <b>
   second.
  </b>
  py
 </code>
 , and the test cases are due before the function bodies.
 <break>
 </break>
 <break>
 </break>
 We promise: our own programming experience has taught us that doing the test cases first really helps you write better code, and write code better!!
