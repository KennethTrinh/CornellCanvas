  We absolutely want you to get in the habit of writing test cases for functions
  <bold>
   before
  </bold>
  you write the function bodies. This is one of the new "habits of mind" we referred to in the introductory lecture.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Remember the lesson of Lecture 6, slide 13: "
  <bold>
   <italic>
    Test Cases can help you find errors in [your understanding of] the specification
   </italic>
  </bold>
  ".

 <paragraph>
  We know students don't find this natural at first. That's why we've set things up to force this new behavior: the A1 instructions say to do the test cases first, the files are named
  <code>
   a1_
   <bold>
    first
   </bold>
   .py
  </code>
  and
  <code>
   a1_
   <bold>
    second.
   </bold>
   py
  </code>
  , and the test cases are due before the function bodies.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  We promise: our own programming experience has taught us that doing the test cases first really helps you write better code, and write code better!!
