 Put in your question title the year, semester, and question.  Ideal would also be to include the topic.   Example: 2018SP Q2(b) - call frames
</callout>
<callout type="info">
 Include a screenshot of the question, so readers/answerers don't have to go find the relevant pdf.

 I am confused as to why id4 and id6 are not empty lists.

  Hi!
  <break>
  </break>
  The diagram shows that id4 does become an empty list at the end.
 </p>
 <p>
  id6 is the list associated with the Tower named "right".  It
  <i>
   starts out
  </i>
  as the empty list, but the command "plan(left, right, middle, len(left.disks))" in line 34 means "move the disks from
  <code>
   left
  </code>
  to
  <code>
   right
  </code>
  ".  So at the end of the plan, disks 2 and 1 have been moved from
  <code>
   left
  </code>
  's list id2 to
  <code>
   right
  </code>
  's list id6.
 </p>
