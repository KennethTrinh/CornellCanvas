 # Q: how do we diagram a call frame for a loop?
</p>
<p>
 # A1: call frames are only for function calls.
</p>
<p>
 # A2:  example:
 <break>
 </break>
 #
</p>
<p>
 <break>
 </break>
 def make_more_sense():
 <break>
 </break>
 for i in range(4):   # range(4): 0, 1, 2, 3 .
 <break>
 </break>
 x = i+1
 <break>
 </break>
 # print("more sense")
 <break>
 </break>
 <break>
 </break>
 print("done!!!! ")
 <break>
 </break>
 make_more_sense()
 <break>
 </break>
 .........
</p>
<p>
 stack:
</p>
<p>
 [call frame make_more_sense
 <break>
 </break>
 inst. counter 14-&gt;15-&gt;14-&gt;15_&gt;...-&gt;14s
</p>
<p>
 i: 0-&gt;1 ... -&gt;3
 <break>
 </break>
 x: 1-&gt;2 ...&gt; 4
</p>
<p>
 ]
</p>
<p>
 <break>
 </break>
 tone#   if we said "append()" for strings, that should have been for lists.
</p>
<p>
 #Q how to handwrite an empty string vs one with a space
 <break>
 </break>
 #A: a "square U" (like a "[" but on its side)
</p>
<p>
 <break>
 </break>
 # q: x=1; y=2; x=y
 <break>
 </break>
 # A: for an assignment statement, righthand side is ALWAYS evaluated first, and the value goes into the variable on the left hand side .
</p>
<p>
 <break>
 </break>
 # how to turn an into a string?
 <break>
 </break>
 str(4) -&gt; "4"
 <break>
 </break>
 # what is a function that requires an str and not an int?
</p>
<p>
 print("x is: " + 4)
 <break>
 </break>
 Traceback (most recent call last):
 <break>
 </break>
 File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
 <break>
 </break>
 TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
</p>
<p>
 <break>
 </break>
 #Q for loop vs for-each loop
</p>
<p>
 # here is a for loop that is also a for-each loop
 <break>
 </break>
 # "for each" loops go through a list (or string)
 <break>
 </break>
 for x in ["oh", "my", "goodness"]:
 <break>
 </break>
 print(x)
 <break>
 </break>
 <break>
 </break>
 # here is a for loop that is not a for-each loop
 <break>
 </break>
 for i in range(len(["oh", "my", "goodness"])):
 <break>
 </break>
 print(i)
</p>
<p>
 # Q: parameter vs argument
 <break>
 </break>
 # parameter is variable that is declared in a function definition header, an argument is a value that is stored in a parameter/is given to the function as input
 <break>
 </break>
 2 cannot be a parameter
</p>
<p>
 def help_us_all(me, you, everyone_else):
 <break>
 </break>
 ...
 <break>
 </break>
 <break>
 </break>
 help_us_all("Prof, Lee", "Prof Fan", "cs1110 captive students")
</p>
<p>
 me, you, everyone_else &lt;- parameters ,drawn as boxes in a diagram
 <break>
 </break>
 the strings "Prof, Lee"  &lt;- placed in the boxes in a diagram.
</p>
<p>
 If p = "Prof Lee"
 <break>
 </break>
 help_us_all(p, "prof fan", "poor cs1110 students"
 <break>
 </break>
 me, you are parameters,
 <break>
 </break>
 argument would be the value of p (or "Prof Lee")
</p>
<p>
 #Q when do you do a foreach loop vs a range one
 <break>
 </break>
 #A: use range when you need to use the indices (the numbers) to access something or compute something
 <break>
 </break>
 #  use a for-each loop when it's more convenient.
</p>
<p>
 # see lab 12 (or the last one) --- could not do it with a for-each loop.
</p>
<p>
 # here is a loop that fails to change a input list
</p>
<p>
 <break>
 </break>
 &gt;&gt;&gt; thelist =  ["this", "that"]
 <break>
 </break>
 &gt;&gt;&gt; for s in thelist:  # foreach
 <break>
 </break>
 # we have a variable s
 <break>
 </break>
 ...     print(s)
 <break>
 </break>
 ...     s = "done"   # what is being changed is that variable x
 <break>
 </break>
 ...
 <break>
 </break>

 <break>
 </break>

 <break>
 </break>
 &gt;&gt;&gt; thelist

 ['this', 'that']

<p>
 &gt;&gt;&gt; thelist
 <break>
 </break>
 ['this', 'that']
 <break>
 </break>
 &gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(len(thelist)):
 <break>
 </break>
 ...     print(i)
 <break>
 </break>
 ...     print(thelist[i])
 <break>
 </break>
 ...     thelist[i] = "done"  # you are directly accessing the ith item in thelist and changing it.
 <break>
 </break>
 ...
 <break>
 </break>
 0
 <break>
 </break>
 this
 <break>
 </break>
 1
 <break>
 </break>
 that
 <break>
 </break>
 &gt;&gt;&gt; thelist
 <break>
 </break>
 ['done', 'done']
</p>
<p>
 #Q: can't I use for-each with indexing.
 <break>
 </break>
 # why that might not always work - this was an example of trying to use a for-each loop but still be able to change/access items in a list.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  if you want to work directly with positions, use "for .i.. range (...)", because that directly gives you index numbers; if you just want to work with the values in a list, just iterate through the values, which are give be "for x in whatever_list"
 </b>

<p>
 Q: so in a call frame, the line with the actual function call is not included in the instruction counter?
 <break>
 </break>
 A: that's right.
</p>
<p>
 Q: I have a question regarding returning lists-- do we return the ID of the folder or the list
 <break>
 </break>
 A: if you're asking what to
 <i>
  diagram,
 </i>
 return the id of the folder that is the list.
 <break>
 </break>
 In
 <i>
  code
 </i>
 , this looks like this
</p>
<pre>def do_the_thing():

    x = [1,2,3,4,5]
    return x   # you can't say, "return id1"</pre>
<p>

 )
 <break>
 </break>
 <break>
 </break>
 Q: can you type cast between str &lt;--&gt; int &lt;--&gt; float interchangeably? (am i missing any types that would work that we've learned in class?)
 <break>
 </break>
 A: types: str, int, float, boolean, list,
 <break>
 </break>
 not quite interchangeable: float(int(4.5)), you don't get 4.5 back.
</p>
<p>
 Q: Do we add the if statement line in the call frame even if the argument doesnâ€™t qualify for the if
 <break>
 </break>
 A: yes.
</p>
<p>
 if ("today" == "great day"): # even though false, the expression was evaluated; so write down the number.
</p>
<p>
 Q: is there a difference between writing if x == 5: or if x is 5: ?
</p>
<p>
 A: right now in CS1110, we don't have the background to understand a full answer.
</p>
<p>
 Pragmatically, for now, don't use "is", except for "is None".
</p>
<p>
 Q: what functions/methods can be used on ranges? can we treat them like lists?
 <break>
 </break>
 A: they are not technically lists. For CS1110 now, you probably shouldn't be treating them like lists (even though there are strong similarities).
</p>
<p>
 Q: do we write the line for a print statement? very confused if there is a print statement in a function, should that line be in call frame
</p>
<p>
 A: yes, the line number should be in the instructor counter --- the
 <i>
  output
 </i>
 of the print statement should not be in the frame, but somewhere else (draw a box that says "screen " or "output", like Python Tutor does. )
</p>
<p>
 Q: what to memorize
</p>
<p>
 A: see announcement.
</p>
<p>
 Q: What does % do/how do you do it by hand?
</p>
<p>
 A: it's the integer remainder, and you just have to calculate.
</p>
<p>
 20 divided by 10:    the answer is 2, and the remainder is 0. So, 20 % 10 is 0.
</p>
<p>
 9 divided by 2: the answer is 4, with remainder 1.  9 % 2 is 1.
</p>
<snippet language="py" line-numbers="true" runnable="true">
 <snippet-file id="code">
  x = 10
for i in range(1,11):
    print("i is: " + str(i) + " and 10 % i is:"  + str(10 % i))
 </snippet-file>
</snippet>
<p>
 Q: How do you write on the exam if a line of code continues but needs to go on another line on the paper?
</p>
<p>
 A: draw an arrow to the continuation
 <break>
 </break>
 <break>
 </break>
 Q: What do you do in a call frame or on a diagram for methods?
</p>
<p>
 A: for prelim 1, we're not going to ask you to do this; but the answer: it's like a function call.
</p>
<p>
 Q: methods vs functions:
 <break>
 </break>
 A: a method is a function associated with a particular type of object.  And it's called by &lt;name of object&gt;.&lt;name of function&gt;.
 <break>
 </break>
 Example: strip():   a call looks like "asdasd".strip()
 <break>
 </break>
 <break>
 </break>
 Q: Can we use assert type(s) == int to check for precondition?
</p>
<p>
 A: that's not Prelim 1 material. In practice, yes, often a good idea!
 <break>
 </break>
 <break>
 </break>
 Q: Within a function, can you call another function with a different parameter than the one in the original function?
</p>
<p>
 A: functions each have their own scratch space, which is their call frame!
 <break>
 </break>
