  # Q: how do we diagram a call frame for a loop?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  # A1: call frames are only for function calls.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  # A2:  example:
  <break>
  </break>
  #
 </paragraph>

  <break>
  </break>
  def make_more_sense():
  <break>
  </break>
  for i in range(4):   # range(4): 0, 1, 2, 3 .
  <break>
  </break>
  x = i+1
  <break>
  </break>
  # print("more sense")
  <break>
  </break>

  tone#   if we said "append()" for strings, that should have been for lists.

 <paragraph>
  #Q how to handwrite an empty string vs one with a space
  <break>
  </break>
  #A: a "square U" (like a "[" but on its side)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <break>
  </break>
  # q: x=1; y=2; x=y
  <break>
  </break>
  # A: for an assignment statement, righthand side is ALWAYS evaluated first, and the value goes into the variable on the left hand side .

  #Q for loop vs for-each loop
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  # here is a for loop that is also a for-each loop
  <break>
  </break>
  # "for each" loops go through a list (or string)
  <break>
  </break>
  for x in ["oh", "my", "goodness"]:
  <break>
  </break>
  print(x)
  <break>

  <break>
  </break>
  for i in range(len(["oh", "my", "goodness"])):
  <break>
  </break>
  print(i)
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  # Q: parameter vs argument
  <break>
  </break>
  # parameter is variable that is declared in a function definition header, an argument is a value that is stored in a parameter/is given to the function as input
  <break>
  </break>
  2 cannot be a parameter

  help_us_all(p, "prof fan", "poor cs1110 students"
  <break>
  </break>
  me, you are parameters,
  <break>
  </break>
  argument would be the value of p (or "Prof Lee")
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  #Q when do you do a foreach loop vs a range one
  <break>
  </break>
  #A: use range when you need to use the indices (the numbers) to access something or compute something
  <break>
  </break>
  #  use a for-each loop when it's more convenient.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  # see lab 12 (or the last one) --- could not do it with a for-each loop.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  # here is a loop that fails to change a input list

  <break>

  <break>
  </break>
  ['done', 'done']
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  #Q: can't I use for-each with indexing.
  <break>
  </break>
  # why that might not always work - this was an example of trying to use a for-each loop but still be able to change/access items in a list.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  <bold>
   if you want to work directly with positions, use "for .i.. range (...)", because that directly gives you index numbers; if you just want to work with the values in a list, just iterate through the values, which are give be "for x in whatever_list"
  </bold>

 <paragraph>
  Q: so in a call frame, the line with the actual function call is not included in the instruction counter?
  <break>
  </break>
  A: that's right.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Q: I have a question regarding returning lists-- do we return the ID of the folder or the list
  <break>
  </break>
  A: if you're asking what to
  <italic>
   diagram,
  </italic>
  return the id of the folder that is the list.
  <break>
  </break>
  In
  <italic>
   code
  </italic>
  , this looks like this
 </paragraph>
 <pre>def do_the_thing():

    x = [1,2,3,4,5]
    return x   # you can't say, "return id1"</pre>

  https://edstem.org/us/courses/3933/discussion/338568)
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  Q: can you type cast between str &lt;--&gt; int &lt;--&gt; float interchangeably? (am i missing any types that would work that we've learned in class?)
  <break>
  </break>
  A: types: str, int, float, boolean, list,
  <break>
  </break>
  not quite interchangeable: float(int(4.5)), you don't get 4.5 back.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Q: Do we add the if statement line in the call frame even if the argument doesn’t qualify for the if
  <break>
  </break>
  A: yes.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  if ("today" == "great day"): # even though false, the expression was evaluated; so write down the number.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Q: is there a difference between writing if x == 5: or if x is 5: ?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  A: right now in CS1110, we don't have the background to understand a full answer.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Pragmatically, for now, don't use "is", except for "is None".
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Q: what functions/methods can be used on ranges? can we treat them like lists?
  <break>
  </break>
  A: they are not technically lists. For CS1110 now, you probably shouldn't be treating them like lists (even though there are strong similarities).
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Q: do we write the line for a print statement? very confused if there is a print statement in a function, should that line be in call frame
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  A: yes, the line number should be in the instructor counter --- the
  <italic>
   output
  </italic>
  of the print statement should not be in the frame, but somewhere else (draw a box that says "screen " or "output", like Python Tutor does. )
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Q: what to memorize
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  A: see announcement.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Q: What does % do/how do you do it by hand?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  A: it's the integer remainder, and you just have to calculate.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  20 divided by 10:    the answer is 2, and the remainder is 0. So, 20 % 10 is 0.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  9 divided by 2: the answer is 4, with remainder 1.  9 % 2 is 1.
 </paragraph>
 <snippet language="py" line-numbers="true" runnable="true">
  <snippet-file id="code">
   x = 10
for i in range(1,11):
    print("i is: " + str(i) + " and 10 % i is:"  + str(10 % i))
  </snippet-file>
 </snippet>
 <paragraph>
  Q: How do you write on the exam if a line of code continues but needs to go on another line on the paper?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  A: draw an arrow to the continuation
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  Q: What do you do in a call frame or on a diagram for methods?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  A: for prelim 1, we're not going to ask you to do this; but the answer: it's like a function call.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Q: methods vs functions:
  <break>
  </break>
  A: a method is a function associated with a particular type of object.  And it's called by &lt;name of object&gt;.&lt;name of function&gt;.
  <break>
  </break>
  Example: strip():   a call looks like "asdasd".strip()
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  Q: Can we use assert type(s) == int to check for precondition?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  A: that's not Prelim 1 material. In practice, yes, often a good idea!
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  Q: Within a function, can you call another function with a different parameter than the one in the original function?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  A: functions each have their own scratch space, which is their call frame!
  <break>
  </break>
