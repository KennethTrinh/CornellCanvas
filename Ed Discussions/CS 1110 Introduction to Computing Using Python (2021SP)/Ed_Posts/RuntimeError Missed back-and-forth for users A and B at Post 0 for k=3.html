 Hi Professor, "
</p>
<p>
 I received the error message "Missed back-and-forth for users A and B at Post 0 for k=3". I do not understand what does "missed" mean and why did it happen?
</p>
<p>
 Thank you!
</p>

  Hi!  It means that there is a k=3 A-&gt;B back and forth at post 0, but your code seems to not report that there is one (returns False but shouldn't)
