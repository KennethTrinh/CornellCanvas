 I'm getting the following error when testing bnf_starts_here()

<p>
 But unless I've misunderstood the description there shouldn't be a back and forth at Post 0 for users A and D for k=3, since the length of the back and forth beginning at post 0 is 4. What does this mean?

  You're right that if you choose the post "011" of author A then you would have to return false. However, there exists another post by author A—particularly post "012"—that allows you to have a back and forth of length 3. By choosing post "012", you get the path "0" -&gt; "01" -&gt; "012".
