 I didn't receive a seating assignment for my in person discussion, which I understand is probably because I switched into it late and the webpage says seats are only updated weekly. I'm assuming I'll get my seat assignment next week, but what do I do for discussion this week? Can I just attend an online section?

  Prof. Fan is working on the seat assignments now, and a message should go out in an hour, I hope!
