 Hi,
</p>
<p>
 I tried looking over past final exams but the links for the solutions to the final exams
</p>
<list style="bullet">
</list>
<p>
 don't seem to be working.
</p>
<p>
 I get this message:
</p>
<heading level="1">

  (It's been an exciting week for the CS1110 website.  For some time this week, it accidentally got redirected to an empty summer2021 directory due to some website magic I knew but forgot to tell the Summer 2021 instructor about, and so a seemingly innocuous action they took hijacked our site!)
