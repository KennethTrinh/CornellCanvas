  Hello!
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  I noticed that Prelim 1 grades are updated on CMS (the official grading website for this course). However, my grade on CMS does not seem to include the points that I was rewarded after my regrade requests and to reflect the current score that I have on Gradescope.
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Which of these scores should I view as my "final" grade? Is there a reason why they are different?
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  Thanks for your help!

  From the announcement that just went out: "(yes, we accidentally released an pre-regrade versions of prelim 1 scores on CMSX, but believe we have accounted for the regrade requests now)".
