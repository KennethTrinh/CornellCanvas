  Hello,

  I believe the lab is only calculated into your grade if you missed more than 4 labs. If you do miss more than 4 labs, the profs reserve the right to drop your grade down a bit.

  This is from the website:

  "Then, we consult your lab check-in rates. Up to four labs may be dropped; more than that, and we reserve the right to reduce your course grade by the equivalent of a "level" (e.g., from B to B-)"
