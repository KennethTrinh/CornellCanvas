 How many points will be added for Labs to the grade calculated? Can I add the points to the grade calculated in the Atom file?

  Hello,
 </p>
 <p>
  I believe the lab is only calculated into your grade if you missed more than 4 labs. If you do miss more than 4 labs, the profs reserve the right to drop your grade down a bit.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is from the website:
 </p>
 <p>
  "Then, we consult your lab check-in rates. Up to four labs may be dropped; more than that, and we reserve the right to reduce your course grade by the equivalent of a "level" (e.g., from B to B-)"
 </p>
 <p>
  Best,
 </p>
 <p>
  Troy
