  So I finished Labs 3 &amp; 4 tonight, and I was wondering if I should still attend my discussion section tomorrow if I'm all done?

  Thanks!

  First, a quick note to all students: this class is designed
  <italic>
   expressly
  </italic>
  for students who have no programming/computing experience, and if you have questions or aren't clear about something in the lab exercises, we on the course staff have all signed on to the Good Ship CS1110 precisely so that we have the opportunity to help you!
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  But if your circumstances are that you complete the pair of labs without having any questions (conceptual or curiosity-driven), and if there are no questions on the pair of labs requiring you to see a lab staff member, then you do not need to come to discussion section for that week.
