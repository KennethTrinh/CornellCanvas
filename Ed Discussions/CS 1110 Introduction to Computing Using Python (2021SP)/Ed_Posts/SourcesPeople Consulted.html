 What types of sources should be cited in the #Sources/people consulted: FILL IN OR WRITE "NONE" line in the header of all assignments? If I asked some clarifying questions during a 1:1 with a TA should I site that TA?

  Just in case write any person that helped you on the assignment. If you have a lot of people on there it’s completely fine

   Also do note the exception in the
   <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs1110/2021sp/policies/cs1110integrity.html">
    collaboration policy
   </a>
   (which, of course, you have read as part of A1) given in item 4:
   <break>

  </p>
  <blockquote>

   "(4) You should specifically acknowledge by name all help you received, whether or not it was "legal" according to rules (1)-(3) above. This is also known as "citing your sources".
   <i>
    Exception

   : you do not need to acknowledge the course staff (although we appreciate it if you do!)."
