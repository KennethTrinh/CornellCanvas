  To add on, the instructions say you can do so on Canvas. However, there isn't a link showing on it. So I have a similar question

  I see the following in today's lecture chat:

 <blockquote>
  09:33:00 From Aidan McNay to Everyone : I think there was an email before from Cornell indicating all the materials you had with instant access, and it should have a link to opt out 09:33:04 From Sinahy Fragoso-De la Paz to Everyone : https://online.vitalsource.com/#/

  But let me enable the Instant Access link on Canvas,
  <italic>
   hoping
  </italic>
  this doesn't cause other students to think they need to use it!

  I tried enabling Instant Access and the Canvas page and checked the link ---
  <link href="https://courses.vitalsource.com/"/>
  https://courses.vitalsource.com/ --- and then deactivated the Canvas link again.  I'll put this info as an "answer".

  The textbook is available free online and is meant to be used only as (optional) reference material for the course. The link is available on the course website as the first item in the "Frequently Accessed Servers" section.

  For those trying to opt out from Instant Access (TM)'s version of the textbook: I'm not sure, but do you get offered the ability to opt out from hitting either of the two locations?

  I don't see anything for this class when I hit either link, only materials from other classes.  I'm not sure if anyone else has had any luck though.

  I

   temporarily

  saw the book for this course, and it seems that wasn't enough.

  Are you able to opt out now? (I have re-enabled and now am leaving Instant Access for the course.)
