  I am trying to test my sd_utilities_list file, but the given menu_listing function is not outputting the correct string. Are we supposed to be modifying it like in sd_utilities_dict? I thought this given function was correct.

 <paragraph>
  It is outputting:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  0: A 1: A 2: A 3: A 4: E 5: D 6: D 7: E
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  instead of:
 </paragraph>
 <paragraph>
  0: B 1: A 2: D 3: E
 </paragraph>

  Your menu_listing seems to work, but not your process_line function.

  Best of luck! :)
