 I noticed on the class schedule, it says that while-loop lecture material will be included on Prelim 2, but the study guide says it will not. Can we expect to see while-loops on Prelim 2?

  Hi! The two remarks are actually consistent, believe it or not...

  We weren't sure if we would do some review of non-while-loop material in today's lecture (Apr 15), so we included this lecture in the coverage.
  <break>
  </break>
  <break>
  </break>
  BUT, we also excluded while-loops from prelim 2, since you wouldn't have a homework or lab on the topic before the exam.

  So, what is on prelim 2 from today's (Th Apr 15) would be an appreciation for when for-loops are natural --- see slides 19,  21, 24.
